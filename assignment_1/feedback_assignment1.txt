******* Feedback Assignment 1 *********

- do not do wishful thinking
- comment on everything but keep it concise

Plotting:
- bar plots and scatter plots are the most clear formats for degree distribution (no connecting lines)
- title, axis labels and legends !!
- comparison plots should be in the SAME plot (with the proper alpha (transparency) setting, so they cannot conceal the data)
- remove node labels on the network if they are not readable and if we don't need them

Formatting:
- Repeat questions and separate questions from answers visually (different colors/boxes or sections)
- Notebook pleasant to read
- Nice to Have:
	- References of theory
	- Explain in the markdown what the next cell is doing
- Nice to Remove:
	- outputs for testing purpuse
	- the duplicates

Network:
- 2000 nodes and 18000 links approximately
- Remove the self-loops - especially if you see them on the plot
- Beware of the multi-edges
