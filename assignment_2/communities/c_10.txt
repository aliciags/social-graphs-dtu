The band's self-titled album was released on September 27, 2019 followed by \"Tornillo\" in July 29, 2022.\n\nThe band started when friends Cody Cannon and John Jeffers began learning guitar together, inspired by the music of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Waylon Jennings]], amongst many other artists. After being joined by Cannon's co-worker and friend Cody Tate. After playing together for a while, the three decided to start a more serious band. They enlisted friend Jeff Hogg to play drums, and asked Cannon's cousin Gary Brown to play bass (although he did not know how to play the instrument at the time). They began playing shows around their hometown and native state of Texas, slowly starting to build a following on the Texas/Red Dirt scene.\n\nIn 2018, the band was featured in four episodes of the [[Kevin Costner]] [[Paramount Network]] series [[Yellowstone (American TV series)|''Yellowstone'']].

That initial effort featured the singles, \"Fade Away\" (a top 5 single on the Texas Music Chart), \"Could Have Been My Baby,\" and the title track.\n\nIn 2012 Baird followed up ''Blue Eyed Angels'' with ''I Swear It's The Truth'', named one of the top twenty albums of the year by [[Spin Magazine]].<ref name=\"121217-19-rob-baird\">{{cite web| url = https://www.spin.com/2012/12/best-country-albums-2012/121217-19-rob-baird/| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160326072337/http://www.spin.com/2012/12/best-country-albums-2012/121217-19-rob-baird/| archive-date = 2016-03-26| title = Rob Baird \u2013 I Swear It's the Truth (Carnival) SPIN}}</ref>  ''I Swear It's The Truth'' featured the hit single, \u201cDreams and Gasoline\u201d which was added to [[XM]]\u2019s \"[[The Highway (Sirius XM)|The Highway]]\" and was featured in the ABC drama ''[[Nashville (2012 TV series)|Nashville]]''.

Three of his songs have also been used in season three of [[The CW|CW]]'s ''[[Hart of Dixie]]'' (\"Same Damn Thing\" in episode 10, \"More Than Willing\" in episode 17, and \"40 Days and 40 Nights\" in episode 20).\n\nOver the years, Baird has kept an active touring schedule balancing support slots with [[Jason Isbell]], [[Billy Joe Shaver]], [[The Steeldrivers]], [[Don Williams]], and many others with developing an impressive string of headlining dates in several major markets.\n\nBaird relocated to Austin, Texas in 2015 and recorded his third record, ''Wrong Side of the River,'' released on May, 13th, 2016 on Baird's label Hard Luck Recording Company. Produced by Brian Douglas Phillips, the album presents a stark contrast to some of Baird's previous work. ''Wrong Side of the River'' is laden with the blues of Memphis and the outlaw [[alt-country]].\n\nIn 2016 \"Mississippi Moon\" and \"Cowboy Clich\u00e9\" from ''Wrong Side of the River'' were featured on the Netflix original series ''The Ranch''.\n\nBaird's highly anticipated fourth record ''After All'' was released January 11, 2019.\n\n==Critical reception==\n\nRoughstock Country gave ''I Swear It's the Truth'' 4.5/5 stars, saying \"Everything about ''I Swear It's The Truth'' suggests a young artist ready to break into the big leagues.\"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.roughstock.com/reviews/album-review-rob-baird-i-swear-it-s-the-truth |title=Album Review: Rob Baird - I Swear It's the Truth &#124; Country Music Reviews, Taylor Swift to Lady Antebellum &#124; Roughstock.com |access-date=June 19, 2014 |archive-date=April 15, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415064019/http://www.roughstock.com/reviews/album-review-rob-baird-i-swear-it-s-the-truth |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n[[Spin Magazine]] included ''I Swear It's the Truth'' on their \"Top Albums of 2012\" list, calling him a \"young, affable folk-pop charmer.\"<ref name=\"121217-19-rob-baird\"/>\n\nBaird was featured in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s \"Spotlight\" section in May 2012 covering the release of ''I Swear It's the Truth''.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/485451/spotlight-rob-baird-spreads-truth-with-new-album|title=Spotlight: Rob Baird Spreads 'Truth' with New Album|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the Dallas Observer slated Baird's \"Dreams and Gasoline\" to be one of the 50 best Texas Red Dirt Songs<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/the-50-best-red-dirt-texas-country-songs-7055741|title=The 50 Best Red Dirt Texas Country Songs}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Baird premiered a three-part video series featuring songs from ''Wrong Side of The River'' on NPR, stating that the videos and the music were \"a thematic journey from defiance to reflection to the hope for redemption\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/event/music/476464506/rob-baird-wrong-side-of-the-river-trilogy|title = First Watch: Rob Baird, 'Wrong Side of the River' Trilogy|newspaper = NPR|date = May 3, 2016|last1 = Sinnenberg|first1 = Jackson}}</ref> No Depression stated that ''Wrong Side of The River'' as \"Wrenching punches to the gut, with powerhouse blues rock and soul, as well as poignant pulls on our hearts with heart-rending ballads\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nodepression.com/article/rob-baird-has-run-good-luck |title=Rob Baird Has a Run of Good Luck {{!}} No Depression |website=nodepression.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619155022/http://nodepression.com/article/rob-baird-has-run-good-luck |archive-date=2016-06-19}}</ref> Spin Magazine described ''Wrong Side of The River'' as \"Baird takes his traditional country to a deeper place, with sparse acoustic chords allowing his reflective lyricism to breathe\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2016/04/rob-baird-horses-premiere-stream/|title = Rob Baird Finds New, Folk-Laden Path with 'Horses'|date = April 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=rob baird|chart=all}}|title=Rob Baird Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US<br />Heat]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=rob baird|chart=Heatseekers Albums}}|title=Rob Baird Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Heatseekers Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=May 31, 2012}}</ref>\n|\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Blue Eyed Angels''\n| \n* Release date: August 31, 2010\n* Label: Carnival Recording Company\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''I Swear It's the Truth''\n| \n* Release date: May 22, 2012\n* Label: Carnival Recording Company\n| 57\n| 35\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Wrong Side of the River''\n| \n* Release date: May 13, 2016\n* Label: Hard Luck Recording Company\n| 48\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''After All''<br />\n|\n*Release date: January 11, 2019\n* Label: Hard Luck Recording Company\n| 32\n| 2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Anthems''<br />\n|\n*Release date: May 19, 2022\n* Label: Carnival Recording Company\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

He then signed with Columbia Records for \"Step Right Up\" and another live album.\n\nIn 2003, Robison was a judge on the first season of the TV singing competition ''[[Nashville Star]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usanetwork.com/series/nashvillestar/theshow/characterprofiles/robison/index.html |title=USA Network &#124; Nashville Star - Character Profile: Charlie Robison - Judge |website=www.usanetwork.com |access-date=13 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061113050913/http://www.usanetwork.com/series/nashvillestar/theshow/characterprofiles/robison/index.html |archive-date=13 November 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nUnhappy with the expectations and limitations of being a Nashville country artist, he moved to a smaller independent label, Dualtone, for ''Good Times'' in 2004, followed by extensive touring and newfound control over his career. Accordingly, his sound began to evolve away from mainstream/Nashville country and toward more [[Southern rock|Southern]] and [[hard rock]] influences.\n\nFive years after the release of \"Good Times,\" Robison released ''Beautiful Day'' on June 23, 2009, on Dualtone. This was the first album he self-produced. Both albums featured several songs written by Nashville singer-songwriter Keith Gattis.\n\nHis song \"Good Times\" was featured in the credits of [[HBO]]'s original series ''[[True Blood]]'' in the first season's third episode.\n\nIn 2009, he embarked on an [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] tour with stops in Little Rock, Nashville, Atlanta, Raleigh, New York City, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Iowa City, and Memphis to promote ''Beautiful Day''. Since then he has played primarily in Texas, with occasional shows in Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Colorado.\n\nRobison was known for playing [[classic rock]] covers during his live shows.\n\nHis live band included Mark Tokach (lead guitar), Abe Combest (drums), Zeke Benenate (bass) J.C. Burt (steel guitar) and Chris Valdez (road manager and additional guitar). Prior to Beautiful Day, his band was known as The Enablers, and included Keith Robinson (drums), Scott Esbeck (bass) and Travis Woodard (drums). Other notable members have included Kim Deschamps (pedal & lap steel, mandolin and guitar from 2000\u20132009), Kevin Carroll (guitar), Jason Bryl (bass), Chris Grady (bass), Louis Landry (keyboards and accordion), and Kris Brown (bass). His recordings have also featured special guests Lloyd Maines (who produced \"Step Right Up\" and \"Good Times\"), Rich Brotherton, Charlie Sexton, and Natalie Maines (duet on \"The Wedding Song\" and harmony vocals on \"El Cerrito Place\").\n\nIn September 2014, Robison opened Alamo Icehouse in San Antonio, Texas, with former Major League Baseball player [[Brooks Kieschnick]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lucio |first=Valentino |date=September 13, 2014 |title=Downtown ice house & BBQ joint opens |url=https://blog.mysanantonio.com/food/2014/09/downtown-ice-house-bbq-joint-opens/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210412225612/https://blog.mysanantonio.com/food/2014/09/downtown-ice-house-bbq-joint-opens/ |archive-date=April 12, 2021 |website=Blog.mysanantonio.com}}</ref>\n\nOn September 24, 2018, Robison announced that due to complications from surgery, he was permanently unable to sing, and that he was officially retiring from stage and studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tasteofcountry.com/charlie-robison-retirement-lost-voice-surgery/|title=Untitled|website=tasteofcountry.com|date=September 24, 2018}}</ref> Robison resumed his music career in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Trigger |date=2022-09-28 |title=Texas Country Legend Charlie Robison is Exploring a Comeback |url=https://www.savingcountrymusic.com/texas-country-legend-charlie-robison-is-exploring-a-comeback/ |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=Saving Country Music |language=en-US}}</ref> He returned to Billy Bob's as part of his first tour since 2018, playing at the same venue where he first played in 1999.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Charlie Robison |url=https://billybobstexas.com/events/charlie-robison |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230604032706/https://billybobstexas.com/events/charlie-robison |archive-date=June 4, 2023 |access-date=2023-04-10 |website=Billy Bob's Texas |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life and death==\nRobison's brother, [[Bruce Robison]], and his sister, Robyn Ludwick, are also singer-songwriters.\n\nRobison married [[Emily Robison|Emily Erwin]] of [[The Chicks]] at the [[Cibolo Creek Ranch]] in May 1999,<ref name=\"dixiechicksmemberwedsinwesttexas\">{{cite news|title=Dixie Chicks member weds in West Texas|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/18936484/?terms=%22Cibolo%2BCreek%2BRanch%22|accessdate=February 16, 2016|work=The Kerrville Times|page=16|location=Kerrville, Texas|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-access=registration |quote=Emily Erwin of the Texas-born group married fellow Texan and musician Charlie Robison on Saturday at Cibolo Creek Ranch in the Big Bend.}}</ref> with whom he had three children.

The Great Divide formed its own [[record label]], publishing company and operating company, and began recording. The group's first two albums, ''Goin' For Broke'' and ''Break In The Storm'', were independent releases. [[Atlantic Records]] signed the group and re-released ''Break In The Storm'' as well as the band's third album, ''Revolutions''. ''Remain'', the group's fifth album, was released independently at the end of 2002.\n\nThe Great Divide originally consisted of bassist Kelley Green, singer-songwriter [[Mike McClure]] and brothers Scott and J.J. Lester (rhythm guitar and drums, respectively). McClure left the band in early 2003 to pursue a career highlighting his originals and helping other bands record albums. The band continued with new singer Micah Aills but broke up after the release of \"Under Your Own Sun\" in 2005.<ref>{{cite news|first= Chip |last= Chandler |title= Great Divide makes amends, joins for reunion shows |date= February 8, 2012 |access-date= June 14, 2022 |url= \nhttps://www.amarillo.com/story/entertainment/local/2012/02/08/divide-makes-amends-joins-reunion-shows/13135190007/}}</ref>\n\nOn August 26, 2011, the original members reunited for an appearance and are still together today touring.<ref>{{cite news|first= Laurie |last= James |title= Bridging the Great Divide Seminal Red Dirt band reunites for Stillwater show |date= September 1, 2011 |access-date= June 14, 2022 |url= \nhttps://lonestarmusicmagazine.com/bridging-the-great-divide/}}</ref> The album \"25 Years of the Great Divide\", comprising 31 tracks, was released to celebrate their 25th anniversary in 2018.

The band was formed in 2011 by [[Cody Canada]], the former lead vocalist and guitarist for [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] after that band broke up in 2010. The band currently consists of Canada (guitars and lead vocals), Jeremy Plato (bass guitar and vocals), and [[Eric Hansen (drummer)|Eric Hansen]] (drums).\n\n==Formation==\nAfter Oklahoma based southern rock band [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] broke up in 2010, [[Cody Canada]] decided to start the Departed that was billed by Texas and Oklahoma music scene observers as a \"Super Group.\" Canada remained on lead vocals and lead guitar and former Ragweed bass guitar player Jeremy Plato joined Canada. Canada recruited friend and Texas based blues rock singer and songwriter Seth James to be co-lead on guitar and vocals, well known red dirt keyboardist Steve Littleton, and fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma]] native Dave Bowen on drums. Naming themselves \"The Departed\" as all had left previous bands to join together, the group at first billed themselves as \"Cody Canada and The Departed\" namely for fan recognition according to the band members in a 2011 interview.\n\n==''This Is Indian Land''==\nThe band released its first album in June 2011 titled ''This Is Indian Land'' through its own record label, Underground Sound. The record was a tribute album to Oklahoma music and songwriters. The band's cover version of the Red Dirt Rangers song \"Staring Down the Sun\" was the only released single from the album. Two other songs, \"The Ballad of Rosalie\" and \"Skyline Radio\" both charted on the Texas and Oklahoma music charts.\n\n==''Advent\u016bs''==\nOn August 24, 2012, now billed as simply The Departed, the band announced on its website and in social media that it would release its first original album, ''Advent\u016bs'' (Latin for \"arrival\") on November 13, 2012, on Underground Sound. Bowen had left the group and was replaced by Chris Doege on the drums. The band moved to an [[alternative rock]] and grunge sound with driving electric guitars and the power vocals of James and Canada. Three singles were released: \"Worth The Fight\", \"Prayer For the Lonely\" and \"Flagpole\".\n\n==''HippieLovePunk'' & Line-Up Changes==\nIn September 2013, Seth James announced that he intended to leave the band. The parting was amicable; as James said. \"After three years of great times and great music, I have decided to take a step down as a band member of the Departed. It has been an unbelievable ride and I am so grateful for the support and love along the way. My last show will be November 23 at Gruene Hall. I look forward to supporting these guys alongside you as they continue down the road.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/cody-canada-announces-the-departed-lineup-changes-new-solo-acoustic-live-album-due-this-fall/article/3883601 |title=Cody Canada announces The Departed lineup changes, new solo acoustic live album due this fall |author= Brandy McDonnell |date= September 16, 2013 |work=NewsOK }}</ref> The band continued performing as a four-piece group.\n\nIn 2014, the band finished a new album, ''HippieLovePunk''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/5-minutes-in-texas-with-cody-canada-20140721 |title=5 Minutes in Texas With Cody Canada|author= Jim Casey |date=July 21, 2014 |magazine= Rolling Stone }}</ref> It was released on January 13, 2015, and debuted at No. 9 on the Top [[Alternative Country]] Albums chart, with 4,700 copies sold in the US in its first week.

In late November 2015, the band produced a music video for the song \"All Nighter\" on ''HippieLovePunk'' at John T. Floore's Country Store in [[Helotes, Texas]]. The song and the video were dedicated to the former bass guitar player for [[Micky and the Motorcars]] Mark McCoy, who had died in [[Idaho]] in 2012 while on vacation. The songs \"Inbetweener\" and \"Easy\" were released as singles.\n\n==''Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect''==\nIn early 2016, the band announced on social media that it would be releasing an album consisting of cover versions of classic country songs. This project was named ''Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect'', honoring 1960s era country music with songs by [[Johnny Paycheck]], Stonewall Jackson and [[Charlie Walker (musician)|Charlie Walker]], among others. The bass guitarist, Plato, took the lead vocals and had Canada, Smith and Hansen as his backing on the project. [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly's]] Cody Braun and Cody Angel of Jason Boland and the Stragglers contributed their instrumentation to the project, as well as the folk singer Jamie Lin Wilson, who sang backing vocals and also appeared on a popular duet with Plato.\n\n==''3''==\nIn early 2017, Ross Smith left the band and The Departed became a 3 piece set with Canada, Plato, and Hansen. On April 20, 2018 the band released the single \"Lipstick\" from their new album ''3'', that was released on June 29, 2018, by the Underground Sound Label. [[Mike McClure]], who had produced several of Cross Canadian Ragweed's albums, came back to produce the album. The name of the album comes from the number of those who were left in the band. It was also their 3rd album of original content as '''In Retrospect''', and '''Indian Land''' had both been cover albums.\n\n==Current==\nDue to the band's current lineup, several popular Cross Canadian Ragweed songs have made their way back into the Departed's nightly set list in addition to the new material the band has written. Canada said in a 2018 Rolling Stone interview that he was \"truly happy with the way the band is now and I feel this is the band I have always wanted, and really deserved.\"\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cody canada|chart=Country Albums C}}|title=Cody Canada Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cody canada|chart=Billboard 200}}|title=Cody Canada Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Billboard 200|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Independent Albums|US<br />Indie]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cody canada|chart=Independent Albums}}|title=Cody Canada Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Independent Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''This Is Indian Land''\n| \n* Release date: June 21, 2011\n* Label: Underground Sound\n| 13\n| 68\n| 11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Advent\u016bs''\n| \n* Release date: November 13, 2012\n* Label: Underground Sound\n| 19\n| 133\n| 16\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''HippieLovePunk''\n| \n* Release date: January 13, 2015\n* Label: Underground Sound\n| 9\n| 136\n| 9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''3''\n| \n* Release date: June 29, 2018\n* Label: Red 11 Music\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

Two years later came ''Hey You'' via Lucky Dog, a division of [[Epic Records]], which accounted for a No.&nbsp;64 country single in \"How Many Days\". In 2000, he collaborated with [[Charlie Robison]] and [[Bruce Robison]] for the live album ''Unleashed Live''.\n\n''[[Electric (Jack Ingram album)|Electric]]'', his second album for Lucky Dog, was also his first album to enter [[Top Country Albums]], despite not producing a chart single. This album was supplemented a year later by an [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''Electric: Extra Volts'' before he left Lucky Dog. Two more live albums followed before he signed to [[Sony Music Nashville|Columbia Nashville]] for the release of ''Young Man'' in 2004, which accounted for no singles. Another live album, ''Acoustic Motel'', was issued in 2005.\n\nOn Sunday, February 3, 2013, [[H-E-B]] premiered their 'Texas Myths' Super Bowl commercial featuring Jack Ingram.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLcSPOZoBPw|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206002258/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RLcSPOZoBPw|url-status=dead|archive-date=2013-02-06|title=H-E-B 2013 Game Day Commercial: Texas Myths - YouTube|website = [[YouTube]]|date=February 6, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===2005\u20132011: Big Machine Records===\nIn 2005, Ingram signed to the independent record label [[Big Machine Records]]. Under the Big Machine banner, Ingram released a predominantly live album entitled ''[[Live: Wherever You Are]]''. His first single release on that record label, \"[[Wherever You Are (Jack Ingram song)|Wherever You Are]]\", became Ingram's first top 40, and later his first and only Number One single on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as well as the first Number One for the Big Machine label. \"[[Love You (song)|Love You]]\", the only other studio track on ''Live: Wherever You Are'', was also released as a single, peaking at No.&nbsp;12 on the charts. This song was also recorded by [[Trent Summar & the New Row Mob]] (whose frontman, Trent Summar, co-wrote it) on their 2005 album ''Horseshoes & Hand Grenades''.\n\nIn late 2006, Ingram released a cover of [[Hinder]]'s song \"[[Lips of an Angel]]\". Ingram's cover peaked at No.&nbsp;16 on the country charts \"Lips of an Angel\" was the lead-off single to ''This Is It'', his second album for Big Machine. This album also produced the No.&nbsp;18 \"[[Measure of a Man (Jack Ingram song)|Measure of a Man]]\" (a [[Radney Foster]] co-write) and the No.&nbsp;24 \"[[Maybe She'll Get Lonely]]\".\n\nIn 2008, Ingram appeared at the Argyle Education Foundation Black Diamond Affair.\n\nHe won the [[Academy of Country Music]] award for top new male vocalist on May 19, 2008.

Signed to the independent [[Big Machine Records]] label in 2005, Peck released her self-titled debut album, which produced the Top 30 country hits \"I Don't\", \"[[Findin' a Good Man]]\", and \"Isn't That Everything\". A fourth single, \"Bad for Me\", charted in mid-2007. Peck is now heard as a host on \"Y2 Kountry\" a country music radio station on [[Sirius XM]] radio.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\n[[Image:Danielle Peck autographs.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Danielle Peck signs autographs for sailors during the [[Spirit of America (company)|Spirit of America]] tour, May 31, 2007]] Peck was born in [[Jacksonville, North Carolina|Jacksonville]], North Carolina, but was raised in [[Coshocton, Ohio|Coshocton]], Ohio. She is the daughter of a United States [[Marine (military)|Marine]]. Her parents both came from musical backgrounds. Her mother's side of the family traveled and sang in churches. Her fathers' parents and grandparents were steeped in country music, playing dances in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_az_danielle_peck/article/0,,GAC_26129_4702985,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903223858/http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_az_danielle_peck/article/0,,GAC_26129_4702985,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 3, 2012 |title=Danielle Peck > Biography |publisher=[[Great American Country]] |accessdate=April 19, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe first song she ever sang was [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Folsom Prison Blues]],\" which she continues to perform in her live shows to this day. She wrote her first song before the age of 10. She also sang in her church, as solo and as part of a choir. At age 16, she joined a band called ''The Neon Moon Band'', which performed around the local area.\n\nAfter graduating from [[River View High School (Warsaw, Ohio)|River View High School]] in 1997, Peck formed her own band that performed at festivals and other events. She then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Tennessee, finding work as a [[waitress]] while pursuing a career in country music. While in Nashville, she met Clay Myers, a publisher who signed her to a deal as a songwriter with Barbara Orbison's Still Working Music. Peck soon started writing for her staff members.\n\n===Musical career===\nSoon, Peck signed a recording contract with [[DreamWorks Records]], with executive [[Scott Borchetta]]. She was working on her debut album when DreamWorks folded and Borchetta founded his own record company entitled [[Big Machine Records]], which would go on to be the record company for artists like [[Taylor Swift]] and [[Tim McGraw]].\n\nIn 2005, she released her debut single, \"I Don't\" (co-written with Clay Mills and Burton Collins). The song peaked at number 28 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Peck then released her [[Danielle Peck (album)|eponymous debut album]] in June 2006. The album peaked at number 23 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart and produced two more Top 30 singles in \"[[Findin' a Good Man]]\" (her highest-charting single to date) and \"Isn't That Everything\". Also in 2006, Peck took part in a duet with fellow country singer [[Jack Ingram]] on his 2006 album ''[[Live: Wherever You Are]]'', titled \"Never Knocked Me Down,\" which was an audio excerpt from the [[Country Music Television|CMT]] program ''Outlaws 2005''.\n\nPeck released her fourth single in early 2007. Titled \"Bad For Me,\" the single (which was co-written by Australian country singer [[Sherri\u00e9 Austin]]) was intended to be the lead-off to an upcoming second album. \"Bad For Me\" failed to reach the Hot Country Songs Top 40 (number 46), however, and the second album's release date was delayed until late 2008. That album, titled ''Can't Behave'', was released on December 23 of that year, though it was only available through digital retailers. The title track to ''Can't Behave'' was then released as a single in January 2009. The single, however, failed to chart altogether, and Peck parted ways with Big Machine shortly afterward.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1606224/country-rosters-remain-stable-despite-sales-downturn.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305134112/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1606224/country-rosters-remain-stable-despite-sales-downturn.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 5, 2009|title=Country Rosters Remain Stable Despite Sales Downturn|publisher=[[Country Music Television]]|accessdate=April 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2007 ALCS controversy===\nIn 2006, Peck briefly dated [[Boston Red Sox]] pitcher [[Josh Beckett]].

The group was then signed to [[Monument Records]] and released two hit albums, before departing from Monument in 2000 and founding their own label, Open Wide Records, in association with [[Columbia Records]]. They then released their third album [[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]] to critical acclaim. During a London concert ten days before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], lead vocalist Maines stated, \" Just so you know, we're on the good side with y'all, we don't want this war, this violence, and we're ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas\" (the trio's home state). The statement offended their core fan base who thought it rude and unpatriotic, and the ensuing controversy cost the group half of their concert audience attendance in the United States and led to accusations of the three women being un-American, as well as hate mail, death threats, and the public destruction of their albums in protest.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.today.com/popculture/dixie-chicks-shut-sing-toronto-wbna14822593 |title=Dixie Chicks 'Shut Up and Sing' in Toronto |date=September 13, 2006 | publisher=Today.com |access-date=October 8, 2006}}</ref>  The group followed a small hiatus with a live album and a documentary highlighting the maelstrom  created by Maines' comment entitled ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]]''.

She is the lead vocalist for the country band [[the Chicks]].\n\nIn 1995, after leaving [[Berklee College of Music]], Maines was recruited by the Dixie Chicks to replace their lead singer, Laura Lynch. With Maines as lead vocalist, the band earned 10 [[Country Music Association Awards]] and 13 [[Grammy Award]]s for their work between 1998 and 2007.\n\nIn 2006, with Maines still acting as lead singer, the Dixie Chicks released ''[[Taking the Long Way]]''. The album subsequently won five [[Grammy Awards]] (including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]). After dropping the \"Dixie\", the Chicks new album ''[[Gaslighter (album)|Gaslighter]]'' was released on July 17, 2020. As a solo artist, Maines released the album, ''[[Mother (Natalie Maines album)|Mother]]'', on May 7, 2013.\n\n== Early life ==\nMaines was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], to country musician and producer [[Lloyd Maines]] and Tina May Maines. She attended Nat Williams Elementary School in Lubbock, where her second grade teacher recalls being told by Maines during a math lesson, \"Teacher, I don't need to learn this stuff\u2014I'm gonna be a star.\"<ref name=\"Dickerson\" /> Maines was a cheerleader while attending O.

My parents sent me and my sister to public minority schools so I always felt like a hippie and a rebel. ... As a teenager I always loved not thinking in the way I knew the majority of people thought. I always stood up for minorities. ... I've always stood up for homosexuals. I just always had these really strong convictions about doing so.\"<ref name=\"Heysen\">Heysen, Kristen.

She spent two semesters pursuing an undeclared major at [[West Texas A&M University|West Texas A&M]] where her studies focused heavily on radio, then a year and a half at [[South Plains College]]. One of Maines's instructors at South Plains, and a former member of [[The Maines Brothers Band]], Cary Banks, recalled \"She was mostly into [[rock'n'roll]], [[rhythm and blues]] ... [[alternative rock]].\" When Banks encountered Maines on campus, he said that she usually needed to vent a little steam. \"She would get into a lot of political arguments\" at the predominantly Republican school, and was a fan of Texas Governor [[Ann Richards]]. \"She's always been opinionated and hardheaded like her dad.\"<ref name=\"Dickerson\" />  In December 1994, Maines auditioned for and received a full vocal scholarship to Berklee College of Music. She pursued the diploma program at Berklee but dropped out before the completion of her studies. Even though Maines is from Lubbock, home of [[Texas Tech University]], she attended only one class at the school, a 1995 summer course in \"Introductory Wildlife\".<ref name=\"Dickerson\" />\n\n== Career ==\nMaines's first professional recording was lead vocals on the song \"White Women's Clothes\" on Andy Wilkinson's album \"Charlie Goodnight's Life in Poetry and Song.\" Maines's first commercially released work was [[backing vocalist|background vocals]] on [[Pat Green]]'s debut album, ''Dancehall Dreamer'', produced by her father Lloyd Maines and released in 1995. At the end of 1995, at age 21, Maines joined the all-female [[country music]] band, the then named [[Dixie Chicks]], which had been performing since 1989, but which had been unsuccessful in gaining more than local attention. Maines replaced founding lead singer Laura Lynch.

By the time he hit high school, he was regularly playing in bars and local venues in town. A summer program at [[New York University]] exposed Cartwright to the world outside of Dallas and inspired him to head even further from home to attend the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], Massachusetts where he studied music business and songwriting. During college, he worked odd jobs in the music industry, including a stint as a wedding singer. Upon graduating in 2012, Cartwright moved back to Texas to pursue his own music career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berklee.edu/berklee-today/fall-2014/alumnotes|title=Alumnotes {{!}} Berklee College of Music|website=www.berklee.edu|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== 2013\u20132015 ===\nSoon after returning to Dallas, Texas, he recorded an EP, ''Bull Run'', earning him recognition at the 2013 [[B.

Later that year, he signed a worldwide publishing deal with Warner/Chappell Music, the music publishing arm of Warner Music Group, and signed with Red Light Management. By June 2018, Warner Music Nashville announced that it had signed Cartwright to its label as a country music recording artist and songwriter. Later that year, Cartwright began working with Grammy Award-winning producer David Garcia on his next project.\n\nIn Summer of 2019, Cartwright released his first music through Warner Music Nashville with Love Like We Used To and Hung Up On You. SiriusXM The Highway selected Love Like We Used To as its \"YouTube Country Spotlight\" and added the song to its \"On The Horizon\" programming. In Fall of 2019, My First Beer was released, and Cartwright's latest release, Cake For Breakfast, was featured on Billboard's \"First Country,\" as one of the best new country songs of the week. Cartwright is currently releasing music and playing live shows across the country.\n\nCartwright has shared the stage and toured with several notable acts including [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]], [[Green River Ordinance (band)]], [[Turnpike Troubadours]], [[Randy Rogers Band]], [[William Clark Green]], [[Rob Baird]], [[Stoney LaRue]], [[Wade Bowen]], [[Sean McConnell]], [[Cody Jinks]] and more.\n\n== Discography ==\n{{BLP unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[Top Country Albums|US<br/>Country]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[Heatseekers Albums|US<br/>Heat]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[Heatseekers Albums|US<br/>Heat S.C.]]\n|-\n| style= \"text-align: left;\"|''Troy Cartwright'' \n|\n*Released: February 3, 2015\n*Label: Independent\n| \u2013 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\" |\"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart.\n|}\n\n===EPs===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17em;\"| Album details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[Top Country Albums|US<br/>Country]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[Heatseekers Albums|US<br/>Heat]]\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| [[Heatseekers Albums|US<br/>Heat S.C.]]\n|-\n| style= \"text-align: left;\"|''Bull Run''\n|\n*Released: June 11, 2013\n*Label: Independent\n| \u2013 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014\n|-\n| style= \"text-align: left;\"|''Don't Fade''\n|\n*Released: October 7, 2016\n*Label:  Hard Luck Recording Co.\n| \u2013 || 60 || 53 || 8\n|-\n| colspan=\"12\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%;\" |\"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart.\n|}\n\n=== Singles ===\n* 2015: \"Next Flight Home\"\n* 2016: \"Busted\"\n* 2017: \"Somebody Else's Problem\"\n* 2020: \"Hung up on you\"\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://troycartwright.com/ Official Website]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cartwright, Troy}}\n[[Category:1990 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Berklee College of Music alumni]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Texas]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

The band relocated to [[Austin, Texas]] in October 1996.\n\n==History==\nLed by brothers Willy (vocals/guitar) and Cody Braun (vocals/fiddle/mandolin/harmonica), the alternative country-rock outfit Reckless Kelly formed in Stanley, Idaho in February 1996 before moving to Austin, Texas. The Brauns had previously toured with their father in Muzzie Braun & the Boys, a Western swing band, and were joined in their own group by the lead guitarist Casey Pollock, the bass guitarist Chris Schelske and the drummer Jay Nazz.\n\nWith their younger brothers Micky and Gary, Cody and Willy were raised in [[central Idaho]] near the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Mountains]], between [[Clayton, Idaho|Clayton]] and [[Challis, Idaho|Challis]] in [[Custer County, Idaho|Custer County]], and were homeschooled by their mother. Originally they were \"Muzzie Braun & the Little Braun Brothers\", as Muzzie and his brothers Gary and Billy were the \"Braun Brothers\" from [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]] in the 1970s and early 1980s, sons of the musician Eustaceus \"Mustie\" Braun.<ref name=bbhra>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eJVfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JDEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3614%2C1990319 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho)|last=McCarthy |first=John |title=Braun Brothers hit the road again for tour |date=June 22, 1990 |page=1D}}</ref><ref name=lntobitmmb81>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tJxfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tjEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5698%2C1808942 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=(obituary) |title=Mustie and Marian Braun, former Lewiston residents |date=February 20, 1981 |page=5C}}</ref> From [[North Dakota]], Mustie was a neighbor and relative of the bandleader [[Lawrence Welk]], and was a keyboard player during the last days of legalized gambling in Idaho at [[Weiser, Idaho|Weiser]] in the early 1950s.

They turned Lucy's Retired Surfers Bar, a small bar and restaurant, into a noted music venue with their Monday night residency from November 1996 to May 1998. During this period, other music venues in Austin invited them to play, including the Continental Club, the Saxon Pub, [[Stubb's Bar-B-Q|Stubb's Barbecue]], and Antone's Home of the Blues.\n\nReckless Kelly's first album, ''[[Millican (album)|Millican]]'', appeared in fall 1997 and was officially released in 1998. ''[[Acoustic: Live at Stubb's]]'' and ''[[The Day (Reckless Kelly album)|The Day]]'' followed two years later, after which David Abeyta replaced Pollock on lead guitar. ''[[Under the Table and Above the Sun|Under the Table & Above the Sun]]'' in 2003 began the band's relationship with the high-profile Sugar Hill label and won the hearts of the music press and the honky tonkin' legend [[Joe Ely]], who sang the band's praises in interviews. ''[[Wicked Twisted Road]]'' was released in 2005, and the next year the live album ''[[Reckless Kelly Was Here]]'' captured the band's stage presence. ''[[Bulletproof (Reckless Kelly album)|Bulletproof]]'' was released in summer 2008 on a new label, [[Yep Roc Records]], and includes tracks critical of and reflecting on recent sociopolitical unfoldings, such as the [[Iraq War]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In 2010, Reckless released an album of songs by one of their musical heroes, Pinto Bennett. ''[[Somewhere in Time (Reckless Kelly album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', in the band's own words, highlighted their love of \"straight-up honky tonk\". The band regularly returns to Austin to play before capacity crowds at venues like Nutty Brown Cafe & Amphitheatre.\n\nYounger brothers Micky and Gary Braun front their own band, [[Micky & The Motorcars]]. Both bands play at the annual Braun Brothers Reunion in Challis, Idaho, in August.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Millican (album)|Millican]]''\n|\n* Release date: July 7, 1998\n* Label: [[Cold Spring (label)|Cold Spring]]\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[The Day (Reckless Kelly album)|The Day]]''\n|\n* Release date: October 31, 2000\n* Label: [[Valley Entertainment]]\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Under the Table and Above the Sun|Under the Table & Above the Sun]]''\n|\n* Release date: May 13, 2003\n* Label: [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]]\n| 67\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Wicked Twisted Road]]''\n|\n* Release date: February 8, 2005\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n| 66\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Bulletproof (Reckless Kelly album)|Bulletproof]]''\n|\n* Release date: June 24, 2008\n* Label: [[Yep Roc Records]]\n| 22\n| 117\n| 2\n| 14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Somewhere in Time (Reckless Kelly album)|Somewhere in Time]]''\n|\n* Release date: February 9, 2010\n* Label: Yep Roc Records\n| 22\n| 146\n| 2\n| 15\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Good Luck & True Love''\n|\n* Release date: September 13, 2011\n* Label: No Big Deal/Red Eye\n| 20\n| 78\n| \u2014\n| 18\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Long Night Moon''\n|\n* Release date: September 3, 2013\n* Label: No Big Deal/Red Eye\n| 22\n| 106\n| \u2014\n| 22\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Sunset Motel''\n|\n* Release date: September 23, 2016\n* Label: No Big Deal/Thirty Tigers\n| 12\n| 191\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''American Jackpot / American Girls''\n|\n* Release date: May 22, 2020 (Digital)\n* Release date: July 24, 2020 (CD)\n* Label: No Big Deal/Thirty Tigers\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Live albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\" | Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Acoustic: Live at Stubb's]]''\n|\n* Release date: June 6, 2000\n* Label: Valley Entertainment\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Reckless Kelly Was Here]]''\n|\n* Release date: August 8, 2006\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n| 56\n| 41\n| 38\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Compilations ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Best of the Sugar Hill Years (Reckless Kelly album)|Best of the Sugar Hill Years]]''\n|\n* Release date: July 10, 2007\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

After forming The Great Divide with J.J.

In 2004, The Mike McClure Band released their first album [[Everything Upside Down]], a hard-hitting rock album.

She won awards in national fiddle championships while still a teenager. Maguire is accomplished on several other instruments, including the mandolin, viola, double bass and guitar. She has written and co-written a number of the band's songs, some of which have become chart-topping hits. She also contributes her skills in vocal harmony and backing vocals, as well as orchestrating string arrangements for the band.\n\nMaguire learned several instruments at a young age, honing her skills with her younger sister, [[Emily Strayer]] (born Emily Erwin) and two schoolmates (a brother and sister team, Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]) for over five years as a part of a touring bluegrass quartet while in high school. After graduation, the sisters forged an alliance with two other women they had met through the Dallas music scene, [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]] and Robin Lynn Macy, forming a bluegrass and country music band, [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits for six years. After the departure of Macy, and the replacement of Lynch with singer [[Natalie Maines]], the band widened their musical repertoire and appearance. The result was a trio so commercially successful that it took the country music industry by surprise, with 19 singles hitting the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Charts]], 2 Diamond Albums, 2 Platinum albums, and 13 [[Grammy Awards]].  Maguire subsequently stood by her bandmates as they were engulfed in a 2003 controversy for [[Dixie Chicks controversy|criticizing George W. Bush]], which led to the Chicks being [[blacklisted]] by many country radio stations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tyrangiel |first1=Josh |title=Chicks in the Line of Fire |url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1196419,00.html |access-date=October 5, 2022 |publisher=Time Magazine |date=May 21, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMartha Elenor Erwin, nicknamed Martie, was born October 12, 1969, in [[York, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"TV guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/martie-maguire/256027 |title=Martie Maguire News, Martie Maguire Bio and Photos |publisher=TVGuide.com |access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref>\n\nEncouraged by her parents &ndash; educators at private schools &ndash; Maguire began playing violin at age five, and by age 12, started to learn to play \"[[fiddle]] style\" after receiving a birthday gift of fiddle lessons.<ref name=\"Ladies Home Journal\">[http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/lhj/story/data/martiemaguirecelebprofile_01132003.xml]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> She also was active in her school orchestra.<ref name=\"Gilchriest\">[http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219045902/http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm|date=December 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHer sister Emily shared her love and interest in music, and displayed early talent herself.

The band consisted of [[Cody Canada]] (lead guitar/vocals), Grady Cross (guitar), [[Randy Ragsdale]] (drums), and Jeremy Plato (bass guitar). The group released five studio albums and three live albums from 1994 until 2010. The band was at the forefront of the rise of the red dirt music scene in Oklahoma and the Texas Music scene. After almost 15 years together, the group disbanded in 2010.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nCross Canadian Ragweed started when Randy Ragsdale met Cody Canada, Matt Weidemann, and Grady Cross, who had also been playing together. The four had known each other since grade school and started playing together in Ragsdale's home seven nights a week under the tutelage of Ragsdale's father, Johnny, who had worked with musical artists in the area. After playing together, the band officially formed by combining a part of every band member's last name, coming up with the name Cross Canadian Ragweed. Matt Weidemann left the band, and Jeremy Plato joined the band, playing the bass guitar. After finishing high school, the band moved to the [[College Town]] of [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], where acts like Mike McClure's [[The Great Divide (band)|The Great Divide]] and singer-songwriter [[Jimmy LaFave]] had established enough of a local scene to earn Stillwater the nickname North Austin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/north_austin_stillwater_ok_nickname/|title=Barry Popik|website=Barrypopik.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===''Carney'' and ''Live And Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon''===\nThe group had already received significant [[college radio]] [[airplay (song)|airplay]] before it released its first album, ''Carney'' in 1998 on their own independent label. Initially, selling the band in the market it was based in, was considered by music observers to be far-fetched; however, the fan base's passion and loyalty to the band allowed them to find success in releasing that first album. Carney was well received, then the band released ''Live and Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon'' in 1999, which was also well received, especially in the local scene.\n\n===''Highway 377''===\nRagweed released its second studio album Highway 377 in 2001, though it was recorded in 1999. It propelled them into wider audience and into [[Texas]], where Canada was born and also where the band had been touring heavily. Though not a released single, the song \"Long Way Home\" was featured on several [[Dodge]] Truck Commercials in both Texas and Oklahoma which added to the popularity of the band. The band paid tribute to drummer Randy Ragsdale's father Johnny, who has passed away from cancer in 1997 with the track \"Johnny's Song.\"\n\n===''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas''===\nIn 2002 Ragweed recorded the popular live album ''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas'' in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The songs were mainly live versions of songs off ''Carney'' and ''Highway 377'', with a handful of cover songs.\n\n===''Cross Canadian Ragweed (Purple Album)''===\nIn 2002, the group then signed with [[Show Dog Nashville|Universal South]] Records and released a self-titled album also alternately known as 'The Purple Album'.  It was a tribute to the band's \"little sister\" Mandy Ragsdale, the younger sister of the band's drummer Randy Ragsdale, who had died in an auto accident near [[College Station, Texas]], and whose favorite color was purple. The album produced charted singles \"17\" and the ballad \"Constantly\", and released a music video for the hard rock track \"Don't Need You.\"\n\n===''Soul Gravy''===\nRagweed's 2004 album, ''[[Soul Gravy]]'', debuted at No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard charts. [[Lee Ann Womack]] provided background vocals on the popular single \"Sick and Tired\". The project also saw the re-release of the song \"Alabama\" (off of 2001's Highway 377) with a heavier electric sound, which appeared on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Charts]] as well.\n\n===''Garage''===\nIn October 2005 the band released ''Garage'', described by both the band and raters at [[AllMusic]] as the group's \"grungiest album ever.\" Two songs, \"Fighting' For\" and \"This Time Around\" both became hits off the album. The album charted higher than any studio album the band ever released and for the first time, the band broke into rock radio airplay across the United States due to the song \"Dimebag\", a tribute to former [[Damageplan]] and [[Pantera]] guitarist \"Dimebag\" [[Darrell Abbott]], who had been killed months earlier during a concert, in addition to a heavier rock sound overall.\n\n===''Back To Tulsa: Live And Loud At Cain's Ballroom''===\nIn late 2006, Ragweed released their third and final live album, ''Live and Loud At Cain's Ballroom'' in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The band's 24 song project was well received and featured songs from their previous projects The Purple Album, Soul Gravy, and Garage. It also featured a handful of covers as well such as [[Neil Young]]'s [[The Needle and the Damage Done]] and [[Robert Earl Keen]]'s \"Lonely Feeling.\"\n\n===''Mission California''===\nCross Canadian Ragweed recorded ''[[Mission California]]'', their fourth studio album, at the end of March 2007. The namesake of the album was due to the recording taking place in [[San Diego]], California. The band spent 25 days in the studio; the first 5 cutting 15 tracks, the next 20 polishing each. [[Lee Ann Womack]] once again laid down background vocals on 4 of the tracks to include the [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] cover \"Cry Lonely.\" ''[[Mission California]]'' was released on October 2, 2007. AllMusic reviewed the Album and found that the project was \"name appropriately, the band sounds much more a progressive West Coast sound in many of the tracks and less rural rock.\"\n\n===''Happiness and All the Other Things''===\nThe band's tenth and final album, ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was released on August 31, 2009, commemorating the band's 15th Anniversary. It featured 12 new studio tracks and three live tracks. Recorded in California, this album includes a track entitled \"51 Pieces\", which Canada penned with Micky Braun. The song was based on an incident where Ohio State police ransacked the band's bus after a stop in Cleveland at the [[House of Blues]]. It also featured \"Blue Bonnets\" which is dedicated to Cody's oldest son Dierks. ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was officially dedicated to the late Randall Locke ([[Willie Nelson]]'s long-time stage manager) who suddenly died on May 6, 2009. Other popular tracks were \"To Find My Love\", \"Burn Like The Sun\", and \"Kick In The Head.\"\n\n=== Hiatus and band break-up ===\nIn May 2010, Cross Canadian Ragweed announced a hiatus from touring.  In a band press release, Ragsdale explained, \"Right now, I need to be at home for my family, particularly my son JC, who has autism. He's 10 years old now and still struggling in his development. I feel the only way I can help him is to be more hands on and close to home.\" Despite Ragsdale wanting to \"get another drummer and press on,\" Canada stated \"We\u2019ve always said from the start, we\u2019re Ragweed as the four of us, or not Ragweed at all.\"<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cross Canadian Ragweed cancels Oklahoma City Family Jam  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701165713/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |archive-date=July 1, 2012  }}</ref> In September 2010, Canada officially announced the band was calling it quits by announcing their  \"Last Call Show\" in October 2010 at Joe's Bar in Chicago, IL, stating \"as far as that\u2019s concerned, Oct 24 is the last one, the last gig.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caller.com/news/2010/sep/16/cross-canadian-ragweed-frontmans-career-evolves/|title=Cross Canadian Ragweed frontman's career evolves|website=Caller.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Post break-up ===\nSince Cross Canadian Ragweed, Canada and Plato formed [[The Departed (band)|The Departed]] with fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma|Yukon]]-native Dave Bowen (drums), Seth James (guitar), and Steve Littleton (keyboards), releasing their debut album \"This Is Indian Land\" in June 2011.<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cody Canada & The Departed digging into red dirt roots with debut album, \"This Is Indian Land\"  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707211521/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |archive-date=July 7, 2012  }}</ref>\nRagsdale and Cross both returned to Yukon.

Canada said that rock bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Soundgarden]] all were a part of the influence on the band's sound as well as country music influences [[Merle Haggard]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Robert Earl Keen]], in addition to southern rockers [[Marshall Tucker Band]], and [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], among others. Due to their unique sound, the band often had a hard time getting radio airplay on either mainstream rock or country stations.\n\n==Notable appearances==\nThe band frequently played with other stars of the [[Red Dirt (music)|Red Dirt]] and Texas Music scene including [[Stoney Larue]], [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers]], [[Micky & The Motorcars]], [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly]], (Canada's brother-in-law) [[Wade Bowen]], [[No Justice]], Johnny Cooper, Seth James, and [[Brandon Rhyder]].\n\nThe band played with country music star [[Dierks Bentley]] numerous times.

Strayer plays [[banjo]], [[dobro]], guitar, lap steel, [[Upright bass|bass]], [[mandolin]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]], [[piano]], and [[sitar]]. Initially in her career with the Chicks, she limited her singing to harmony with backing vocals, but within her role in the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], she took on the role of lead vocalist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nEmily Erwin was born in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]. Parents Paul Erwin and Barbara Trask moved the family to the suburban town of [[Addison, Texas]], on the northern edge of [[Dallas]], where she was raised with her two older sisters, Julia and [[Martie Maguire|Martha]]. Her parents were both educators and nurtured the growing interest that both Emily and Martha (later nicknamed Martie) shared, and together both sisters became proficient on several instruments while in elementary school.\n\nEmily began playing the violin at age seven, and the [[banjo]] at age ten, afterward learning all the [[string instruments]] she could find.<ref name=\"Malkin\">Malkin, Nina [http://chickoholic.tripod.com/DixieChicks/id8.html \"A Little About Martie\"], Dixie Chicks Henhouse (Retrieved December 31, 2007).</ref> Years later, Martie joked that Emily was better than she at the fiddle, and because she wanted to keep the fiddle as her instrument, she forced Emily to learn something else.<ref>{{cite video | title=[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]] |date=2006 | medium=Motion picture |publisher=[[The Weinstein Company]]}}</ref> Emily responded by mastering the five string banjo, by reading books to teach herself the [[chord progressions]].<ref name=\"Malkin\"/>\n\nFrom 1984\u20131989, Jane Frost (Director of the [[Patsy Montana|Patsy Montana Museum]] and the [[Walnut Valley Festival]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]]) remembers watching the sisters mature, teaming up with schoolmates Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]. The foursome were touring in a teenage [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group they named the Blue Night Express, in part because of the amount of traveling they had to do to reach far away festivals, frequently with a parent or friend of the family towing them back home long after dark at night. They thought it was worth the sacrifices to meet their musical heroes and experienced the friendly camaraderie and tricks of the trade on instruments from others. The sisters were said to have an \"almost obsessive\" interest in [[busking]] at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals.<ref name=Frost>{{cite web|last1=Frost|first1=Jane|title=Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, KS, Early 1980s|url=http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml|website=The All-Inclusive Dixie Chicks Page|date=July 15, 1999|access-date=December 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002233114/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml|archive-date=October 2, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Faraway Hills\">[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html \"Sharon Gilchrist\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182257/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, Faraway Hills (Retrieved February 12, 2008).</ref> After Martie graduated from secondary school at [[Greenhill School (Addison, Texas)|Greenhill School]] with Emily still completing her studies, both remained active in the bluegrass scene.\n\n==The Chicks==\n[[File:Emily Robison with the Dixie Chicks 1998.jpg|thumb|200px|left|With the Dixie Chicks; 1998]]\n\nIn 1989, after years of attending [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[festivals]] and [[busking]] where they could, Emily joined her sister Martie, guitarist Robin Lynn Macy, and [[upright bass]] player [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]]. Frost, again, recalls being privy to the discussion that the four women had about the possibility of a successful career as musicians together. Martie felt they could do well. Robin said, \".. It's going to be a 'hot' band,\" to which Emily responded, \"I give it six months, and if we aren't making money by then, I'm out of here!\".<ref name=\"Frost\" /> Strayer was shy, and the youngest member of the group. She had enjoyed playing throughout school, but was at an age where she was already entertaining thoughts of working hard to be accepted by the [[United States Air Force Academy]].<ref name=\"Clark\">Clark, Renee [http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml \"Can the Dixie Chicks make it in the big time?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304191833/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/dlife392.shtml |date=March 4, 2016 }} ''Dallas Life Magazine'' in ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'', March 1, 1992 (Retrieved January 23, 2008).</ref>\n\nBy 1993, the band had evolved into a new direction. Macy left the group for a \"purer\" [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] sound. Lynch, thrust into the position of sole lead singer, was replaced by the sisters in 1995 with singer composer [[Natalie Maines]] after the group was unable to garner anything more than local interest.<ref name=\"Dickerson\">Dickerson, James L. (2000) ''Dixie Chicks: Down-Home and Backstage''. Taylor Trade Publishing, Dallas, Texas. {{ISBN|0-87833-189-1}}.</ref> Strayer commented, \"We were prepared to pay our dues for as long as it took; we were prepared for longevity. We know that we will always be playing music together, so we wanted to find someone who is just as determined and energetic as we are.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nBut in later interviews, the sisters revealed what many had thought for a long time: the reason Lynch was replaced was not commitment but a perceived lack of talent.  In an article in the April/May edition of ''Country Music Magazine'', Emily stated, \"We felt we needed the next calibre of singer.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[File:Emily-Robison.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Strayer in concert with the [[Dixie Chicks]], Austin, Texas, 2006]]\n\nFrom there, massive commercial success ensued, with their 1998 and 1999 albums ''[[Wide Open Spaces (album)|Wide Open Spaces]]'' and  ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' both achieving [[diamond record]] status. Strayer was a key element of the group's look, with her hair dyed blond to match the other two at first, and then allowing it to return to her natural brunette color, and distinguishing herself visually from the other two. Strayer and Maguire's instrumental virtuosity set the Dixie Chicks apart from many other country acts, male and female. Strayer's songwriting has also been a factor in the Chicks' recording career. <!-- needs expansion, reference to particular songs -->\n\nStrayer stood by Maines when the controversy over Maines' remarks about U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] hit the newswire on the eve before the [[Iraq War]] in 2003. She was the only bandmate to realize that - while in the U.K., there was a big anti-war sentiment in the audience - back in the United States, Maines' criticism of President Bush would not be well received. Nevertheless, even when her home was trashed,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} and plenty of editorials were predicting the end of the Dixie Chicks' successful careers in music, she remained loyal to Maines, as did her sister.\n<!-- needs expansion, reference regarding the success of the Chicks in general -->\n\n==Court Yard Hounds==\n[[File:Emily-Robison 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Strayer with the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]] at Antone's, [[SXSW]], March 18, 2010]]\nStrayer spent at least half of her life busking and touring nearly non-stop since high school, first with her older sister, and then with the changing lineups of the Dixie Chicks. After the bandmates celebrated their five [[Grammy Award]]s for ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', the trio all had young children and took time out to spend with them, but Strayer was eager to return to writing and touring. When Strayer's marriage came to an end, she began expressing herself by songwriting. Some of her compositions include her feelings about the breakup with her former husband, and expected that soon, the band would resume its former schedule of writing and performing, but Natalie Maines was reluctant to do so. After four years, Strayer became \"angry and frustrated\", and in sending her new songs to her sister, conveyed her increasing disappointment.<ref name=\"All Things Considered\">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126554419|title=Dixie Chicks Musicians Strike Out on Their Own|last=Block|first=Melissa|date=May 6, 2010|work=[[All Things Considered]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|access-date=October 3, 2010}}</ref> With Natalie Maines taking a break from music, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine announced in January 2010 that Emily and sister Martie have formed a side project called the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], with Strayer as lead vocalist.

He acquired a taste for music after attending a [[George Strait]] concert with his parents at the age of four. The next day he asked for a guitar.  Canada first started playing guitar at the age of eight. While Cody was a teen, the Canada family relocated to [[Yukon, Oklahoma]]. As a teenager Canada was drawn to rock bands such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pearl Jam]] and also [[outlaw country]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\n==Cross Canadian Ragweed==\n{{main|Cross Canadian Ragweed}}\nIn 1994, Canada along with fellow musicians Matt Weidemann (bass), Grady Cross (guitar), and Randy Ragsdale (percussion) formed Cross Canadian Ragweed in [[Yukon, Oklahoma]].

From the time of Ragweed's formation until its end in 2010, the band released seven studio albums as well as three live albums.\n\nIn 2010, the band went on an extended hiatus due to slight tensions inside the band, and Ragsdale's family responsibilities, eventually breaking up in late 2010.\n\n==The Departed==\n{{main|The Departed (band)}}\nIn 2011, Canada and Plato formed a new band, initially called Cody Canada & the Departed.

They released their first album in June 2011 titled ''This Is Indian Land'', consisting of covers written by Oklahoma songwriters.\n\nOn August 24, 2012, the band, now billing themselves as The Departed, announced through their website and social media that they would release their first original album titled ''Adventus''. The album was released on November 13, 2012.\n\nIn September 2012, the band announced that they would release one song from ''Adventus'' every Monday leading up until the album's release on their Facebook artist profile.\n\nIn 2014 the band announced a third studio album.  ''Hippielovepunk'' was released on January 13, 2015.  The album debut at No. 9 on the Billboard US Country chart as well as No. 9 on the US Indie chart.  The first single was a return to the Red Dirt sound of CCR titled ''Inbetweener''.\n\n==Solo work and collaborations==\nOn November 19, 2013, Cody Canada released a solo acoustic 2-disc album ''[[Some Old, Some New, Maybe a Cover or Two]]''.

The band consists of [[Natalie Maines]] (lead vocals, guitar, bass guitar) and sisters [[Martie Maguire]] (vocals, fiddle, [[mandolin]], guitar) and [[Emily Strayer]] (vocals, guitar, banjo, [[Dobro]]). Maguire and Strayer, both n\u00e9e Erwin, founded the band in 1989, with bassist Laura Lynch and vocalist and guitarist Robin Lynn Macy. They performed [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]], [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a [[major label]]. In 1992, Lynch replaced Macy as the lead vocalist.\n\nAfter releasing three independent albums, the Dixie Chicks signed to [[Monument Records|Monument Records Nashville]] in 1997, by which point Maines had joined. They achieved success with their albums ''[[Wide Open Spaces (album)|Wide Open Spaces]]'' (1998) and ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' (1999). After Monument closed its Nashville branch, the Dixie Chicks moved to [[Columbia Records]] for ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'' (2002). These albums achieved [[multi-platinum]] sales in the United States, Canada, and Australia, along with several charting singles on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Their successful US singles were \"[[There's Your Trouble]]\", \"[[Wide Open Spaces (song)|Wide Open Spaces]]\", \"[[You Were Mine]]\", \"[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]\", \"[[Without You (Dixie Chicks song)|Without You]]\", and a cover of [[Bruce Robison]]'s \"[[Travelin' Soldier]]\". The Dixie Chicks also reached number one on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart with their 2002 cover of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s \"[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]\".\n\nDays before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Maines [[Dixie Chicks comments on George W. Bush|told a London audience that the Dixie Chicks did not endorse the war]] and were ashamed of US President [[George W. Bush]] being from Texas. The remarks triggered boycotts in the US and a backlash from fans. After a hiatus, the Dixie Chicks recorded ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' in 2006, an album informed by the backlash. \"[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]\" became their biggest crossover single, reaching number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. After a second hiatus, Maguire and Strayer recorded as a duo called [[Court Yard Hounds]]. The Dixie Chicks reunited to tour in the 2010s. In 2020, they removed \"[[Dixie]]\" from their name due to negative connotations, and released their first album in 14 years, ''[[Gaslighter (album)|Gaslighter]].''\n\nThe Chicks have won 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, including five in 2007 for ''Taking the Long Way,'' which received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], and its single \"[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]\", which received the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]].
