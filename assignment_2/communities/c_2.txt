The trio was signed to [[Show Dog Nashville]], a label owned by [[Toby Keith]], in 2007. After recording the song \"Off the Hillbilly Hook\" for the [[soundtrack]] to Keith's film ''[[Beer for My Horses (film)|Beer for My Horses]]'', Trailer Choir charted the singles \"What Would You Say\", \"Rockin' the Beer Gut\" and \"Rollin' Through the Sunshine\" on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. These singles were followed by an [[extended play]] called ''Off the Hillbilly Hook'' and an album called ''Tailgate''. Hoyt departed the group in February 2011. The remaining members took a small hiatus in 2012, but started touring again in 2013 before ending their career again in 2016.\n\n==Background==\nTrailer Choir was founded in 2004 by Marc Fortney, known as Butter, along with Vinny Hickerson and Crystal Hoyt, who are respectively known as Big Vinny and Crystal in the group.<ref>{{cite news |first=Carl E. |last=Feather |title=Making his bread as Butter |url=http://www.starbeacon.com/archivesearch/local_story_331174033.html |work=[[Star Beacon]] |date=2007-11-27 |accessdate=2009-10-14 }}</ref> Trailer Choir had originally started as a loose association of musicians, usually including Fortney and Hickerson, that played cover shows at fraternities and clubs in order to make some money and have some fun, rather than as an intended career path.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bio|url=http://www.jambase.com/Artists/53495/Trailer-Choir/Bio|work=Trailer Choir|publisher=JamBase.com|accessdate=7 April 2012}}</ref> Wanting to add original music without losing the audience led the group to writing and playing the party anthem style they are known for. They then started performing original shows during the week, while continuing to play the frat houses and clubs on the weekend.\n\nAt one performance in late 2006, a fan named Crystal Hoyt jumped on the stage and took over Hickerson's microphone, thus becoming a member of the band until she parted ways with them in early 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stromblad|first=Cory|title=Trailer Choir Becomes Duo With Departure of Crystal Hoyt|url=http://www.theboot.com/2011/02/01/trailer-choir-crystal-hoyt-leaves/|work=The Boot|publisher=TheBoot.com|accessdate=7 April 2012|date=February 1, 2011}}</ref> Not long after Hoyt joined them, Toby Keith showed up at one of their original performances on \"The Billy Block Show\" at a club called 12th & Porter.

Some of Stephen's closest friends are from that time in his life and considers Michigan just as much a hometown as Kentucky and Tennessee. After moving from [[Eastern, Kentucky]], to Tennessee, he was raised in Nashville's songwriting and recording community. He watched his father, Steve Cochran, wrestle with the machinery of Music Row as a struggling songwriter and artist. Country greats [[Bobby Bare]] and the late [[Del Reeves]] are just a few of the characters that influenced Cochran's early music home life. Cochran cultivated an interest in music beginning at [[Hunters Lane Comprehensive High School]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Later, he honed his craft in his college days at [[Western Kentucky University]] with a development deal. He worked his way through school writing songs and playing guitar. While at WKU he also helped found and played lacrosse.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}\n\nAfter September 2001 Cochran joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] and served his country as a Marine in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was a part of the [[2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion]]; [[1st Marine Expeditionary Force]]. While on convoy security Cochran was injured, leaving his back broken and without the use of his legs for some time. He was told he may never walk without pain again and he was sent home to the United States. Once he arrived home the search for a solution began.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}} Finally, after a long struggle, Cochran's ability to walk without pain was restored when doctors at the Nashville VA Medical Center performed an experimental procedure called [[kyphoplasty]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url = http://www.richmond.com/business/article_013e4fec-4932-510d-865f-6ca8bc0983ec.html|title = McGuire Veterans research studies are recognized|last = Smith|first = Tammie|date = April 24, 2010|work = [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]|access-date = September 26, 2015}}</ref> After an extensive rehabilitation Stephen was able to return to an active lifestyle. As part of his recovery, Cochran refocused his energy on country music.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}\n\nCochran teamed up with other country music artists and began performing with [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]] and the [[MuzikMafia]] around Nashville. He wrote with his friend from the band [[Trailer Choir]] Vinny Hickerson and eventually, they started their own writers' group. In 2007 he began [[Armed Forces Entertainment]] tours of the Middle East, scores of benefit appearances on behalf of his fellow veterans, and constant roadwork in support of his acclaimed, self-titled debut album. In November 2008 Cochran appeared on ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' to promote the second annual \"Salute to the Troops\" benefit concert.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.countryhound.com/stephen-cochran-to-appear-at-uso-concert-in-new-york|title = Stephen Cochran To Appear At USO Concert in New York|date = November 6, 2008|accessdate = September 26, 2015|website = CountryHound|last = Smith|first = Andrea|archive-date = September 26, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150926062354/http://www.countryhound.com/stephen-cochran-to-appear-at-uso-concert-in-new-york|url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|VA]] asked Cochran to be the face of their research and development. He and [[Mark Melloan]] wrote \"Hope,\" which the VA used as a theme song in its national campaign to help veterans. The VA hospitals and patients are the backdrops for the video.\n{{Blockquote|I'm one of the only combat vets from this era in country music, and I need to use that platform to help things change and give hope back.|Stephen Cochran|'' News Channel 5 WTVF, February 11, 2010'' <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=11974461|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203182703/http://www.newschannel5.com/Global/story.asp?S=11974461|title=Marine Veteran Turned Country Artist Beats Odds|date=February 11, 2010|archivedate=February 3, 2014|work=NewsChannel5.com}}</ref>}}\n\nIn 2012, Cochran signed a production contract with [[New Voice Entertainment]].{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}\n\nIn 2013, Cochran formed the live-music group titled \"Stephen Cochran Project\" including bandmate \"Smitty\" Byrne (BGV/Bass).

They use their songs and songwriting to help other's understand the Veterans plight as well as the suicide epidemic that plagues the Veteran Community. \"It also helps our fellow veterans heal through our music\", said Dean at a concert in 2017 at the Fonanel.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}\n\nCochran then teamed up with fellow veteran and longtime friends Michael Hamilton and Daniel Broadrick to put out a non-genre EP titled \"American Loser\", it includes 6 new tracks all written or co-written by Cochran and Hamilton directed at helping other veterans heal and educate civilians about the veteran lifestyle. Cochran, Hamilton and Broderick continue to make music and are hoping to help many veterans navigate the songwriting maze in Nashville.{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}\n\nIn 2020 Cochran was contacted by Hallmark Movies to buy the rights to his life.
