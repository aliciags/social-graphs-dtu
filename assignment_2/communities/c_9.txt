After a disc jockey at [[KPLX]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, began playing \"Mrs. Steven Rudy\", another track from the album, other nearby stations soon followed suit. Due to the reaction the song was receiving in this market, the label released it as McGuinn's first single, with \"That's a Plan\" on the [[B-side]].<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=273|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}</ref>\n\nUpon the release of \"Mrs. Steven Rudy\", McGuinn was considered a \"[[dark horse]]\" on the country music scene, due in part to his jazz background and [[beatnik]] image, which were considered outside the norms of country radio.<ref name=\"dark\"/> \"Mrs. Steven Rudy\" was a top ten hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, and the highest-selling single on the country singles sales charts for five consecutive weeks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://magazine.angrycountry.com/article.php?story=20051122111856391 |title=Mark McGuinn a Happy Man at Radio |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |date=November 22, 2005 |work=AngryCountry.com}}</ref> His album entered the [[Top Country Albums]] chart at number 18, setting a new record for the highest entry on that chart for the first release from an independent label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1443996/20010523/mcguinn_mark.jhtml |title=McGuinn Breaks SoundScan Record |accessdate=December 14, 2007 |date=May 24, 2001 |work=CMT.com}}{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> \"That's a Plan\" was eventually released as the second single, followed by \"She Doesn't Dance\".
