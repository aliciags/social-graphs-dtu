Judd'''. Known primarily for his parodies of popular country songs, he has been called the [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] of country music, and his albums are usually an equal mix of original comedy songs and parodies. Judd has released 11 studio albums and two EPs, and several singles have entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. His chart peak is the number-48 \"I Love NASCAR\", a parody of [[Toby Keith]]'s 2003 single \"[[I Love This Bar]]\".\n\n==Musical career==\nJudd moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to pursue a career in country music. By 1993, he was living in a house with [[Daron Norwood]] and preparing to move back home until he wrote a parody of \"[[Indian Outlaw]]\" by [[Tim McGraw]], which made him decide to pursue a career as a parodist.<ref name=\"stark\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/legal-and-management/6443453/cledus-t-judd-on-his-decision-to-bow-out-of-the-music|title=Cledus T.

Judd released his debut album, ''[[Cledus T. Judd (No Relation)]]'', on [[Razor & Tie Records]] in 1995, the \"(No Relation)\" part of the title being a reference to [[Wynonna Judd|Wynonna]] and [[Naomi Judd]].<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p144284/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Cledus T. Judd biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=January 9, 2009}}</ref> Two non-country parodies were also included on this album: one of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' \"[[Hotel California]]\", and one of \"[[We Are the World]]\", a 1980s charity single credited to [[USA for Africa]]. Judd's parody, entitled \"We Own the World\", satirized the marriage of [[Lisa Marie Presley]] and [[Michael Jackson]].\n\n''[[I Stoled This Record]]'' followed in 1996. This album, despite not producing a chart single, earned [[RIAA]] gold certification for shipping 500,000 copies. This album included parodies of two [[Shania Twain]] songs: \"[[(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!]]\" became \"(I'm Not in Here for Love) Just a Beer\" and \"[[Any Man of Mine]]\" became \"If Shania Was Mine\". [[John Michael Montgomery]]'s \"[[Sold (The Grundy County Auction Incident)]]\" was also parodied twice on this album.\n\nHis third album, ''[[Did I Shave My Back for This?]]'' (a take-off on [[Deana Carter]]'s ''[[Did I Shave My Legs for This?]]''), included his first duet, with [[Buck Owens]] on the original track \"First Redneck on the Internet\". The album also parodied [[Alan Jackson]], [[Joe Diffie]], [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[Mindy McCready]], and [[Trace Adkins]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n1998's ''[[Juddmental]]'' was his final album for Razor & Tie. It included a duet, this time with [[Daryle Singletary]] on \"Ricky Tidwell's Momma's Gonna Play Football\", a non-parody song previously recorded by [[Tim Wilson (comedian)|Tim Wilson]]. This album once again parodied a Twain song, with her \"[[Honey, I'm Home]]\" becoming \"Shania, I'm Broke\". The [[Garth Brooks]]/[[Trisha Yearwood]] duet \"[[In Another's Eyes]]\" was also parodied on this compilation. It was originally to have been on Judd's previous album, but Brooks had initially expressed concern over a parody compromising the song's chances at winning a [[Grammy Award]].<ref name=\"countrymailbag.com\"/>\n\n===2000\u20132005===\nAfter leaving Razor & Tie Records, Judd signed to [[Monument Records]] Nashville in 2000 to release his fifth album, ''[[Just Another Day in Parodies]]''. This album produced his first chart single in \"My Cellmate Thinks I'm Sexy\", a parody of [[Kenny Chesney]]'s 1999 single \"[[She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy]]\" which referenced Chesney's and McGraw's 2000 arrest for stealing a Mounted Reserve officer's horse. The parody charted at No.&nbsp;61 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]). Following this song was another chart single, \"How Do You Milk a Cow\" (based on [[Toby Keith]]'s \"[[How Do You Like Me Now?! (song)|How Do You Like Me Now?!]]\"), which peaked at No.&nbsp;67; the music video also features Toby Keith. In 2002, he released ''[[Cledus Envy]]'', followed later that year by a Christmas album entitled ''[[Cledus Navidad]]''. At the end of the year, Judd also made an appearance in the music video for Keith's \"[[Who's Your Daddy? (Toby Keith song)|Who's Your Daddy?]]\".\n\nHis last release for Monument was a six-song [[extended play|EP]] called ''[[A Six Pack of Judd]]'', released in 2003. After Monument closed its Nashville division, he signed to [[Koch Records]] Nashville to release a second EP, the four-song ''[[The Original Dixie Hick]]'', later in 2003. This release, which contained parodies pertaining to the [[Dixie Chicks]], also produced his third chart single in \"Martie, Natalie and Emily (The Continuing Saga Of)\", a parody of [[Brad Paisley]]'s \"[[Celebrity (Brad Paisley song)|Celebrity]]\".\n\nJudd's final release for Koch was 2004's ''[[Bipolar and Proud]]''. This album produced two more chart singles for him, including his highest-peaking, the No.&nbsp;48 \"I Love NASCAR\", which parodied Keith's \"[[I Love This Bar]]\" and included guest vocals from Keith himself. Following this song was the No.&nbsp;58 \"Bake Me A Country Ham\", based on [[Tracy Lawrence]]'s \"[[Paint Me a Birmingham]]\".\n\n===2006\u20132014 ===\nBy mid-2005, Judd had announced plans to release a tribute album to [[Ray Stevens]] entitled ''[[Boogity, Boogity - A Tribute to the Comedic Genius of Ray Stevens]]'', containing [[cover song|covers]] of Stevens's material with several guest vocalists. Due to the closure of Koch's Nashville division, however, this album was delayed until 2007, when Judd signed to [[Asylum-Curb Records]] and released it in August. Shortly before its release, he made his sixth chart appearance with the non-album song \"Illegals\".\n\nJudd re-signed to Koch in 2009, after the label was renamed E1 Music. In January of that year, he released the single \"Waitin' on Obama\" (a parody of Brad Paisley's \"[[Waitin' on a Woman]]\") referencing [[Barack Obama]]'s election as President of the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.cmt.com/2009-01-08/cledus-t-judd-counts-the-days-waitin-on-obama/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090116111904/http://blog.cmt.com/2009-01-08/cledus-t-judd-counts-the-days-waitin-on-obama/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 16, 2009|title=Cledus T.

She made her debut in March 2004 with the [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]]-winning single \"[[Redneck Woman]]\", a number-one hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. The song served as the lead-off single of her debut album, ''[[Here for the Party]]''. Wilson followed this album one year later with ''[[All Jacked Up]]'', the title track of which became the highest-debuting single for a female country artist upon its 2005 release. A third album, ''[[One of the Boys (Gretchen Wilson album)|One of the Boys]]'', was released in 2007.\n\nOverall, Wilson has charted 13 singles on the ''Billboard'' country charts, of which five have reached top ten: the number one \"Redneck Woman\", as well as \"[[Here for the Party (song)|Here for the Party]]\" (#3, 2004), \"When I Think About Cheatin'\" (#4, 2004), \"Homewrecker\" (#2, 2005), and \"[[All Jacked Up (song)|All Jacked Up]]\" (#8, 2005). The album ''Here for the Party'' was certified 5\u00d7 multi-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for sales of five million copies, while ''All Jacked Up'' was certified platinum. She has sold over 8.2 million records worldwide.\n\n==Country music career==\n===''Here for the Party''===\n[[File:Gwnp.jpg|thumb|right|Wilson performing in a concert]]\nWilson signed with [[Epic Records]] in 2003 and recorded ''[[Here for the Party]]'' within the year. Her first single, \"[[Redneck Woman]]\", was released in early 2004 and reached the top of the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and No.&nbsp;22 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This song was also the first number one country hit by a female in two years.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p657188/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Gretchen Wilson biography|access-date=October 6, 2008|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|work=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The success of \"Redneck Woman\" prompted an earlier-than-planned release for ''Here for the Party'', and it debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' country chart. It reached No.&nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and ''Billboard'' Internet album sales charts. She performed as a support artist for [[Brooks & Dunn]] and [[Montgomery Gentry]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\nShe released the title track to her debut album as the second single. It peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' country chart. Two other songs were released as singles, and both reached the top 10. Released in markets outside the U.S., the album hit No.&nbsp;2 on the Australian country charts (behind [[Kasey Chambers]]) and the top 50 of the Australian charts. ''Here for the Party'' was certified 5\u00d7 multi-platinum by the RIAA.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n===''All Jacked Up''===\nOn September 27, 2005, Wilson released her second album, ''[[All Jacked Up]]'',<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on both the Top 200 and Country album charts and sold 1 million copies. The title track debuted at No.&nbsp;21 on the Hot Country Songs charts, setting a record for the highest debut ever made by a female artist.\n\nThis record was broken in late 2007 by [[Carrie Underwood]]'s \"[[So Small]]\". Despite its high debut, however, \"All Jacked Up\" peaked at No.&nbsp;8 on Hot Country Songs after only eight chart weeks. It was also used, at one time, by [[ESPN]] as the opening theme for its baseball coverage.  Three more singles were released from ''All Jacked Up'': \"I Don't Feel Like Loving You Today\", \"Politically Uncorrect\" (a duet with [[Merle Haggard]]) and \"California Girls\", none of which reached Top 20 on the country charts. These latter two singles were issued on [[Columbia Records]], due to the closure of Epic Records's Nashville division.\n\nWilson's \"I Don't Feel Like Loving You Today\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, and Best Country Song. In 2006, Wilson contributed a well-received cover of [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s \"Sunday Mornin' Coming Down\" on the tribute CD ''The Pilgrim: A Celebration of Kris Kristofferson''.\n\n===''One of the Boys''===\n{{BLP unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}\nOn May 15, 2007, Wilson released her third album, ''[[One of the Boys (Gretchen Wilson album)|One of the Boys]]''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;5 on the Top 200 and at No.&nbsp;1 on the Country album chart. After 10 weeks, it exited the Billboard Top 200, having sold 178,220 copies at that point. \"Come to Bed\" (a duet with John Rich) and the title track, the first two singles released, both peaked in the 30s on the country charts, while the third and final single (\"You Don't Have to Go Home\") failed to reach the Top 40.\n\n===''I Got Your Country Right Here''===\nOn July 14, 2008, Wilson released a new single, \"Don't Do Me No Good\". This song was intended to be the lead-off single to a fourth studio album, but it failed to reach the Top 40 and the album was delayed. It was followed in 2009 by two more singles, \"The Earrings Song\" and \"If I Could Do It All Again,\" neither of which entered the charts. Wilson then issued a press release on July 28, 2009, stating that she would be parting with Sony Music Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1617125/gretchen-wilson-sony-music-part-ways.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731231724/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1617125/gretchen-wilson-sony-music-part-ways.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 31, 2009|title=Gretchen Wilson, Sony Music part ways|date=July 28, 2009|work=CMT|access-date=July 28, 2009}}</ref> Wilson then launched Redneck Records, her own record label. \"[[Work Hard, Play Harder]]\" was released to radio on October 26, 2009, as the first single from the label and her fourth studio album, ''[[I Got Your Country Right Here]]'', was finally released on March 30, 2010.

A second album for Mercury, ''[[Men & Mascara]]'', followed in 2006. This album produced two non-charting singles in its title track and a cover of [[Saving Jane]]'s \"[[Girl Next Door (Saving Jane song)|Girl Next Door]]\".\n\nIn 2013, she took part in the Blind Auditions of [[The Voice (U.S. season 4)|fourth season]] of the reality television show ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]]'' but failed to qualify. Her comeback album ''Good Wine & Bad Decision'' charted on both US Country Albums chart and the US [[Independent Albums|Indie Albums]] charts.\n\nRoberts has [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/2014/05/28/health/julie-roberts-human-factor/index.html|title=Living with MS, 'I do not have to give up on my dreams'|author=Julie Roberts, Special to|website=CNN|date=May 28, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nJulie Roberts was born in [[Lancaster, South Carolina]], United States, in 1979. The daughter of an engineer and accountant, she began her life performing in [[pre-school]] plays. She also was in school choirs and performed in a rendition of \"My Fair Lady\" at a singing summer camp. Roberts began performing country music as a child. When she was in junior high and high school, she toured with her family, playing at festivals in [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. She also performed at area nursing homes (where she developed an appreciation for [[blues music]]); and worked at [[Carowinds]] (a theme park in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]) and [[Dollywood]]. She also worked with 60- and 70-year-old men performing at nursing homes. Her influences include [[Dolly Parton]], [[Barbara Mandrell]] and [[Tanya Tucker]].\n\nShe first attended [[University of South Carolina Lancaster|USC Lancaster]] in her hometown from 1997 to 1999 before graduating from [[Belmont University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], with a degree in business administration. Roberts performed in local clubs and restaurants until graduation, she began working for [[Mercury Nashville Records]], later becoming assistant to label head Luke Lewis. During her tenure there, she recorded a demo tape with producer Brent Rowan during her off-time. Rowan eventually played the tape for Lewis, who was favorably impressed by the recording.\n\n===Country music career===\nRoberts was signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville]]'s Mercury Nashville division. Her debut single, \"[[Break Down Here]]\", was released on February 24, 2004. The song had previously been recorded by [[Trace Adkins]] under the title \"I'd Sure Hate to Break Down Here\". Roberts released her self-titled [[Julie Roberts (album)|debut album]] on May 25, 2004. It charted within the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart, peaking at No.&nbsp;9. \"Break Down Here\" became a Top 20 single on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, however, she never charted within the Top 40 after that. The two follow-up singles, \"The Chance\" and \"Wake Up Older\", peaked at No.&nbsp;47 and No.&nbsp;46 on the country charts, respectively. The album was then certified Gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] on December 13, 2004.\n\nIn 2006, she released her fourth single, \"Men & Mascara\", which would in-turn be the title track to her second album. ''[[Men & Mascara]]'' was released on June 27, 2006. Although not charting a single from this album, it managed to chart even higher than her debut album. It reached No.&nbsp;4 on the Top Country Albums and No.&nbsp;25 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Included on the album is a [[cover version]] of [[Saving Jane]]'s \"[[Girl Next Door (Saving Jane song)|Girl Next Door]]\", however, it failed to chart along with the album's title track.\n\nRoberts and Mercury Records parted ways at the beginning of May 2010. She released her third album \"Alive\" on June 7 as an independent artist, with the first single being \"NASCAR Party\".\n\nIn 2011, Roberts revealed that she was diagnosed with [[multiple sclerosis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/julie-roberts-multiple-sclerosis/|title=Julie Roberts Combats M.S.

After several years of performing throughout Texas, the quartet released an independent album in 1994; this album was later picked up by [[Curb Records]], who re-packaged and re-released it a year later. By 1995, its second single (entitled \"[[You Have the Right to Remain Silent (song)|You Have the Right to Remain Silent]]\") had become a Top 5 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts.\n\nAlthough Perfect Stranger never entered Top 40 on the country charts again, the band continued to perform and record throughout the 1990s, charting several more singles before eventually exiting Curb in the late 1990s. In addition, Andy Ginn was replaced by Marty Arbter on drums. Perfect Stranger returned to Curb to release its second album, ''The Hits'', in 2001, and was dropped again afterward. As of 2009, the band is composed of co-lead singers/guitarists Marcus Eldridge and Clint Williams, bassist Shayne Morrison, lead guitarist Chad Ware, and drummer Doug Martin. A third album, ''Shake the World'', was released in 2009. Morrison briefly re-established the band in 2010 with Murray, Raines, and new drummer Scott Zucknick.\n\n==Biography==\nPerfect Stranger was founded in 1986 in [[Carthage, Texas]], by Steve Murray (lead vocals), Shayne Morrison (bass guitar), Richard Raines (lead guitar), and Andy Ginn (drums).<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p146793/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Perfect Stranger biography |accessdate=2008-01-07 |last=Loftus |first=Johnny |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> They originally performed as Midnight Express before assuming the name Perfect Stranger.<ref name=\"oldies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Perfect-Stranger.html |title=Perfect Stranger biography |accessdate=2008-01-07 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref> The four artists played together throughout the state of Texas, mostly in clubs and at rodeos. In December 1994, they released an independent album on the Pacific label, entitled ''It's Up to You''. Featured on it was the single \"Ridin' the Rodeo\". Written by [[Vince Gill]] and [[Kostas Lazarides|Kostas]],<ref name=\"talent\"/> the song was considered the biggest independent country music hit in the United States at the time, although it never reached the ''Billboard'' charts.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nA second single, entitled \"[[You Have the Right to Remain Silent (song)|You Have the Right to Remain Silent]]\", followed soon afterward. By the time of its release, Perfect Stranger's success as an independent act had been noticed by [[Curb Records]], who acquired the band's debut album and its single. Curb continued promoting \"You Have the Right to Remain Silent\".<ref name=\"talent\">{{cite web |url=http://www.gatalent.com/Acts/Perfect_Stranger/perfect_stranger.html |title=Perfect Stranger |accessdate=2008-01-07 |work=GA Talent}}</ref> ''It's Up to You'' was then re-packaged and re-released in 1995 as ''You Have the Right to Remain Silent'', the band's major-label debut. By the middle of the year, its title track had reached No.&nbsp;4 on the country music charts, and No.&nbsp;61 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nThey were nominated in 1996 at the [[31st Academy of Country Music Awards]] for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Vocal Duo or Group of the Year|Best New Vocal Duo or Group of the Year]], along with [[4 Runner]] and [[Lonestar]], losing to the latter group. \n\nThroughout the 1990s and into the 2000s, Perfect Stranger continued to chart singles on occasion, although none of their other singles entered Top 40 on the country music charts.

Alexander and Buford were recovering alcoholics and drug addicts, and while it is a common misconception they met at a rehab facility, the trio did not meet within rehabilitation. Early on, they released their first album ''[[To Whom It May Consume]]'' produced by Campbell and Buford.\n\n===2000\u20132002: Departure of Steaknife, and ''Southern Discomfort''===\nSoon after ''To Whom It May Consume'', Campbell was incarcerated and Epic/Sony offered a record deal to Buford and Alexander as a duo. Mashing rap with rock, the duo released their major label debut album, ''[[Southern Discomfort (Rehab album)|Southern Discomfort]],'' in 2000 on the Sony label. Cee-Lo & Bigg Gipp of Goodie Mob, Mandy Lauderdale and Cody ChesnuTT were the guests on the album, which spawned the Top 15 modern rock hit \"It Don't Matter\", and \"Sittin' At A Bar\".\n\nTwo years were spent on the road supporting the album touring with Kottonmouth Kings and the Phunk Junkeez, including a stint on the Warped Tour.\n\n===2002\u20132004: ''Cuz We Can'', departure of Buford, and hiatus===\nFor reasons not publicly clarified, Buford left the band, and released 26 unreleased Rehab songs on his website towards the end of his tenure. This collection was later known to fans as ''Cuz We Can''. 22 of the 26 songs were produced by Denny \"Steaknife\" Campbell, and the album was later given out to on tours by Boone in 2007. Boone also modified the track list of the pressed version, removing certain songs and adding new ones, in light of Buford's departure.\n\nAfter two years on the road supporting the Vans Warped Tour and playing with bands such as Linkin Park, the group went on an indefinite hiatus. Buford did not return to the group, however, later appeared as host of 2005's ''[[List of programs broadcast by MTV|Trailer Fabulous]]'' on MTV and recorded a single for the show's theme, before joining the short-lived project The Audio Club with [[Tommy Henriksen|Tommy Hendriksen]].<ref name=\"Biography\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/rehab-p416355/biography|title=Rehab > Biography|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation|Macrovision]]|access-date=2011-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Lang |first=Derrik J. |title=MTV show \\'Trailer Fabulous\\' tricks out mobile homes |url=https://www.heraldtimesonline.com/story/news/2005/08/05/mtv-show-trailer-fabulous-tricks-out-mobile-homes/48285067/ |access-date=2024-02-12 |website=The Herald-Times |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Writer |first=Derrik J.

WIth Houchins, a new band was assembled consisting of guitarist Mike Hartnett, Hano Leathers, Chris Hood and [[Foz]]. Now a quintet with Alexander, Rehab signed with Arshid Entertainment and released ''[[Graffiti the World]]'' in 2005.\n\nSometime in 2008, the three original members decided to do a reunion [[Extended Play|EP]] and go by the name Southern Discomfort. Their label saw this and decided to halt most of the promotion, since the name of Southern Discomfort was essentially owned by Epic/Sony. As a result, the label released ''Sitting at a Bar,'' which was a [[Reissue|re-release]] of their debut album. All of this was done without the band's permission.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rehab Discography|date=14 October 2008|url=http://rehab-world.blogspot.com/2008/10/rehab-discography.html|publisher=Nate|access-date=23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nTo fight this unauthorized reissue, the band re-recorded the single and renamed it \"Bartender Song.\" This version would end up on a 2008 version of ''[[Graffiti the World]]'' released by the major label, Universal. Rehab stuck with Universal for their 2010 album ''[[Welcome Home (Rehab Album)|Welcome Home]],'' which saw a handful of singles on the Top 30 video countdown for CMT through January 2011.\n\n===2011\u20132014: ''Gullible's Travels'' and breakup===\n''[[Gullible's Travels (Rehab Album)|Gullible's Travels]]'' was released on February 21, 2012 through AVJ Records (a subsidiary label of [[Average Joe's Entertainment]]) owned by former Rehab producer and manager Shannon Houchins and country music artist [[Colt Ford]]. Touring followed with the single \"Waho by the Hoti\" (\"the Waffle House by the hotel\"). The video for their single \"King of Tweakers\", which was released on their website in the summer of 2011, premiered on February 21, 2012 with the album release.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rehab About|url=http://www.rehabmusic.com/about|publisher=Rehab|access-date=26 March 2012}}</ref> A video for the next single \"Can't Catch Up To You\" was also recorded.\n\nOn July 3, 2013, a track by [[Twiztid]] was released off their first mixtape [[A New Nightmare]] entitled \"Unjust love\", featuring Danny Alexander.\n\nThe band released a 2013 single \"Whore\" which would be the last recorded content by the band. In 2014, the band released a statement to their fans that they would be going on a farewell tour and disband to form solo careers. Before the break, the band recorded a full album titled ''Million Dollar Mugshot,'' which [[Average Joes Entertainment]] did not release until 2017.\n\n===2015\u20132016: Possible reformation===\nSometime in June 2015, former founding member Denny Campbell posted on his Facebook page that said there was a possible Rehab reunion between Alexander and himself. He continued to post pictures of him and Boone in the studio as well. On March 19, 2016, a possible album cover was posted on Rehab's website. On September 1, 2017, ''Million Dollar Mug Shot'' was finally released.\n\n===2017\u2013present: Reformation===\nOn December 31, 2017, Alexander announced via video on the official Rehab Facebook page<ref>https://www.facebook.com/rehabmusic/videos/10159759494615076/ {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref> that Rehab had returned. In the video, he stated there would be new music and tour in 2018. He also stated that the band lineup is now Danny Boone and Jericho,<ref>https://www.facebook.com/jay.j.robinson.10 {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref> in addition to a full band.\n\nOn April 12, 2019, the studio album titled ''Galaga'' was released. This is the first album released independently with the help of ONErpm. Full tours in 2019 and 2020 followed. The tour included a band but with a different lineup as prior iteration as seen below.\n\n==Band members==\n[[Image:Chrishood.JPG|thumb|Chris Hood]]\n[[Image:Dannyboone.JPG|thumb|Danny Boone Alexander]]\n[[Image:Demonjonesrehab.JPG|thumb|Demun Jones on the left]]\n[[Image:Fozrehab.JPG|thumb|Foz]]\n[[Image:Hano Leathers.jpg|thumb|Hano Leathers]]\n[[Image:Mikehartnett.JPG|thumb|Mike Hartnett]]\n[[Image:Steakniferehab.JPG|thumb|Steaknife on the right]]\n\n'''Current lineup'''\n*Danny \"Boone\" Alexander (vocals)\n*Doyle Williams (lead guitar)\n*Nate Lee (bass)\n*Ian Corabi (drums)\n\n<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.rehabtheband.com/about | title=About }}</ref>\n'''Former members'''\n*Jason Brooks 'Buford' (vocals)\n*Lamar Williams Jr. (vocals)\n*Hano Leathers (bass)\n*Fazal \"Foz\" Syed (guitar) \n*Mike Hartnett (guitar)\n*Demun Jones (vocals)\n*DJ Chris Crisis (turntables)\n*Chris Hood (drums)\n*Doyle Williams (guitar)\n*Jay \"Jericho\" Robinson (vocals)\n*Caleb Melvin (Drummer)\n*Taylor Robins (guitar)\n*Denny Campbell (Steaknife) (vocals)\n*Brandon Dover (bass)\n*DJ Uh Oh (turntables)\n*Joey Malik (guitar)\n\n\n\n'''Timeline'''\n<div class=\"left\">\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:1000 height:200\nPlotArea = left:100 bottom:60 top:0 right:50\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1998 till:{{#time:m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\n\nColors =\n id:Vocals value:red legend:Vocals\n id:Rapping value:purple legend: Rap_Vocals\n id:Guitar value:green legend:Guitars\n id:Rhythm value:magenta legend:Rhythm_guitar \n id:Bass value:blue legend:Bass_guitar\n id:Drums value:orange legend:Drums\n id:DJ value:yellow legend:DJ\n id:Lines value:black legend:Studio_albums\n id:Lines1 value:gray(0.6) legend:Mix_Albums\n id:bars value:gray(0.93)\n\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\nBackgroundColors = bars:bars\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1998\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1999\n\nLineData =\n at:01/01/1999 color:black layer:back\n at:10/24/2000 color:black layer:back\n at:01/01/2002 color:black layer:back\n at:05/15/2005 color:black layer:back\n at:05/27/2008 color:black layer:back\n at:01/01/2010 color:Lines1 layer:back\n at:09/07/2010 color:black layer:back\n at:02/21/2012 color:black layer:back\n at:06/01/2012 color:Lines1 layer:back\n\nBarData = \n bar:Boone text:\"Danny Alexander\"\n bar:Buford text:\"Jason Brooks\"\n bar:Steaknife text:\"Denny Campbell\"\n bar:Hood text:\"Chris Hood\" \n bar:Lamar text:\"Lamar Williams Jr.\"\n bar:Leathers text:\"Hano Leathers\"\n bar:Harnett text:\"Mike Hartnett\"\n bar:Syed text:\"Fazal Syed\"\n bar:Jones text:\"Demun Jones\"\n bar:Crisis text:\"DJ Chris Crisis\"\n bar:Jericho text:\"Jay Robinson\"\n\nPlotData=\n width:10 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(10,-4)\n bar:Boone from:01/01/1998 till:05/01/2002 color:Vocals\n bar:Boone from:01/01/1998 till:05/01/2002 color:Rapping width: 2.5\n bar:Boone from:01/01/2005 till:01/01/2014 color:Vocals\n bar:Boone from:01/01/2005 till:01/01/2014 color:Rapping width: 2.5\n bar:Boone from:12/31/2017 till:end color:Vocals\n bar:Boone from:12/31/2017 till:end color:Rapping width: 2.5\n bar:Buford from:01/01/1998 till:05/01/2002 color:Rapping \n bar:Steaknife from:01/01/1998 till:01/01/1999 color:Rapping\n bar:Steaknife from:01/01/2008 till:01/01/2009 color:Rapping\n bar:Hood from:01/01/2005 till:01/01/2014 color:Drums\n bar:Lamar from:01/01/2010 till:01/01/2014 color:Rapping\n bar:Leathers from:01/01/2005 till:08/19/2011 color:Bass \n bar:Syed from:01/01/2005 till:08/19/2011 color:Rhythm\n bar:Harnett from:01/01/2005 till:08/19/2011 color:Guitar \n bar:Harnett from:01/01/2005 till:08/19/2011 color:Vocals width: 2.5\n bar:Jones from:01/01/2006 till:01/01/2014 color:Rapping\n bar:Crisis from:01/01/2006 till:01/01/2014 color:DJ\n bar:Jericho from:12/31/2017 till:01/01/2022:Rapping\n\n}}\n</div>\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n====Studio albums====\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ List of studio albums, with selected chart positions\n!

After establishing himself in the [[Music of Detroit#Hip hop|Detroit hip hop]] scene, he broke through into mainstream success with a [[rap rock]] sound before shifting his performance style to [[country rock]]. A self-taught musician, he has said he can play every instrument in his backing band and has overseen production on all but two of his albums.\n\nKid Rock started his music career as a rapper and DJ, releasing his debut album ''[[Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast]]'' (1990), on [[Jive Records]]. His subsequent independent releases ''[[The Polyfuze Method]]'' (1993) and ''[[Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp]]'' (1996) saw him developing a more distinctive style, which was fully realized on his breakthrough album ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'' (1998), which sold 14 million copies. This album and its follow-up, ''[[Cocky (album)|Cocky]]'' (2001), were noted for blending elements of hip-hop, country and rock.\n\nHis most successful single from that time period, \"[[Cowboy (Kid Rock song)|Cowboy]]\" (1999), is considered a pioneering song in the [[country rap]] genre.

He explained in a 2000 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, \"I've got a lot of faith in people. Whether it's some kid with a trust fund that people tease because he's got a trust fund, you know.

Signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] Nashville in 1999, Worley released four albums for the label: ''[[Hard Rain Don't Last]]'' (2000), ''[[I Miss My Friend]]'' (2002), ''[[Have You Forgotten? (album)|Have You Forgotten?]]'' (2003), and ''[[Darryl Worley (album)|Darryl Worley]]'' in 2004. After the label closed in 2005, he moved to 903 Music, an independent label owned by [[Neal McCoy]], releasing ''[[Here and Now (Darryl Worley album)|Here and Now]]'' in 2006, shortly before that label's closure. His most recent studio release is 2009's ''[[Sounds Like Life]]'' via [[Stroudavarious Records]], owned by [[James Stroud]].\n\nWorley's six albums have produced 18 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including three number ones: \"[[I Miss My Friend (song)|I Miss My Friend]]\", \"[[Have You Forgotten?]]\", and \"[[Awful, Beautiful Life]]\", from 2002, 2003 and 2004\u20132005, respectively. \"Have You Forgotten?\" spent seven weeks at number one. Nine other singles have reached the top 40.\n\n==Biography==\nDarryl Wade Worley was born October 31, 1964, in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to Tommy and Bonnie Worley. His family moved to [[Pyburn, Tennessee]], when he was young and he was raised there. His father was a Methodist preacher and his mother sang in the church choir.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p337247/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Darryl Worley biography|last=Phares|first=Heather|work=Allmusic|access-date=February 4, 2009}}</ref> Worley attended the [[University of North Alabama]] and earned a degree in biology and chemistry. He worked in the chemical industry prior to pursuing country music, and wrote for [[FAME Studios]] in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]]. One of his first cuts as a songwriter was a track on [[Archer/Park]]'s 1994 debut album.\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===Hard Rain Don't Last (1999\u20132001)===\nWorley was signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] in 1999. His debut single \"[[When You Need My Love]]\" followed in March 2000, the first of four single releases from his debut album ''[[Hard Rain Don't Last]]''. Following this song were \"[[A Good Day to Run]]\", \"Second Wind\" and \"Sideways\". Respectively, these singles peaked at No.&nbsp;15, No.&nbsp;12, No.&nbsp;20 and No.&nbsp;41 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. Production duties on the album were split between [[Frank Rogers (record producer)|Frank Rogers]] and [[James Stroud]]. Also in 2000, [[George Jones]] charted with the single \"Sinners & Saints\", which Worley co-wrote.\n\n===I Miss My Friend (2002)===\nHis second album, ''[[I Miss My Friend]]'' became his first Number One hit on the country charts that year, and was followed by the top 30 \"Family Tree\", written by [[Darrell & Scott]]. This album was also his first Number One album on [[Top Country Albums]].\n\n===Have You Forgotten? (2003)===\nWorley had his biggest hit in 2003 with the [[9/11]] tribute ballad \"[[Have You Forgotten?]]\", the first release from his 2003 compilation album of the [[Have You Forgotten? (album)|same name]]. It reached Number One in its fifth week on the charts, and held its position for seven weeks. The album included only four new tracks counting \"Have You Forgotten?\", as well as six each from his first and second albums. \"Tennessee River Run\", one of the carryovers from ''I Miss My Friend'', was issued as a single in 2003, peaking at No.&nbsp;31. After it came his lowest-peaking single, \"I Will Hold My Ground\" at No.&nbsp;57. ''Have You Forgotten?'' is also certified [[gold album|gold]] by the [[RIAA]].\n\n===Darryl Worley (2004\u20132005)===\n2004 saw the release of Worley's third studio album, the self-titled ''[[Darryl Worley (album)|Darryl Worley]]''. Its lead-off single, the [[Harley Allen]] co-write \"[[Awful, Beautiful Life]]\", became his third Number One hit in early 2005. Following this song was the Top Ten \"If Something Should Happen\", as well as \"I Love Her, She Hates Me\", which stopped at No.&nbsp;56 due to the closure of DreamWorks Records in mid-2005.\n\n===Here and Now (2006\u20132007)===\nLater that same year,  Worley signed with country singer [[Neal McCoy]]'s vanity label 903 Music. His first release for 903 was \"Nothin' but a Love Thang\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;35. This was the first of three singles from ''[[Here and Now (Darryl Worley album)|Here and Now]]'', his fourth studio album. Also released from it were the Top 20 \"[[I Just Came Back from a War]]\" and the No.&nbsp;54 \"Livin' in the Here and Now\", the chart run of which was halted by the closure of 903 music in May 2007.<ref>[http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i6aa5bb36869cfa84fd7b70898175ddec McCoy's 903 Music To Shut Down<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n===Sounds Like Life (2008\u20132010)===\nWorley signed in 2008 to his third recording contract, this time with [[Stroudavarious Records]], a label that Stroud founded in 2008. His sixteenth chart entry, \"Tequila on Ice\", was issued in the middle of that year, peaking at No.&nbsp;44. Following it was \"Sounds Like Life to Me\", which has reached the Top 20. Both songs are included on his fifth release, ''[[Sounds Like Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countrystandardtime.com/news/newsitem.asp?xid=2670|title=Sounds like a new CD for Darryl Worley|date=March 6, 2009|work=[[Country Standard Time]]|access-date=May 4, 2009}}</ref> The album's third and final single was \"Best of Both Worlds.\"\n\n=== God & Country ===\nWorley debuted the single \"Keep the Change\" in mid-2010. It was to be included on his sixth studio album, ''God & Country'', but the album went unreleased when his record label, Stroudavarious, ceased operation.\n\nWorley then moved to Tenacity Records in 2012 to release \"You Still Got It\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/independent-lens-darryl-worley-s-tenacity-proves-he-s-still-got-it |title=Independent Lens: Darryl Worley's Tenacity proves He's \"Still Got It\" &#124; New Country Music, Listen to Songs & Video &#124; Roughstock.com |access-date=April 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401233926/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/independent-lens-darryl-worley-s-tenacity-proves-he-s-still-got-it |archive-date=April 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Image:Darryl Worley at Pentagon 2003.jpg|thumb|Darryl Worley performing for the troops at the Pentagon, April 2003]]\nWorley married his first wife, Beverly Irwin, on May 12, 2001; they divorced in July 2006.

He signed to [[Virgin Records]]' Nashville division in late 1999. Davidson released his debut album ''[[Unconditional (Clay Davidson album)|Unconditional]]'' on April 11, 2000. Its title track was a top 5 hit for him on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, and the album produced two more Top 30 hits. Davidson was later transferred to [[Capitol Records]] Nashville after Virgin Nashville's lineup was merged into Capitol, although he did not record anything for Capitol and was soon dropped.

On February 4, 2014, the album, ''Early Morning Shakes'', was released and received mostly positive reviews. In September 2016, their fourth album ''Mud'' was released. The band's self-titled album was released on September 27, 2019 followed by \"Tornillo\" in July 29, 2022.\n\nThe band started when friends Cody Cannon and John Jeffers began learning guitar together, inspired by the music of [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]], [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Waylon Jennings]], amongst many other artists. After being joined by Cannon's co-worker and friend Cody Tate. After playing together for a while, the three decided to start a more serious band. They enlisted friend Jeff Hogg to play drums, and asked Cannon's cousin Gary Brown to play bass (although he did not know how to play the instrument at the time). They began playing shows around their hometown and native state of Texas, slowly starting to build a following on the Texas/Red Dirt scene.\n\nIn 2018, the band was featured in four episodes of the [[Kevin Costner]] [[Paramount Network]] series [[Yellowstone (American TV series)|''Yellowstone'']]. Shortly afterwards, the band's three available albums moved into the top 10 iTunes country chart. Their most recent album at the time, ''Mud'', reached No. 1 on the charts, and its song \"Stone\" reached No. 9 in all genres. \n\nOn September 27, 2019, the band released the self-titled album, ''[[Whiskey Myers (album)|Whiskey Myers]]''.

Uniquely for a country music song it also became an international success, reaching number 1 in Australia and number 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Thanks to the video of this hit, there was the explosion of the [[line dance]] into the mainstream, becoming a global craze.<ref name=\"OutOfStyle\">{{cite news|date=October 30, 1992|title=Line dancing refuses to go out of style|newspaper=Star-News|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=iqssAAAAIBAJ&pg=2782,6165269&dq=billy+ray+cyrus+line+dancing&hl=en|access-date=August 12, 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Additionally, the singles \"[[Could've Been Me]]\" reached No. 2, \"Wher'm I Gonna Live?\" reached No. 23, and \"[[She's Not Cryin' Anymore]]\" reached No. 6.

The album featured four singles, three of which made the top 40. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the Country charts, and No.&nbsp;3 on the ''Billboard'' 200. By the end of the year, ''It Won't Be the Last'' was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. The highest-charting single, the lead-off single, \"[[In the Heart of a Woman]]\", charted to No. 3, with \"[[Somebody New (Billy Ray Cyrus song)|Somebody New]]\" charting to No. 9, \"Words By Heart\" at No. 12, and \"Talk Some\" at No. 63. Also in 1993, Cyrus appeared on [[Dolly Parton]]'s single \"[[Slow Dancing with the Moon|Romeo]]\"; though the single only reached 27 on the country singles charts, the accompanying video was popular on [[Country Music Television|CMT]].\n\nCyrus' third studio album, ''[[Storm in the Heartland]]'', was released in 1994. It was the final album he recorded for PolyGram, which closed its doors in 1995. The album was not as successful as its predecessors. It only reached No. 11 on the Country albums chart, and only the title track made the top 40 of the Country singles chart. \"Deja Blue\" was the second single released; however, it only managed to chart to No. 66, and the third and final single, \"One Last Thrill\", failed to chart at all.\n\nThe album managed to be certified gold in the U.S. Before Cyrus started on his next album, he was transferred to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Mercury Nashville]].\n\nAlso in 1994, Cyrus contributed the song \"Pictures Don't Lie\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album [[Red Hot + Country]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nCyrus' most critically acclaimed album was 1996's ''[[Trail of Tears (Billy Ray Cyrus album)|Trail of Tears]]'' for Mercury Records. The album debuted at No. 20 on the Country chart. Only two songs made the cut to radio, neither of which hit the top 40. The title track and \"Three Little Words\" reached No. 69 and No. 65 respectively. The album failed to reach any certification, and was off the charts after only four weeks.\n\nIn 1998, Cyrus released his last album for Mercury Records ''[[Shot Full of Love]]''. The album became his lowest-peaking album, debuting at No. 32. The first single, \"Under the Hood\", failed to chart, \"Time for Letting Go\" hit No. 70, \"[[Busy Man]]\" charted No. 3, and \"I Give My Heart to You\" reached No. 41. After the single fell from the charts, Cyrus left Mercury and signed with [[Monument Records]] in 1999.\n\nHis debut album for Monument, ''[[Southern Rain]]'', was released in 2000. It debuted at No. 13 on the Country albums chart and No. 102 on the ''Billboard'' 200. Five singles were released and all five charted. The lead-off single, \"[[You Won't Be Lonely Now]]\", was the highest-peaking single from the album, charting to No. 17. Other singles include \"We the People\" (No. 60), \"Burn Down the Trailer Park\" (No. 43), \"Crazy 'Bout You Baby\" (No. 58), and the title track (No. 45).\n\n===Shift to Christian music===\nAfter the singles from ''Southern Rain'' finished their chart runs, Cyrus recorded two Christian albums. Both albums, ''[[Time Flies (Billy Ray Cyrus album)|Time Flies]]'' and ''[[The Other Side (Billy Ray Cyrus album)|The Other Side]]'', were released in 2003. The first album debuted and peaked at a low No.&nbsp;56 on the Country album charts. Three singles were released; however, only the final single reached the charts. \"Bread Alone\", \"What Else Is There\", and \"Back to Memphis\" were released, and \"Back to Memphis\" charted to No.&nbsp;60.\n\nThe second Christian album, ''The Other Side'', was recorded while Cyrus filmed his [[PAX (TV network)|PAX]] series, ''[[Doc (2001 TV series)|Doc]]''. It debuted at No.&nbsp;5 on the [[Top Christian Albums]] chart, No.&nbsp;18 Top Country Albums, and No.&nbsp;131 on ''Billboard'' 200. Two of three singles charted \u2013 \"Face of God\" (No. 54) and \"The Other Side\" (No. 45) \u2013 while \"Always Sixteen\" did not chart.\n\n===Disney Entertainment===\nThe album ''[[Wanna Be Your Joe]]'' was Billy Ray's first country album since 2000's ''Southern Rain''. It was again recorded on a new record label: New Door/UMe Records. It was released while Cyrus was filming the show ''[[Hannah Montana]]''. ''Wanna Be Your Joe'' made it to No.&nbsp;24 on the Country charts and No.&nbsp;113 on the all-genre charts. The album initially sold well, but no hit-single was released. The title track was released as the first single, and was followed by \"I Want My Mullet Back\", both of which were ignored by country radio. Although not released as a single, a music video was made for the track \"Stand\", a duet with daughter [[Miley Cyrus]].\n\nAlso in 2006, Billy Ray appeared with metal-rock group [[Metal Skool]] (now [[Steel Panther]]), and performed several songs including \"[[Rebel Yell (song)|Rebel Yell]]\" by [[Billy Idol]], and the song \"I Want My Mullet Back\", which appears on ''Wanna Be Your Joe''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpah6c4plII |title=Billy Ray & Metal Skool |publisher=YouTube |date=November 1, 2006 |access-date=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924165227/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpah6c4plII |archive-date=September 24, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nHe also sang \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner|The Star Spangled Banner]]\" at Game 5 of the [[2006 World Series]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].\n\n===Career re-launch===\nIn mid-2007, Cyrus was a celebrity contestant on the 4th season of the show ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 4)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. Cyrus was partnered with [[Karina Smirnoff]]. He quickly became a fan favorite. Cyrus and Smirnoff made it to the semi-finals, where they finished in 5th place.\n\nFrom Cyrus's exposure on ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'' and ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', his record label pushed up the release date by a month for his new album. ''[[Home at Last (Billy Ray Cyrus album)|Home at Last]]'' was released in July 2007 on [[Walt Disney Records]]. It debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the country charts, making it Cyrus' first top 5 entry since 1993. Beginning sales for the album were very strong; however, the album failed to be certified. The single \"[[Ready, Set, Don't Go]]\", was initially released as a solo single. The solo version made it to No.&nbsp;33 on the Hot Country Songs chart.\n\nIn October 2007, Cyrus and his daughter [[Miley Cyrus|Miley]] performed a duet of the song on ''Dancing with the Stars''. The duet debuted at No.&nbsp;27 on the Country charts and eventually peaked at No.&nbsp;4 in 2008, giving Billy Ray his first top 5 single since 1999, as well as Miley's first top 5 on any ''Billboard'' chart.\n\nCyrus was a part of the Disney collection ''[[Country Sings Disney]]'' in 2008. Two of his songs, \"Ready, Set, Don't Go\" and the [[Sheryl Crow]]-penned song \"[[Real Gone (song)|Real Gone]]\", appeared on the album. Billy Ray's version of \"Real Gone\" was also made into a music video that is in rotation on both [[Country Music Television|CMT]] and [[Great American Country|GAC]]; the song also appears on ''[[Back to Tennessee]]''.\n\n=== New label and newfound chart success ===\n[[File:Billy Ray Cyrus at Kids Inaugural Concert.jpg|thumb|Cyrus singing at the ''Kids Inaugural Event'' in January 2009]]\n\nIn late 2008, his website announced that a new studio album would be released by the end of the year from [[Lyric Street Records]], entitled ''[[Back to Tennessee]]''.

Amen,\" after telling jokes of questionable taste; and, \"I don't care who ya are, that's funny right there,\" after jokes that evoke raucous laughter.\n\nHis first two comedy albums, ''Lord, I Apologize'' (2001) and ''The Right to Bare Arms'' (2005), have both been [[RIAA certification|certified]] [[gold album|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].

They recorded three [[studio album]]s: ''[[Trick Pony (album)|Trick Pony]]'', ''[[On a Mission (Trick Pony album)|On a Mission]]'', and ''[[R.I.D.E.]]'', released in 2001, 2002, and 2005. These albums produced eight [[single (music)|singles]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, including four Top 20 hits: \"[[Pour Me (Trick Pony song)|Pour Me]]\", \"[[On a Night like This (Trick Pony song)|On a Night like This]]\", \"[[Just What I Do]]\", and \"On a Mission\".\n\nIn 2006, Newfield departed for a solo career and Aubrey Collins replaced her as lead vocalist. The group disbanded after Collins and Dean left in 2007 and 2008. Newfield released a solo debut album, ''[[What Am I Waiting For]]'', in 2008 on [[Curb Records]], while Burns joined singer Michelle Poe to form a duo called [[Burns & Poe]].

They also recorded a tribute song to [[The Blackwood Brothers]], who influenced their music.

Due to their expanding career, the Statlers left Cash's entourage around the mid-1970s to concentrate on their own career, a departure that took place on good terms.\n\nTwo of the Statlers' best-known songs are \"[[Flowers on the Wall]],\" their first major hit that was composed and written by Lew DeWitt, and the socially conscious \"[[Bed of Rose's]]\". In the 1980s, the Statlers were a mainstay on [[Spike TV|The Nashville Network (TNN)]], where their videos were shown regularly. Also on TNN, between 1991 and 1998, they hosted ''[[The Statler Brothers Show]]'', a weekly [[variety show]], which was the network's top-rated program for its entire 7-year run.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmacanada.ca/go/site/news/2007/09/ |title=Biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214092844/http://www.gmacanada.ca/go/site/news/2007/09/ |archive-date=December 14, 2007 |website=Rex Allen, Jr.'s official website |access-date=April 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-01-07-9501070171-story.html |title=Statler Bros.'

They recorded two comedy albums under the [[pseudonym]] Lester \"Roadhog\" Moran and the Cadillac Cowboys, and one-half of one side of the album ''Country Music Then and Now'' was devoted to satirizing small-town radio stations' Saturday-morning shows.\n\nThe Statlers earned the number-one spot on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]] four times, for \"[[Do You Know You Are My Sunshine]]?\" in 1978, \"[[Elizabeth (The Statler Brothers song)|Elizabeth]]\" in 1984, and in 1985, \"[[My Only Love (song)|My Only Love]]\" and \"[[Too Much on My Heart]].\"<ref name=\"CMT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/statler_brothers/bio.jhtml |title=Artist Biography: The Statler Brothers |access-date=April 17, 2008 |work=[[Country Music Television]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325074504/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/statler_brothers/bio.jhtml |archive-date=March 25, 2008}}</ref> Since forming, the Statlers have released over 40 albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thestatlerbrothers.com/discography/ |title=Discography |website=The Statler Brothers' Official website |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://statlerbrothers.com/ |title=The Statlers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155220/http://statlerbrothers.com/ |archive-date=May 9, 2008 |access-date=April 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the Statler Brothers purchased and renovated their former elementary school, Beverly Manor, in Staunton, occupying the complex for several years. The complex consisted of offices for the group, a small museum and auditorium, and an adjacent building that served as office space for unrelated businesses. A garage was built to store the two tour buses that the group had used for many years. The group has since sold the complex, which Grace Christian Church in Staunton converted back into an academic campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gcswarriors.org/contact-us/directions.cfm |title=Elementary/Middle School Directions |website=Grace Christian School |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the group began performing at an annual [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] festival in Gypsy Hill Park in Staunton. The event, known as \"Happy Birthday USA,\" lasted for 25 years, and included many country-music figures, including [[Mel Tillis]], [[Charley Pride]], and many others. The event drew as many as 100,000 fans each year. The group also honored their hometown with the song \"Staunton, Virginia\" on their 1973 album ''Do You Love Me Tonight''.\n\nDeWitt retired from the Statler Brothers in 1982 due to ill health.

He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in his early teens, after starting out playing in a family band with his mother [[Hazel Smith]], father Patrick Smith, and brother, Billy Smith. Terry has played with such legends as [[Jimmy Martin]], [[Wilma Lee Cooper]], and the [[Osborne Brothers]]. Terry and his brother, Billy, recorded an album for [[Sony Music|CBS]] Records, which evolved to a number one video on [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] with \"Blues Stay Away From Me.\"  After touring with [[Grand Ole Opry]] member [[Mike Snider (musician)|Mike Snider]], Terry joined the Grascals and remains as a founding member.\n\n=== Danny Roberts ===\n\nDanny Roberts started playing guitar to back up Jimmy Mattingly when they were growing up in [[Leitchfield, Kentucky]]. He began to win contests for his guitar playing, and eventually, mandolin. In 1982, he co-founded the New Tradition, bluegrass/[[gospel music|gospel]] group that toured the country for close to 20 years. The band recorded 10 CDs, made \"Seed of Love\" song, the first bluegrass video to feature the [[banjo]], and even reached number one on the [[The Nashville Network|TNN]] channel. That band broke up in 2000, but Danny still continued to play with others including [[Marty Raybon]], [[Larry Cordle]], and [[Melonie Cannon]]. He also joined Ronnie Reno's band, the Reno Tradition. Danny joined the Grascals as a founding member, where he was reunited with Jimmy Mattingly.\n\n=== Kristin Scott Benson ===\nKristin Scott Benson grew up in South Carolina in a musical family and joined the Grascals in January 2009.

This album featured such songs as \"Me and John and Paul\" written by [[Harley Allen]], \"[[Where Corn Don't Grow]]\" and another popular cover song, \"Viva Las Vegas,\" which featured Dolly Parton.

They were soon joined by Gene Dobkin, a classmate of Benson's at [[Antioch College]], and Chris O'Connell. The group relocated to [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] in 1973 after a suggestion from [[Willie Nelson]].\n\nSince then, the group has released more than twenty albums and earned nine [[Grammy]] awards. Though the band's lineup has changed greatly over the years (about 90 people have been part of Asleep at the Wheel at some point), Benson has always remained at the helm as the band's driving force.\n\nIn addition to his work with Asleep at the Wheel, Benson is also an accomplished producer whose credits include albums by [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]], [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Aaron Watson]], James Hand and [[Carolyn Wonderland]]; also single tracks for Willie Nelson, [[Aaron Neville]], [[Brad Paisley]], [[Pam Tillis]], [[Trace Adkins]], [[Merle Haggard]], and [[Vince Gill]].\n\nIn 2003, Benson released his first solo album entitled ''Beyond Time''.\n\nBenson is also a founding member of the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation]], which raises money to help aging [[R&B]] artists, and a member of the board of directors of the SIMS Foundation, which provides low-cost mental health services to Austin musicians and their families.  He is also a trustee for the Texas chapter of [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences|NARAS]], a board member of St Davids Community Health Foundation, and a board member and founding member of Health Alliance for Austin Musicians (HAAM).\n\nRay Benson is the former host of the ''Texas Music Scene'' TV show. In an interview, Benson said that when he was on the Board of Directors for Austin City Limits, he urged them to start a spin-off show that focused on Texas bands because Austin City Limits had grown beyond its original scope to become an international show. Later he had the opportunity to work with executive producer Tom Hoitsma to host the Texas Music Scene TV, which showcases Texas bands.<ref>from an interview on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode179 episode 179 of the Americana Music Show], released February 17, 2014</ref>\n\n== \"A Ride With Bob\" ==\n\nIn the Spring of 2005, Ray Benson and Asleep At The Wheel began the production of \"A Ride With Bob\" that follows the travels of legendary singer/songwriter [[Bob Wills]]. A Ride With Bob includes the live performance of 15 of Wills\u2019 best-known songs in a plot that interweaves Ray Benson\u2019s present day with various stages in Wills\u2019 storied career. The play continues to tour throughout the country.{{cn|date=February 2023}}\n\n==Awards==\nBenson has been presented numerous awards throughout his career. Most recently, the 16th Annual Midsouth Regional Emmy Award for the making of \"A Ride With Bob\", an Honorary Junior Member of the United States Secret Service, and the Darrel K. Royal Music Patron Award by The Texas Heritage Songwriters' Association. In 2007, the Austin Chronicle recognized Benson for Male Vocals, Band of the Year, Songwriter, Record Producer, and for the Country Genre. Benson was inducted into the Austin Music Hall of Fame in 2002, was given The Texas Music Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 1996, and recognized as an Outstanding Producer by the National Academy of Recording Arts in 1988. He has also been given numerous Citations of Achievement by Broadcast Music, Inc. for his work in the country music field. Ray Benson has been one of the strongest names in Country Music for the last forty years. He has earned nine Grammy awards in four different decades.\n\n==Willie And The Wheel==\nIn February 2009, Asleep at the Wheel and Willie Nelson released ''[[Willie and the Wheel]]'', a western swing collaboration suggested by veteran producer [[Jerry Wexler]]. Nelson has a long-time interest in western swing and had toured with the band in 2007.

They began performing together in the 1990s as part of two different bands with Montgomery's brother, [[John Michael Montgomery]]. Although Gentry won a talent contest in 1994, he reunited with Eddie Montgomery after Gentry was unable to find a solo record deal, and Montgomery Gentry was formed in 1999. The duo is known for its [[Southern rock]] influences, and has collaborated with [[Charlie Daniels]], [[Toby Keith]], [[Five for Fighting]], and members of [[The Allman Brothers Band]].\n\nMontgomery Gentry released six studio albums for [[Columbia Records]]' Nashville division: ''[[Tattoos & Scars]]'' (1999), ''[[Carrying On]]'' (2001), ''[[My Town (album)|My Town]]'' (2002), ''[[You Do Your Thing]]'' (2004), ''[[Some People Change]]'' (2006), and ''[[Back When I Knew It All]]'' (2008), and a Greatest Hits package. These albums produced more than twenty chart singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, including the {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 1 hits, \"[[If You Ever Stop Loving Me]]\", \"[[Something to Be Proud Of]]\", \"[[Lucky Man (Montgomery Gentry song)|Lucky Man]]\", \"[[Back When I Knew It All (song)|Back When I Knew It All]]\", and \"[[Roll with Me]]\". Ten more of their songs reached the Top 10 on the country chart, including the {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 3 hit, \"[[Gone (Montgomery Gentry song)|Gone]]\", the most played country song by a duo in 2005. ''Tattoos & Scars'', ''My Town'', and ''You Do Your Thing'' are all [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. In 1999, they were awarded Favorite New Artist\u2014Country at the [[American Music Awards]]. Both the [[Academy of Country Music]] and [[Country Music Association]] named them Duo of the Year in 2000, awards for which they were nominated by one or both associations in every year until 2012. In 2009, they were inducted into the [[Grand Ole Opry]].\n\nOn September 8, 2017, Gentry died in [[2017 Medford, New Jersey helicopter crash|a helicopter crash]] in [[Medford, New Jersey|Medford]], New Jersey, where the duo was scheduled to perform that evening.

Regarding the name changes during this period (1993\u20131997), Oldham said:\n{{cquote|I guess the idea is that when you have a name of a group or an artist, then you expect that the next record, if it has the same name, should be the same group of people playing on it.

Before signing to a record deal, Anderson was one of several co-writers on \"Beer Run (B Double E Double R-U-N)\", a duet by [[Garth Brooks]] and [[George Jones]], released in late 2001. Anderson was signed as a recording artist to [[Arista Nashville]] in 2004. His debut single \"[[Pickin' Wildflowers]]\" was released that year, as the lead-off track from his debut album ''[[Three Chord Country and American Rock & Roll]]''. Counting \"Pickin' Wildflowers\", the album produced a total of four hit singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].\n\nIn addition to his own material, Anderson co-wrote [[Big & Rich]]'s single \"[[Lost in This Moment]]\", a Number One hit on the country music charts in mid-2007. Anderson switched to the [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] label in 2007, and his second album, ''[[C'mon! (Keith Anderson album)|C'mon!]]'', was released on August 5, 2008. The second single from the album, \"[[I Still Miss You]]\", became his first Top 5 country hit.\n\nHis latest release is a six-song EP album titled ''I'll Bring the Music''; it was released May 12, 2015.\n\n== Early life ==\nWhile growing up in Miami, Oklahoma, he played sports during [[Middle School|middle]] and high school, and began his music career by playing in a band at church.<ref name=\"bio\">{{cite web|url=http://www.keithanderson.com/bio/index.php|title=Biography|publisher=Keith Anderson|access-date=September 19, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701050947/http://www.keithanderson.com/bio/index.php|archive-date=July 1, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> After graduating from high school, he attended [[Oklahoma State University]],<ref name=\"bio\" /> where he was a member of [[Delta Tau Delta]] fraternity.

He has released five studio albums, and has charted four singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the top 40 hit \"Pound Sign (#?*!)\". In addition, he wrote [[Sammy Kershaw]]'s 2003 single \"Beer, Bait & Ammo\", [[Mark Chesnutt]]'s 2004 single \"The Lord Loves the Drinkin' Man\" and [[Montgomery Gentry]]'s 2009 single \"[[Long Line of Losers]]\".\n\n==Early life==\nFowler was born in [[Amarillo, Texas]], the younger of two children. His father introduced him to country music when he was a child, and as a teenager Fowler also developed a liking for rock music.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He graduated in 1984 from [[Tascosa High School]] in Amarillo.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Long interested in making music, Fowler began piano lessons as a young child. When he was twenty, he realized that he wanted to seriously pursue a career in music and moved to Los Angeles, California, to attend the Guitar Institute of Technology. For the next year, he learned how to play the guitar and began writing songs.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nAfter gaining a good knowledge of the guitar, Fowler left Los Angeles for [[Austin, Texas]]. He was a guitarist with the rock band ''[[Dangerous Toys]]'' in the early 1990s, but left to form his own [[Southern rock|Southern hard-rock]] band, ''Thunderfoot.'' In 1998, he left rock music all together to form a new band that would concentrate instead on Texas country music. Fowler and his new band earned themselves a weekly gig at Babe's on [[6th Street (Austin)|Sixth Street]] in Austin. Two years later, with no recording contracts, Fowler recorded and released his own debut album, ''[[Beer, Bait & Ammo]]''. This album sold over 30,000 copies in Texas, with the title track receiving a great deal of airplay. This song was popular enough that [[Mark Chesnutt]] began playing it in his live show, and [[Sammy Kershaw]] recorded it for one of his own albums.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web  | last = Birchmeier  | first = Jason  | title = Kevin Fowler Biography  | publisher = AllMusic  | url ={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p457811|pure_url=yes}} | access-date = March 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nFowler signed with country singer [[Clint Black]]'s independent ''[[Equity Music Group|Equity Music]]'' (a label distributed by [[Koch Entertainment]]) and released two additional albums for that label until Equity ceased operations in December 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hypebot.com/hypebot/2008/12/nashville-feels.html|title=Nashville Feels The Pain: Equity Music Group Folds|website=Hypebot.com|access-date=January 1, 2019}}</ref> [[Montgomery Gentry]] recorded a cover of Fowler's \"[[Long Line of Losers]].\"<ref name=\"lyric\"/>\n\nIn January 2010, Fowler signed to [[Lyric Street Records]], releasing \"Beer Season\" that same month.<ref name=\"lyric\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2010/01/lyric-street-signs-kevin-fowler/|title=Lyric Street signs Kevin Fowler|last=Cronin|work=The Boot|first=Peter|date=January 27, 2010|access-date=April 19, 2010}}</ref> His second single, \"Pound Sign (#?*!),\" followed in April.

When DeWitt was suffering from [[Crohn's disease]] and needed a temporary replacement, he asked Fortune to come to audition for the band in Nashville.

He joined the group permanently later in the year when DeWitt decided to quit the group due to his illness.<ref name=\"cleveland\"/>\n\nFortune wrote several number-one songs that were recorded by the [[Statler Brothers]], including \"[[Elizabeth (Statler Brothers song)|Elizabeth]]\", \"[[Too Much on My Heart]]\", and \"[[My Only Love (song)|My Only Love]]\". \"[[More Than a Name on a Wall]]\" was a top ten country hit. \"Elizabeth\" recently was a top bluegrass release for [[Dailey & Vincent]]. He spent 21 years touring, singing, and performing with the Statler Brothers.\n[[File:Jimmy Fortune Statue - 02.jpg|thumb|Statue of Fortune in [[Nelson County, Virginia]]]]\n\nIn 2002, after the Statlers disbanded, Fortune continued his career as a solo artist with an extensive performance schedule in the U.S. and Canada.

He was raised in [[Buckley, Washington]]. At age fifteen, he recorded his debut album ''In My High School'' on Giantslayer Records, an independent record label. The album was re-issued in 2005 as ''[[Off to Join the World]]'' by [[BNA Records]]. Blaine's second album, ''[[Rockin' You Tonight]]'', was issued in June 2006, also on BNA. Larsen's two albums for that label have produced five chart singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, of which the highest-peaking was \"How Do You Get That Lonely\" at number 18. Larsen left BNA in 2009, in favor of Treehouse Records and consequently with [[Stroudavarious Records]], but is now unsigned.\n\n==Career==\nLarsen was introduced to music very early. By age 10, Larsen had begun singing along to country karaoke tapes, and by age 13 he learned to play guitar as well.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> When Larsen was a junior in high school, he and his family made a trip to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where Larsen recorded a demo CD composed mainly of cover songs. This CD also included a song that he had co-written with his school teacher.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Nashville songwriters [[Rory Lee Feek]] and [[Tim Johnson (songwriter)|Tim Johnson]] discovered Larsen's demo CD. They then flew him back Nashville again to hold a recording session with him, and by 2004, his debut album ''In My High School'' was released on Feek and Johnson's label, Giantslayer Records.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The album's lead-off single, which was the title track, received some airplay particularly in [[Seattle]] also reaching 60 on the country charts that year.\n\nAfter \"In My High School\" began receiving airplay, Sandy Conklin, an employee at BMG in Seattle sent a note to Joe Galante, head of the BMG labels in Nashville, recommending Larsen. Galante auditioned him and agreed to sign him at the end of 2004. Larsen was signed to BMG-affiliated [[BNA Records]] label.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050104014849/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/larsen_blaine/bio.jhtml CMT: Blaine Larsen biography]</ref> BNA then added a bonus track to ''In My High School'', re-releasing the album in early 2005 under the title ''[[Off to Join the World]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Larsen had co-written six of the ten songs on the album. BNA also released two more singles from the album: \"[[How Do You Get That Lonely]]\", which peaked at number 18. It was followed by \"The Best Man\" at number 36.\n\nIn 2006, Larsen released his second studio album, also a joint effort between BNA and Giantslayer. Entitled ''[[Rockin' You Tonight]]'', this album produced two more chart singles for Larsen: the 24 \"I Don't Know What She Said\" and the 42 \"Spoken Like a Man\". The former was co-written by [[Warner Bros. Records]] artist [[Lane Turner]]. ''Rockin' You Tonight'' also included [[cover version|cover]]s of [[Mac Davis]] \"[[Baby, Don't Get Hooked on Me]]\" and [[Mark Chesnutt]]'s \"I'm in Love with a Married Woman\", as well as a duet with [[Gretchen Wilson]] entitled \"Lips of a Bottle\". He also recorded separately a cover of \"I Wish That I Could Fall in Love Today\" on a tribute album to [[Barbara Mandrell]]. He also toured with renowned artists opening for their shows, including [[Brad Paisley]], [[Rascal Flatts]] and [[Kenny Chesney]]. He charted with a cover of \"[[Away in a Manger]]\", and also co-wrote the track \"[[I Gotta Get to You]]\" on [[George Strait]]'s album ''[[Twang (album)|Twang]]''.\n\nLarsen exited BNA in 2008, and signed to Treehouse Records, a label founded by his management company, in June 2009.<ref name=\"musicrow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2009/06/treehouse-records-launches-blaine-larsen/|title=Treehouse Records Launches Blaine Larsen|last=Skates|first=Sarah|work=Music Row|date=June 15, 2009 |accessdate=June 18, 2009}}</ref> He was the first artist to sign for the label. After one year of operations, Treehouse Records merged in [[Stroudavarious Records]]. Larsen's next album ''Not Too Bad'' was tipped to be under the new label. A lead-off single from the prospective album, entitled \"It Did,\" made its chart debut in August 2009. It was followed by \"Chillin'\" (a minor Top 40 hit) and \"Leavin',\" but the album was eventually shelved after Stroudavarious folded into J&R Records without signing Larsen.\n\n==Personal life==\nLarsen was born in [[Tacoma, Washington]]. When he was five years old, his parents divorced; he, his mother Jenny, and his sister Lindsey then moved to [[Buckley, Washington]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> His father often promised to visit or call, but he never did. A family friend named Woody who worked side jobs as a contractor took Blaine Larsen with him on weekend jobs. One of those jobs, converting Larsen's grandmother's garage into a living space, led to romance between Woody and Blaine's mother Jenny. They later married, and Woody legally adopted Larsen just before he turned 18.

Originally, they assumed the name Kyote Wylde, but after developing a significant fanbase, the band changed its name to Crossin Dixon in 2004, to reflect their widespread touring.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The band was recommended to record producer [[Michael Knox (record producer)|Michael Knox]], who had also worked with [[Jason Aldean]], and by 2006, Crossin Dixon was signed to [[Broken Bow Records]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Their first single, entitled \"Guitar Slinger\", was released to radio in July 2007; both it and the followup, \"Make You Mine\", charted on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts that year. They released a third single, \"I Love My Old Bird Dog (& I Love You Too)\" in 2008, but the single failed to chart.  Their self-titled debut was released digitally on December 16, 2008. They released a single called \"Lovin in the Country\" to radio and  on August 31, 2010, as the first single for an upcoming, untitled second album. A new single, \"Goodbye to Henry\", was released on December 6, 2010, but it failed to chart. \n\nCrossin Dixon took a brief hiatus in 2012 following the announcement of former singer, Jason Miller, to pursue a solo career. After careful thought and consideration for their fans, the two remaining members of Crossin Dixon, Brandon Hyde and Charlie Grantham, decided they would continue their tour starting in January 2013. The band broke up sometime in 2015, without making much noise or a formal announcement. \n\n==Discography==\n===''Crossin Dixon'' (2008)===\n{{Infobox album\n| italic_title = no\n| name       = ''Crossin Dixon''\n| type       = Studio\n| artist     = Crossin Dixon\n| cover      = CrossinDixon.jpg\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 18, 2008\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Country\n| length     = 38:53\n| label      = [[Broken Bow Records|Broken Bow]]\n| producer   = [[Michael Knox (record producer)|Michael Knox]]\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n}}\n;Track listing\n#\"Guitar Slinger\" ([[Rodney Clawson]], Jon Stone, [[Bob DiPiero]]) - 3:23\n#\"Don't Give Up on Me\" ([[Lee Brice]], Garrett Parris, [[Kyle Jacobs (musician)|Kyle Jacobs]]) -   3:37\n#\"Stomp\" (Clawson, Blair Daly, [[John Rich]]) - 3:07\n#\"Don't Waste Your Pretty\" ([[Willie Mack (musician)|Willie Mack]], Giles Godard) - 2:49\n#\"Let the Bad Times Roll\" ([[Brett James]], [[Hillary Lindsey]], [[Troy Verges]], Blair Daly) - 3:42\n#\"[[Nineteen (song)|Nineteen]]\" ([[Jeffrey Steele]], [[Gary Nicholson (singer)|Gary Nicholson]], [[Tom Hambridge]]) - 3:09\n#\"Make You Mine\" (Clawson, Stone) - 3:52\n#\"I Love My Old Bird Dog (& I Love You)\" (Bill Luther, James) - 4:09\n#\"I Can Try\" ([[Dave Berg (songwriter)|Dave Berg]], George Teren) - 3:06\n#\"Moonshine and Mountain Dew\" ([[Chris Tompkins]], [[Josh Kear]], [[Mark Irwin (songwriter)|Mark Irwin]]) - 3:13\n#\"Just Look What You've Done\" (James, [[John Bettis]]) - 4:46\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"60\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2007\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Guitar Slinger\"\n| 45\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''Crossin' Dixon''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Make You Mine\"\n| 47\n|-\n| 2008\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Love My Old Bird Dog (& I Love You)\"\n| \u2014\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2010\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Lovin' in the Country\"\n| \u2014\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"2\"| Non-album songs\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Goodbye to Henry\"\n| \u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!

He cut off contact with Elektra and refused to give them any material after the release of ''Sound & Fury''. Simpson claimed that Elektra \"[did not] know what the fuck to do\" with him, as he created ''Sound & Fury'' to be difficult to market, and left Elektra with a \"giant un-recouped debt\" upwards of a million dollars from costs relating to the album's companion film, which was similarly hard to promote.

DeWitt officially retired that same month with Fortune becoming his permanent replacement.<ref name=randommemories/>{{rp|96}}\n\nThree years later, DeWitt, feeling that his health had gradually improved through continued treatment, decided to pursue a solo career.

He is the younger brother of Lynyrd Skynyrd co-founder and former lead vocalist [[Ronnie Van Zant]], and of the [[38 Special (band)|38 Special]] founder [[Donnie Van Zant]].\n\n==Biography==\nDuring the 1970s, Van Zant performed with his first band, the Austin Nickels Band. They later changed their name to [[The Johnny Van Zant Band]] releasing their debut solo album, ''[[No More Dirty Deals]]'', in 1980. Early members of the Johnny Van Zant Band consisted of Van Zant on lead vocals, Robbie Gay on guitar, Danny Clausman, on bass, Erik Lundgren on lead guitar, Robbie Morris, drums and [[Joan Hecht]] (previously Joan Cusimano) and Nancy Henderson on background vocals. Van Zant released three more solo albums between 1981 and 1985, before taking a break from the music business.\n\nHe became lead vocalist and chief songwriter for the reunited Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987 and continues to record and perform with them today. He released another solo album, ''Brickyard Road'', in 1990, which featured the popular title track, which was a #1 hit on the U.S. [[Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart for three weeks. He also records and performs with his brother, Donnie, as [[Van Zant (band)|Van Zant]] since 1998. Van Zant and Lynyrd Skynyrd performed in Arizona on April 9, 2022, during Arizona Bike Week at WestWorld of Scottsdale. He stated that original member [[Gary Rossington]] was recovering and still needed prayers.\n\nIn May 2006, less than one day before he was to perform at [[KSAN (FM)|KSAN-FM]] 107.7 ''The Bone's Bone Bash 7'', Van Zant underwent emergency surgery to have his [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]] removed. Treated at [[Stanford University Medical Center]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], after reporting pain to a doctor earlier in the day. The incident forced the band to cancel three U.S. shows.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4997130.stm Notice of Johnny Van Zant surgery], bbc.co.uk; accessed August 11, 2015.</ref>\n\nVan Zant is a fan of the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].

He is best known for his role as the lead singer of [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], a [[country rock]] band that saw tremendous mainstream success throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Alabama became the most successful band in country music, releasing over 20 gold and platinum records, dozens of number 1 singles, and selling over 75&nbsp;million records during their career. Owen also maintains a career as a solo performer. He released his solo debut ''[[One on One (Randy Owen album)|One on One]]'' in late 2008 and charted two singles from it.\n\nOwen was inducted into the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2019.\n\n== Biography ==\nRandy Yeuell Owen grew up on a farm near Fort Payne, Alabama. He is of [[English people|English]] and [[Scottish people|Scots]] ancestry. He dropped out of high school in the ninth grade, but he returned and graduated from Fort Payne High in 1969.\nIn the late 1960s, Owen and his cousin, Teddy Gentry, began playing music together. They recruited another cousin, Jeff Cook, to form a band, which they called Wildcountry. Their first public performance was at a high school talent show, which they won.\n\nOwen's music career was put on hiatus as he earned an English degree from [[Jacksonville State University]]. He was also a member of [[Pi Kappa Phi]], Delta Epsilon Chapter. Upon his graduation, however, the three cousins moved into an apartment in [[Anniston, Alabama]], and by 1973 were pursuing a full-time music career. In 1980, the band, now called [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]], were signed to a recording contract by RCA Records and quickly reached country superstardom. For the next twenty-two years, Alabama had a tremendous impact on [[country music]], attracting a younger group of listeners, crossing over into pop radio, and paving the way for groups to be successful on country radio.\n\nAlabama released 21 gold, platinum, and multi-platinum albums, 42 singles that topped the charts at #1, and sold over 75 million records in total.  They have a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and were named the [[Academy of Country Music]]'s Artist of the Decade in 1989, and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]'s Country Group of the Century in 1999.\n\nIn May 2002, the band announced their retirement during the [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards telecast.  For the rest of 2002 and 2003, they performed throughout the country in their American Farewell Tour.  In 2005, the band was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].\n\nOwen lives on his cattle ranch outside Fort Payne. He currently serves as an at-large member of the Board of Trustees of [[Jacksonville State University]]. In 2007, he was a judge on Season 5 of the country talent show ''[[Nashville Star]]''.\n\nOwen took over hosting duties for ''Country Gold'', the Saturday night [[classic country]] request program on [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]], beginning July 21, 2012. The show was reformatted upon Owen's arrival, switching to a pre-recorded format (the show's predecessor, ''Country Gold Saturday Night'', was originally live; requests are handled, as they had been with Owen's immediate predecessor, by an [[answering machine]]) [[voice-tracking|voicetracked]] from Owen's home, drifting to a more open-ended \"traditional country\" format (one that includes more 1990s songs and even some 2000s songs along with country-pop tunes more commonly associated with the [[classic hits]] format while moving away from the core songs of the classic country format) and shortening the show from five hours to four. (In protest of the change of format, previous ''Country Gold'' host Rowdy Yates relaunched his version of the show as \"The Original Country Gold\" through [[Compass Media Networks]] a year later.) Owen ended his run as host on April 2, 2016, with [[Terri Clark]] replacing him the following weekend.\n\n== Discography ==\n{{See also|Alabama discography}}\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br /><ref name=\"Allmusic albums\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p111754|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( Randy Owen > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums )))|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=April 4, 2010}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br /><ref name=\"Allmusic albums\" />\n! width=\"45\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]<br /><ref name=\"Allmusic albums\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[One on One (Randy Owen album)|One on One]]''\n|\n* Release date: November 4, 2008\n* Label: [[Broken Bow Records]]\n| 14\n| 77\n| 5\n|}\n\n=== Singles ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"60\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]<br /><ref name=\"Allmusic singles\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p111754|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( Randy Owen > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles )))|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=April 4, 2010}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2008\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Braid My Hair\"\n| 45\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''One on One''\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Like I Never Broke Her Heart\"\n| 41\n|-\n| 2009\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Holding Everything\" <small>(with [[Megan Mullins]])</small>\n| \u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|-\n|}2022 Gaither Easter Marathon \u201cI Need Thee Every Hour\u201d featuring Randy Owen and The Issacs.\n\n== Publications ==\n*''Born Country: My Life in Alabama \u2013 How Faith, Family, and Music Brought Me Home''.

His mother was a gospel singer as were his grandmother, great-grandmother, and aunts. Bice was [[nickname]]d \"Bogart\" as a newborn by his grandmother, \"Granny Madge\", because she thought he had \"[[Humphrey Bogart]] eyes\". His family continued to call him Bogart, but when Bice was in kindergarten he shortened it to \"Bo\" because he did not think Bogart was cool. Bice's parents divorced when he was very young, and his mother remarried years later. Bice grew up with his mother and step-father, Earle Downes, a Coca-Cola manager, step-sisters Jenny and Sharan Downes, and half-brother John Cohran. Bice has two other half-siblings, Candace and Matthew, on his biological father's side. The Downes family moved around the [[Southern United States|South]] frequently.

During the ensuing year of promotional appearances and touring, Bice continued to suffer with the recurring intestinal condition which had not been repaired by the August 2005 surgery. In the span of just a few months during his various tours, Bice was hospitalized 20 times, checking out of the hospitals each time to honor his performance commitments. In March 2006, Bice sang on the ''American Idol'' Top 16 Results Show. In April 2006, Bice was one of the celebrity drivers featured in the [[Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race]] held in [[Long Beach, California]], that was sponsored by [[Toyota]] to benefit various children's hospitals of Southern California.

The surgery came after several rounds of tests and doctors deemed his condition serious enough to operate immediately. The day after that surgery, a complication occurred and Bice had to undergo another surgery. During the subsequent recovery time, [[Ben Stiller]] invited Bice to record for the [[Will Ferrell]] film ''[[Blades of Glory]]'' produced by Stiller. Bice made several promotional appearances in connection with the releases.

He simultaneously spent a few weeks participating in a special tour called ''It Was Forty Years Ago Today'' with [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Denny Laine]], [[Lou Gramm]], and [[Christopher Cross]]. The tour paid tribute to the fortieth anniversary of the release of the [[Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt.

During his career, LeDoux recorded 36 albums (many self-released), which have sold more than six million units in the United States as of January 2007. He was awarded two gold and one platinum album certifications from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]], and was honored with the [[Academy of Country Music]] Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award. LeDoux is also the only person to participate and also perform at the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nLeDoux was born in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], on October 2, 1948. He was of [[French people|French]] descent on his father's side. His father was in the [[US Air Force]] and was stationed at Keesler Air Force Base at the time of his birth. The family moved often when he was a child, due to his father's Air Force career. He learned to ride horses while visiting his grandparents on their [[Wyoming]] farm.<ref name=\"cmt\"/> At age 13, LeDoux participated in his first rodeo, and before long was winning junior rodeo competitions.<ref name=\"huey\">{{cite web |last= Huey |first= Steve |title= Chris LeDoux |publisher= [[Allmusic]] |year= 2005 |url ={{BillboardURLbyName |artist=chris ledoux |bio=true}} |access-date= 2007-03-16}}</ref>\n\nLeDoux continued to compete in rodeo events and played football through his high-school years. When his family moved to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], he attended [[Cheyenne Central High School]].  After twice winning the Wyoming State Rodeo Championship bareback riding title during high school, LeDoux earned a rodeo scholarship to [[Casper College]] in [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]]. During his junior year at [[Eastern New Mexico University]], LeDoux won the Intercollegiate National [[saddle bronc and bareback riding|bareback riding]] championship.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |title= Chris LeDoux Biography |publisher= [[Country Music Television]] |year= 2005 |url= http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/ledoux_chris/bio.jhtml |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107135707/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/ledoux_chris/bio.jhtml |archive-date= November 7, 2011 |access-date= 2007-03-16 |url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nLeDoux married Peggy Rhoads on January 4, 1972.

After recording his songs in a friend's basement, LeDoux \"began selling his tapes at rodeo events out of the back of his pickup truck\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Chris LeDoux - LeDoux Country - Discography |url=https://www.ledouxcountry.com/discography/ |website=www.ledouxcountry.com |access-date=April 11, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\nIn 1976, LeDoux won the world bareback riding championship at the [[National Finals Rodeo]] in [[Oklahoma City]].<ref name=\"huey\"/> Winning the championship gave LeDoux more credibility with music audiences, as he now had proof that the cowboy songs he wrote were authentic.<ref name=\"coon\">{{cite web |last= Coon |first= Chuck |title= Chris LeDoux: Missing Chris |publisher= ChrisLedoux.com |year= 2005 |url =http://www.chrisledoux.com/bio3.htm |access-date= 2007-03-16 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070309150925/http://chrisledoux.com/bio3.htm |archive-date= March 9, 2007}}</ref> LeDoux continued competing for the next four years. He retired in 1980.<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\n===Music career===\nWith his rodeo career at an end, LeDoux and his family settled on a ranch in [[Kaycee, Wyoming]]. LeDoux continued to write and record his songs, and began playing concerts.<ref name=\"huey\"/> His concerts were very popular, and often featured a [[mechanical bull]] (which he rode between songs) and fireworks.<ref name=\"coon\"/> By 1982, he had sold more than 250,000 copies of his albums, with little or no marketing.  By the end of the decade, he had self-released 22 albums.<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\nDespite offers from various record labels, LeDoux refused to sign a recording contract, instead choosing to retain his independence and control over his work while enjoying his regional following.  In 1989, however, he shot to national prominence when he was mentioned in [[Garth Brooks]]' top-10 country hit \"[[Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)]]\". Capitalizing on the sudden attention, LeDoux signed a contract with [[Capitol Records]] subsidiary Liberty Records and released his first national album, ''[[Western Underground]]'', in 1991. His follow-up album, ''[[Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy]]'', was certified gold and reached the top 10. The [[Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy (song)|title track]], a duet with Brooks, became LeDoux's first and only top-10 country single, reaching number seven in 1992.<ref name=\"huey\"/> In concert, he ended the song by saying, \"Thanks, Garth!\"\n\nFor the 35th annual Grammy Awards in 1992, the single track \"Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy\" was nominated for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chris LeDoux |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/chris-ledoux |website=grammy.com |access-date=24 August 2017 |date=14 May 2017}}</ref> LeDoux and Brooks also received nominations from the [[Academy of Country Music]] for Vocal Duo of the Year and from the TNN/Music City News Country Awards for Vocal Collaboration of the Year.\n\nFor the next decade, LeDoux continued to record for Liberty. He released six additional records, including ''[[One Road Man]]'', which made the country top 40 in 1998.<ref name=\"huey\"/> Toward the end of his career, LeDoux began recording material written by other artists, which he attributed to the challenge of composing new lyrics.<ref name=\"coon\"/> With his 2000 release, ''Cowboy,'' he returned to his roots, re-recording many of his earliest songwriting creations.<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\nThe RIAA certified two gold and one platinum recordings for LeDoux. On February 22, 1993, the single \"Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy\" went gold. On June 2, 1997, the album ''The Best of Chris LeDoux'' went gold.

Engvall has released a number of stand-up comedy albums through [[Warner Records]] and the defunct [[BNA Records]]. His commercially successful album is the 1996 debut ''[[Here's Your Sign]]'', certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album derives its name from Engvall's signature routine \"here's your sign\", wherein he offers \"signs\" to people whom he deems lacking in intellect. He has toured as a comedian both by himself and as a member of [[Blue Collar Comedy Tour]], which included [[Jeff Foxworthy]], [[Larry the Cable Guy]], and [[Ron White]]. Engvall's television roles include ''[[Delta (American TV series)|Delta]]'', ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]'', ''[[The Bill Engvall Show]]'', and ''[[Lingo (American game show)|Lingo]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Ray Engvall Jr. was born in [[Galveston, Texas]] on July 27, 1957.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> His father, William Ray Engvall Sr., was a U.S. Navy doctor, who then went into private practice. Engvall spent most of his childhood living first in Galveston, then in [[Winslow, Arizona]], then moving back to near [[Dallas]], Texas during middle school.

Early notoriety came from hosting the cable show ''A Pair of Jokers'' with [[Rosie O'Donnell]] and an appearance on ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' where he played Blanche's son Matthew, a stockbroker turned aspiring comic. Other early appearances included hosting [[A&E Network]]s ''[[The Improv|An Evening at The Improv]]'' as well as stand-up routines on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Engvall Makes His First Appearance on Network Television {{!}} Carson Tonight Show | website=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzfDimg14Vo |access-date=19 October 2022 |language=en |date=1989-07-13}}</ref> and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]].<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nA career breakthrough happened in 1992 when Engvall was named Best Male Standup at the [[American Comedy Awards]]. His first role as a series regular came soon after when he was cast in the ABC series ''[[Delta (American TV series)|Delta]]'', starring [[Delta Burke]]. However, the show only lasted one season and Engvall returned to making the rounds of comedy clubs and the occasional television appearance until 1996 when he was cast with fellow comic and best friend [[Jeff Foxworthy]] in the [[NBC]] version of ''[[The Jeff Foxworthy Show]]''. Signed by [[Warner Records]] in 1996, Engvall released the first of a series of successful comedy albums, ''[[Here's Your Sign]]'', based on his signature joke. The album was [[Music recording sales certification|certified Platinum]] and peaked at number 5 on the Billboard Country album chart.

And the third week of competition, Bill saw his highest score of 24 with a Paso Doble to the Lone Ranger theme song. Throughout the rest of the show, the judges usually placed Engvall and Slater at the bottom of the leaderboard, but an enormous fan base kept them in the competition, resulting in higher-scoring contestants, e.g. [[Christina Milian]], [[Snooki]], [[Brant Daugherty]], [[Elizabeth Berkley]], and [[Leah Remini]] being voted out instead.\n\nOn November 18, Engvall and Slater made it to the finals, along with [[Amber Riley]], [[Jack Osbourne]] and [[Corbin Bleu]].

Signed to [[Mercury Nashville Records]] in 2003, he released his debut album ''You, Me, and the Windshield'' that year and charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts with the single \"Country Rock Star\". Five years later, he signed to [[Lyric Street Records]] and released the single \"I Love This Song\", which has also charted. In addition to his recording career, Marcel has directed several music videos, and has written charted singles for [[Josh Gracin]], [[Trace Adkins]], and [[Jessica Andrews]], to whom he is married.\n\n== Career ==\nBorn in [[Grosse Pointe, Michigan]], Marcel was a [[semi-professional sports|semi-pro]] [[ice hockey|hockey]] player until signing with [[Mercury Nashville Records]] in 2002.<ref name=\"gac\"/><ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p559061/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Marcel biography |accessdate=2008-07-25 |last=Kergan |first=Wade |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> For four years prior to this, while waiting for an opportunity, he sang at clubs, bars, and waited tables for extra money.\n\nIn 2003, he released his debut album ''[[You, Me and the Windshield]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The tracks \"Country Rock Star\" and \"Tennessee\" from this album were released as singles. After this he returned to writing songs for other artists.\n\nMarcel has co-written two of [[Josh Gracin]]'s singles: \"[[Nothin' to Lose (Josh Gracin song)|Nothin' to Lose]]\", which previously appeared on ''You, Me and the Windshield'', and \"[[Favorite State of Mind]]\". [[Jessica Andrews]] also released two of his songs as singles: \"[[There's More to Me Than You]]\" and \"Everything\". [[Rascal Flatts]], [[LeAnn Rimes]], and [[Big & Rich]] have also recorded his songs.<ref name=\"gac\"/>\n\nIn 2008, Marcel signed to [[Lyric Street Records]], releasing his third single, \"I Love This Song\" that year.<ref name=\"gac\"/> When the song failed to reach Top 40, he exited Lyric Street's roster. In February 2009, he signed to the Red Stripe Plane label. He had a cameo in ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'', playing guitar in [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]' band. He is also shown in Cyrus' video for \"[[Back to Tennessee (song)|Back to Tennessee]]\".\n\nOn February 17, 2009, Marcel released his fourth single, \"Believin'\", which is also the title track to his second album. The album was released on the Red Stripe Plane label, but neither the album or single charted on any ''Billboard'' chart.  In June 2010, Marcel released a new single titled \"It's Summertime.\" Later in the year, Marcel began directing [[music video]]s for other artists.\n\n==Personal life==\nMarcel became engaged to [[Jessica Andrews]] in October 2010, and the two were married on November 11, 2011.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120107213345/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1676414/top-10-country-newlyweds-of-the-year.jhtml CMT.com story on 2011 weddings]</ref> Andrews gave birth to the couple's son [[Rockwell Francois Chagnon]] on February 6, 2018.

Rick performed his first appearance at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas \"winging it\" as there was no time for rehearsals before the sold-out performances. Rick had seen Buck and the original Buckaroos live in Omaha when he was 13 years old and dreamed of performing with Buck on Hee Haw. At age 19 he made his way to Nashville and 5 years later, he was performing in a rock cover group at a Nashville night club when Buck himself came to watch him at the urging of Hee Haw music director, Charlie McCoy, and Hee Haw staff band players, [[Leon Rhodes]], and Tommy Williams. Buck hired Rick on the spot and invited him to the Hee Haw set the next day where his dream became a reality. Rick's first taping was the Hee Haw 10th Anniversary Show taped at the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Tn in October 1978. He was with the Buckaroos until leaving in 1981, following the band's nomination and win as \"Touring Band of the Year\" at the ACM Awards, to join the Epic Records vocal group Nightstreets, voted Billboard Magazine's Vocal Group of the Year 1981 for the single, \"Love In The Meantime\". Nightstreets featured female vocalist, Joyce Hawthorne, met Rick while recording as a background singer with the Buckaroos in the 1970s. Nightstreets toured with George Jones and Tammy Wynette from 1981 through 1982. Rick retired from the music industry in 1986.\n\nKnown for their signature red, white and blue colored guitars and fiddles, the Buckaroos in 1966 became only the second country music band to appear at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]]. The recording of this performance, released as ''[[Carnegie Hall Concert (Buck Owens album)|Carnegie Hall Concert]]'', is considered one of the greatest live country music albums. They also recorded and released live albums from appearances in [[London]], [[Norway]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  The Buckaroos also appeared on the Buck Owens Show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buckaroo.xyz/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304025259/https://www.buckaroo.xyz/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-03-04 |title=Home |date= |accessdate=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nThe Buckaroos recorded eight albums from 1967 to 1970, all of which were top sellers.

The group was formed in 1972 by Terry Efaw and Steve Reis, who played together under the name Scotch & Soda. After adding songwriter, lead singer, and guitarist Bobby E. McNelley, they branded themselves McGuffey Lane, the location of Reis's [[Athens, Ohio]], home.\n\nThe band eventually expanded to a sextet and became well-known locally, releasing their first album on their own Paradise Island record label. The [[LP record|LP]] sold more than 40,000 copies,<ref name=amg>{{cite web|author=Sandra Brennan |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mcguffey-lane-mn0000397192/biography |title=McGuffey Lane &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref> and eventually resulted in their signing with [[Atco Records]]. They reissued the debut in 1980 and toured with the [[Charlie Daniels Band]], [[The Judds]], and the [[Allman Brothers Band]]. The follow-up, ''Aqua Dream'', featured the single \"Start It All Over\", which spent three weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 97 in February 1982.<ref name=\"Hot 100 chart history\">{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/mcguffey-lane |title=McGuffey Lane &#124; Billboard |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2019-02-22 |archive-date=2019-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223094337/https://www.billboard.com/music/mcguffey-lane |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe group scored several minor hits on the country charts, but their label wanted to market them more as a pop-country act in the vein of [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]. They moved to [[Atlantic Records]] to focus more on country chart success, but as they prepared 1984's ''Day By Day'', keyboardist Tebes Douglass was killed in a [[car crash]]. Soon after, Bobby Gene McNelley left the group to pursue a solo career as a songwriter in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In 1985, McGuffey Lane was dropped from Atlantic. In 1986, they released a [[Christmas]] album in support of the Central Ohio Lung Association; toward the end of that year, they inked a sponsorship with [[Miller Beer]], but a planned comeback fizzled.\n\nThe group played into the late 1980s but had dissolved by 1990. In 1995, they reunited after releasing a greatest hits album, and continued performing locally in Ohio into the 2000s. Two full-length releases followed the reunion, in 1998 and 2002. On August 18, 2009,  they opened for [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] at [[Lifestyle Communities Pavilion|The LC]] in Columbus, Ohio. In March 2010, Lick Records signed a distribution deal with E1 Entertainment, which allows the new McGuffey Lane album to be sold in [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Best Buy]].\n\n==Zachariah's Red Eye Reunion==\nEvery January, McGuffey Lane holds an annual reunion concert featuring many acts who also played at Zachariah's Red Eye Saloon. The first two reunions were held at Villa Milano Banquet and Conference Center, located on Schrock Road on the northeast side of Columbus, Ohio. After the initial two events, John Schwab (who is the organizer of the event) started looking for a larger venue to host the reunion concert, as it had outgrown Villa Milano. He settled on Lifestyles Communities Pavilion (now [[KEMBA Live!]]). The 2013 Reunion currently holds the indoor attendance record at the LC. The fourteenth anniversary took place on January 25, 2014.\n\nSome acts who have taken part in the event are: Rob McNelly (son of original lead singer Bobby Gene McNelly and current guitarist for [[Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band]]), John David Call (steel guitarist for [[Pure Prairie League]]), Steve Smith, Gary Ballen, Delyn Christian, Tom Ingham, the Dan Orr Project, Cliff Cody, Grassanine, and [[Erica Blinn]].\n\n==Members==\n*Terry Efaw \u2013 Steel guitar, gutstring guitar, electric guitar\n*Steve Reis \u2013 Bass, vocals\n*Molly Pauken- Mandolin, acoustic guitar,

Although she has recorded three albums on various labels, only one of these \u2013 2006's ''[[Corn Fed (album)|Corn Fed]]'' \u2014 was released. In her career, she has charted four singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, with her highest-charting single being a 2002 cover of [[Deborah Allen]]'s \"Baby I Lied,\" at number 40. She also contributed the song \"Half a Man\" to the soundtrack for the 1998 film ''[[Happy, Texas (film)|Happy, Texas]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n\nAfter several years of touring the Midwest with her father running the soundboard and her mom running lights, Shannon decided to make the move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. She paid the bills singing songwriters' demo sessions and managed to maintain her touring schedule of 160 dates a year. Her vocal stylings and industrious approach did not go unnoticed. She is married to video director [[Shaun Silva]] who directed the video for \"Corn Fed.\"\n\n==Career==\nBrown's first recording contract was with [[Arista Nashville]] in 1997. A year later, she began work on her debut album ''A Tour of My Heart''. Although the album's lead-off single (titled \"I Won't Lie\") entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, ''A Tour of My Heart'' was ultimately unreleased. Brown also contributed the song \"Half a Man\" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Happy, Texas (film)|Happy, Texas]]'' in 1998\n\nIn late 2001, she left for the [[BNA Records|BNA]] label. While on BNA, she began work on a second album, from which two singles were released. The first of these, a song titled \"Baby I Lied,\" was a cover of [[Deborah Allen]]'s Top 5 hit single from 1983. Brown's cover became her only Top 40 hit upon its release. A second single from her BNA album, titled \"Untangle My Heart,\" also charted. Brown's second album also remained unreleased, however, and she exited BNA not long afterward.\n\n[[Warner Bros. Records]] signed Brown to her third recording contract in late 2005. That year, she made her fourth chart entry with the song \"Corn Fed.\" Reaching a peak of 47 on the country music charts, it served as the lead-off single to her first album for Warner Bros., also titled ''[[Corn Fed (album)|Corn Fed]]''. Her third album overall, ''Corn Fed'' was also Brown's first album to be released commercially. The album was produced by [[John Rich (musician)|John Rich]], one half of country music duo [[Big & Rich]]. After its second single, \"Pearls,\" failed to chart, Brown and Warner Bros. parted ways.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Corn Fed (album)|Corn Fed]]''\n| \n* Release date: February 28, 2006\n* Label: [[Warner Bros.

Signed to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|MCA Nashville]] Records in 1992, Byrd broke through on the country music scene that year with his 1993 single \"[[Holdin' Heaven]]\", which reached Number One on ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]]. Although he did not land a second Number One until 2002's \"[[Ten Rounds with Jose Cuervo]]\", Byrd has charted more than thirty hit singles in his career, including eleven additional Top Ten hits. He has also released ten studio albums and two greatest-hits albums, with four gold certifications and one double-platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. He was the on-air spokesman for the TNN Outdoors block from 1998 to 2000.\n\n==Biography==\nTracy Lynn Byrd was born December 17, 1966. He is the eldest child of Jerry Lynn and Brenda Vaughn Byrd. Tracy Byrd graduated from [[Vidor High School]] in May 1985. His first college experience was at [[Lamar University]], Beaumont, Texas. He began studying business at [[Texas State University]] (then called Southwest Texas State). While studying he sang with a local band in Beaumont called Rimfire led by Jeffrey Adams and Dave Adams, a band that also featured acts such as [[Mark Chesnutt]].\n\nOne of his friends coaxed him into singing a cover of [[Hank Williams]]' \"[[Your Cheatin' Heart]]\" at a local mall recording studio.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p37699/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Tracy Byrd biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=May 21, 2009}}</ref> The owner of the studio was so impressed with his version that he entered Byrd into a local talent contest.

Although the album earned [[RIAA]] gold certification, its final single (\"Why Don't That Telephone Ring\") peaked at No.&nbsp;39. [[Keith Stegall]] and [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] shared production duties on the album.\n\n====''No Ordinary Man''====\n''[[No Ordinary Man]]'' was the title of Byrd's second album, which was produced by [[Jerry Crutchfield]]. It was also his highest selling, earning a double-platinum certification for U.S. sales of two million copies. All four singles from the album reached Top Five: \"[[Lifestyles of the Not So Rich and Famous]]\", \"[[Watermelon Crawl]]\" (also his first entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], at No.&nbsp;81), \"[[The First Step (song)|The First Step]]\" and \"[[The Keeper of the Stars]]\".

It was led off by the No.&nbsp;15 \"Walkin' to Jerusalem\", followed by two ballads: the No.&nbsp;9-peaking title track and No.&nbsp;14 \"[[Heaven in My Woman's Eyes]]\", and finally the No.&nbsp;21-peaking \"[[4 to 1 in Atlanta]]\". This album also reunited him with Tony Brown, who would also produce all of his subsequent material for MCA.\n\n====''Big Love''====\n''[[Big Love (Tracy Byrd album)|Big Love]]'', released in 1996, was the title of Byrd's fourth album and its first single. \"[[Big Love (Tracy Byrd song)|Big Love]]\" returned him to the Top Five with a No.&nbsp;3 peak. After it came another Johnny Paycheck cover, this time of his 1971 single \"She's All I Got.\" Re-titled \"[[Don't Take Her She's All I Got]]\", Byrd's cover peaked at No.&nbsp;4. The album's other singles (\"Don't Love Make a Diamond Shine\" and \"Good Ol' Fashioned Love\") reached No.&nbsp;17 and No.&nbsp;47 respectively, with the latter being his first single since 1993 to miss Top 40. ''Big Love'' also became his third gold-selling album.\n\n====''I'm from the Country'' and ''Keepers: Greatest Hits''====\nByrd released his final studio album for MCA, ''[[I'm from the Country]]'', in late 1997.

This song was added to the album, which was originally to be titled ''Walkin' the Line'', after the rest of the album had already been completed. It also became his ninth Top 10 hit by reaching No.&nbsp;3 in early 1998 and his first No.&nbsp;1 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Country Tracks charts in Canada. Only one other single, the No.&nbsp;9 hit \"I Wanna Feel That Way Again\", was released from the album.\n\nIn 1999, Byrd then released a greatest-hits package entitled ''[[Keepers: Greatest Hits]]'', which is certified gold. This album was led off by the No.&nbsp;31 single \"When Mama Ain't Happy\" before he left the label.\n\n===1999\u20132004: RCA Records===\n\n====''It's About Time''====\nIn 1999, Byrd signed to [[RCA Records]] Nashville. Working with producer Billy Joe Walker, Jr., he released his sixth studio album, ''[[It's About Time (Tracy Byrd album)|It's About Time]]'', that year. This album featured a more [[country pop]] sound than its predecessors,<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"oldies\"/> and was led off by the No.&nbsp;11 \"[[Put Your Hand in Mine]]\". This song was co-written by [[Skip Ewing]] and [[Jimmy Wayne]]. The album's other two singles \u2014 \"[[Love, You Ain't Seen the Last of Me]]\" and \"Take Me With You When You Go\" \u2014 both landed outside the Top 40.\n\n====''Ten Rounds''====\n''[[Ten Rounds (Tracy Byrd album)|Ten Rounds]]'', his second album for RCA, was released in 2001. This album returned him to a more traditionally country sound.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> It was led off by \"A Good Way to Get on My Bad Side\", a duet with Mark Chesnutt.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> This song was a No.&nbsp;21 country hit, and Chesnutt's first Top 40 chart hit since \"This Heartache Never Sleeps\" two years previous. After it came the No.&nbsp;9 \"Just Let Me Be in Love\", and finishing off the album's single releases was its title track, \"[[Ten Rounds with Jos\u00e9 Cuervo]]\". In October 2002, this song became Byrd's second No. 1 country hit,<ref name=\"oldies\"/> and his first since \"Holdin' Heaven\" in 1993. It was also his only Top 40 pop hit, with a No.&nbsp;26 peak on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n====''The Truth About Men''====\nByrd charted at No.&nbsp;38 in early 2003 with \"Lately (Been Dreamin' 'Bout Babies)\", which was never included on an album.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> This song was followed by \"The Truth About Men\", a song whose second verse featured guest vocals from [[Blake Shelton]], [[Andy Griggs]] and [[Montgomery Gentry]]. This song was the title track to his final RCA album, ''[[The Truth About Men (album)|The Truth About Men]]'', which also produced his final Top Ten hit in the No.&nbsp;7 \"[[Drinkin' Bone]]\", as well as the No.&nbsp;53 \"How'd I Wind Up in Jamaica.\" Also included on this album was the [[Rodney Crowell]] composition \"[[Making Memories of Us]]\", which would later be a Number One country hit in 2005 for [[Keith Urban]].\n\n===2005: BNA Records===\n\n====''Greatest Hits''====\nByrd's second [[Greatest Hits (Tracy Byrd album)|greatest hits]] album was released in 2005 via [[BNA Records]], a sister label to RCA. This album reprised most of his RCA single releases, and included new recordings of \"I'm from the Country\" and \"The Keeper of the Stars.\" Also included on it were the new tracks \"Revenge of a Middle-Aged Woman\", \"Tiny Town\" and \"[[Johnny Cash (Tracy Byrd song)|Johnny Cash]]\". The first two were released as singles, with the former reaching No.&nbsp;34 and the latter failing to chart. \"Johnny Cash\" was later covered by [[Jason Aldean]] on his 2007 album ''[[Relentless (Jason Aldean album)|Relentless]]'', and was a No.&nbsp;6 country hit for him that year.\n\n===2006\u2013present: Blind Mule Records & later work===\n\n====''Different Things''====\nByrd released his next album, ''[[Different Things]]'', in 2006 via his own Blind Mule label. It was led off by the No.&nbsp;55 \"Cheapest Motel\",<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> co-written by Cole Deggs of [[Cole Deggs & the Lonesome]]. After this song came \"Better Places Than This,\" which failed to chart as well.\n\n===='' All American Texan '' ====\nIn June 2016, Byrd returned to the studio to work on his first project in a decade. This album, recorded at Rosewood Studios in Tyler, Texas, was self-produced and promoted. Byrd wrote eight of the album's ten tracks himself. The album was released in October 2016.\n\n===='' Tracy Byrd : Live at Billy Bob's Texas '' ====\nIn November 2019 Byrd released a live album, recorded in June 2019 with his band, The ByrdDawgs. The album was recorded at Billy Bob's Texas, and holds nineteen songs.\n\n===='' Tracy Byrd : Live at Billy Bob's Texas DVD '' ====\n\nThe DVD of Byrd's Billy Bob's Texas concert in June 2019, was released in November 2019. In addition to the music, it contains several interview segments with Byrd.\n\n==Charitable efforts==\nByrd has been the National Spokesperson for [[Special Olympics]] International for the [[Country Music Association]]. He developed a crank bait fishing lure marketed by Norman Lures called ''The Lifestyles of the Not So Rich & Famous''', named after his hit recording of the song written by [[Byron Hill]] and Wayne Tester. For every one of the lures sold Byrd donated ten cents to the Special Olympics.\n\nFor several years Byrd hosted an annual golfing/fishing/music event, \"The Tracy Byrd Homecoming Weekend,\" later called \"The Beaumont Boys Bash\", in Southeast Texas to raise money for local charities, including the [[March of Dimes]], the [[Children's Miracle Network]], and culminating in the donation of money to fund the Tracy Byrd [[Hyperbaric Medicine]] and Wound Care Center at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Beaumont. Byrd also raised money by soliciting pledges for his attempt to complete the 2002 Houston Marathon. He finished the marathon, and donated all of his pledges to the Children's Miracle Network.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tseentertainment.com/tracy-byrd/|title=All About Tracy|access-date=June 26, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2003 Byrd published ''Eat Like a Byrd: The Tracy Byrd Cookbook''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museumofthegulfcoast.org/Content/Personalities/Music_Legends/Tracy_Byrd |title=Museum of the Gulf Coast - Tracy Byrd |access-date=January 5, 2007 |archive-date=December 7, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207222555/http://museumofthegulfcoast.org/Content/Personalities/Music_Legends/Tracy_Byrd |url-status=dead }}</ref> He also launched a line of spices, rubs, and marinades to go along with it, called \"Tracy Byrd's Tiny Town Products\"; a portion of these sales were donated to the [[Children's Miracle Network]].\n\nOn December 28, 2012, he performed \"Amazing Grace\" at the memorial service for [[KFDM]] news anchor Bill Leger.<ref>{{cite news |last=Mieux |first=Mary |date=December 28, 2012 |title=KFDM's Bill Leger remembered |url=https://www.panews.com/2012/12/28/kfdms-bill-leger-remembered/ |work=Port Arthur News |location=online |access-date=November 10, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Tracy Byrd discography}}\n\n===Studio albums===\n*''[[Tracy Byrd (album)|Tracy Byrd]]'' (1993)\n*''[[No Ordinary Man]]'' (1994)\n*''[[Love Lessons (album)|Love Lessons]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Big Love (Tracy Byrd album)|Big Love]]'' (1996)\n*''[[I'm from the Country]]'' (1998)\n*''[[It's About Time (Tracy Byrd album)|It's About Time]]'' (1999)\n*''[[Ten Rounds (Tracy Byrd album)|Ten Rounds]]'' (2001)\n*''[[The Truth About Men (album)|The Truth About Men]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Different Things]]'' (2006)\n*''All American Texan'' (2016)\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n=== American Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[American Music Awards of 1994|1994]]\n|Tracy Byrd\n|[[American Music Award for Favorite Country New Artist|Favorite Country New Artist]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== TNN/Music City News Country Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[29th TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1995]]\n|Tracy Byrd\n|Male Star of Tomorrow\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[30th TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1996]]\n|\"[[The Keeper of the Stars]]\"\n|Single of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Academy of Country Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[31st Academy of Country Music Awards|1996]]\n|\"[[The Keeper of the Stars]]\"\n|Song of the Year\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[39th Academy of Country Music Awards|2004]]\n|\"[[The Truth About Men (album)|The Truth About Men]]\"\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Country Music Association Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[1995 Country Music Association Awards|1995]]\n|\"[[The Keeper of the Stars]]\"\n|[[Country Music Association Award for Single of the Year|Single of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[2003 Country Music Association Awards|2003]]\n|\"[[The Truth About Men (album)|The Truth About Men]]\"\n|[[Country Music Association Award for Musical Event of the Year|Vocal Event of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Tracy Byrd}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Byrd, Tracy}}\n[[Category:1966 births]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American male singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Beaumont, Texas]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Texas]]\n[[Category:MCA Records artists]]\n[[Category:RCA Records Nashville artists]]\n[[Category:People from Vidor, Texas]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

His musical style has been described as a blend of [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]], and [[country music|country]]. He is the son of country musician [[Hank Williams]] and the father of musicians [[Holly Williams (musician)|Holly Williams]] and [[Hank Williams III]], and the grandfather of [[Coleman Williams]]. He is also the half brother of [[Jett Williams]].\n\nWilliams began his career following in his famed father's footsteps, covering his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams' first television appearance was in a December 1963 episode of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on ''[[Shindig!]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929947/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t130|title=Hank Williams, Jr.|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs Williams struggled to define his own voice and place within the [[country music]] genre, his style began slowly to evolve.

Williams first stepped onto the stage and sang his father's songs when he was eight years old.\n\nHe attended [[John Overton High School]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he would bring his guitar to music class and play for pep rallies and performances with the choir.\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1964, Williams made his recording debut with \"[[Long Gone Lonesome Blues]]\", one of his father's many classic songs.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944\u20132006, Second edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=388 |language=en |isbn=0823082911 }}</ref>\n\nHe provided the singing voice of his father<ref name=\"pc9\">{{Pop Chronicles |9 |4|Hank Williams Jr.}}</ref> in the 1964 film ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058765/ |title=Your Cheatin' Heart |date=December 1, 1964 |website=IMDb.com}}</ref> He also recorded an album of duets with recordings of his father.<ref name=\"pc9\" />\n\n===A change in appearance and musical direction===\nAlthough Williams' recordings earned him numerous country hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s with his role as a \"Hank Williams impersonator\", he became disillusioned and severed ties with his mother.\n\nBy the mid-1970s Williams began to pursue a musical direction that would eventually make him a superstar. While recording a series of moderately successful songs, Williams began a pattern of heavy drug and alcohol abuse. Upon moving to [[Alabama]], in an attempt to refocus both his creative energy and his troubled personal life, Williams began playing music with [[Southern rock]] musicians including [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Toy Caldwell]], and [[Charlie Daniels]]. ''[[Hank Williams Jr. and Friends]]'' (1975), often considered his watershed album, was the product of these then-groundbreaking collaborations.\n\nOn August 8, 1975, Williams was nearly killed while mountain climbing in southwestern [[Montana]]. While climbing [[List of mountains in Beaverhead County, Montana|Ajax Peak]] on the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|continental divide]] ([[Idaho]] border) west of [[Jackson, Montana|Jackson]], the snow beneath Williams collapsed and he fell almost {{convert|500|ft}} onto rock, causing multiple severe skull and facial fractures.<ref name=singfll>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8R9OAAAAIBAJ&pg=1923%2C4536621 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Singer injured in fall |date=August 11, 1975 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-01-11-williams-miner-visit_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA | work=USA Today | title=Hank Williams visits W.Va. mine survivor | date=January 11, 2006}}</ref> Williams spent two years recovering, re-learning how to talk and sing, and undergoing 17 surgeries to repair his skull and reconstruct his face. The accident was chronicled in the semi-autobiographical, made-for-television film ''[[Living Proof: The Hank Williams Jr. Story]]''. To hide his scars and disfigurement from the accident, Williams grew a beard and began wearing sunglasses and a [[cowboy hat]]. The beard, hat, and sunglasses have since become Williams' [[trademark look|signature look]].{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\nIn 1977, Williams recorded and released ''One Night Stands'' and ''The New South'', and worked closely with his old friend Waylon Jennings on the song \"Once and For All\".{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} In 1980, he appeared on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' during Season 5, along with the Shake Russell-[[Dana Cooper]] Band.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\n===Country music career===\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2008}}\n[[File:HankWilliamsJrCollage-1000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Williams performing at the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California, 2006]]\n\nIn 1976, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that Williams' \"mainstream country material has always been among [[Nashville Tennessee|Nashville]]{{'}}s best\".<ref>{{Cite web| title = Hank Williams Jr.: Hank William Jr. and Friends.

''[[Family Tradition (album)|Family Tradition]]'', ''[[Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound (album)|Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound]]'', ''[[Habits Old and New]]'', ''[[Rowdy (Hank Williams, Jr. album)|Rowdy]]'', ''[[The Pressure Is On]]'', ''[[High Notes]]'', ''[[Strong Stuff]]'', ''[[Man of Steel (album)|Man of Steel]]'', ''[[Major Moves (album)|Major Moves]]'', ''[[Five-O (album)|Five-O]]'', ''[[Montana Cafe]]'', and many others resulted in a long string of hits.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1992, Williams released 21 albums\u201418 studio albums and three compilations\u2014that were all certified at least [[Music recording certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Between 1979 and 1990, he enjoyed a string of 30 Top Ten singles on the Billboard Country charts, including eight No.&nbsp;1 singles, for a total of 44 Top Ten singles, including a total of 10 No.&nbsp;1 singles, during his career.\n\nIn 1982, he had nine albums simultaneously on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, all of which were original works and not compilations. In 1987\u201388, Williams was named Entertainer of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]]. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, he won the same award from the [[Academy of Country Music]]. The pinnacle album of his acceptance and popularity was ''[[Born to Boogie (album)|Born to Boogie]]''.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Williams Jr. became a country music superstar known for catchy anthems and hard-edged, rock-influenced country. During the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Williams' songs constantly flew into the number one or number two spots, with songs such as \"Family Tradition\", \"Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound\", \"Old Habits\", \"Ain't Misbehavin{{'\"}}, \"[[Born to Boogie (song)|Born to Boogie]]\", and \"My Name Is Bocephus\".\n\nThe hit single \"[[Wild Streak]]\" (1987) was co-written by [[Houston]] native [[Terri Sharp]], for which Williams and Sharp both earned gold records. In 1988, he released a Southern pride song, \"[[If the South Woulda Won]]\". The reference is to a notional Southern victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nHis 1989 hit \"[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]\" was a duet with his father created using electronic merging technology. The song was written by his father, and had been previously recorded with Hank Williams playing the guitar as the sole instrument. The music video for the song combined existing television footage of Hank Williams performing, onto which electronic merging technology impressed the recordings of Williams, which then made it appear as if he were actually playing with his father. The video was both a critical and commercial success. It was named ''Video of the Year'' by both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Williams would go on to win a [[Grammy Award]] in 1990 for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Vocal Collaboration]].\n\nHe is well known for his hit \"[[A Country Boy Can Survive]]\" and as the performer of the theme song for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', based on his 1984 hit \"[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight]]\". In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams' opening themes for ''Monday Night Football'' earned him four [[Emmy Award]]s. \n[[File:Hank Williams, Jr. (2006).jpg|thumb|Williams in 2006]]\nIn 2000, he provided the voice of Injun Joe in ''[[Tom Sawyer (2000 film)|Tom Sawyer]]''. In 2001, Williams Jr. co-wrote his classic hit \"A Country Boy Can Survive\" after 9/11, renaming it \"America Can Survive\". In 2004, Williams was featured prominently on ''CMT Outlaws''. In 2006, he starred at the Summerfest concert.\n\nHe has also made a cameo appearance along with [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Kid Rock]], and [[Charlie Daniels]] in [[Gretchen Wilson]]'s music video for the song \"[[All Jacked Up (song)|All Jacked Up]]\". He and Kid Rock also appeared in Wilson's \"[[Redneck Woman]]\" video. Hank also had a small part of Kid Rock's video \"Only God Knows Why\", and \"Redneck Paradise\".\n\nIn April 2009, Williams released a new single, \"Red, White & Pink-Slip Blues\", which peaked at number 43 on the country charts. The song was the lead-off single to Williams' album ''[[127 Rose Avenue]]''. The album debuted and peaked at number 7 on the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart. Also in July 2009, ''127 Rose Avenue'' was announced as his last album for Curb Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725202808/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 25, 2009|title=Hank Williams Jr. says new album is his last for Curb Records|last=Morris|first=Edward|work=[[Country Music Television]]|date=July 21, 2009|access-date=July 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Musical style ==\nAs a multi-instrumentalist, Williams' repertoire of skills includes guitar, bass guitar, [[upright bass]], [[steel guitar]], [[banjo]], [[Resonator guitar]], piano, keyboards, saxophone, [[harmonica]], [[fiddle]], and drums.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Williams began his recording career performing covers of his father's songs.

Active since 1948, he began his career as part of the duo [[Rusty and Doug]], along with his brother, [[Rusty Kershaw]]. He had an extensive solo career that included fifteen albums and singles that charted on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. He is also a member of the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]], being inducted in 2009.\n\n== Early life ==\nBorn in an unincorporated community called Tiel Ridge in [[Cameron Parish, Louisiana|Cameron Parish]], Kershaw spoke [[Louisiana French]] and did not learn English until the age of eight. By that time, he had mastered the fiddle, which he played from the age of five, and was on his way to teaching himself to play 28 instruments.<ref name = \"CMT\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kershaw_doug/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110529012212/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/kershaw_doug/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 29, 2011 |title=Doug Kershaw Bio |publisher=Cmt.com |access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref> His first gig was at a local bar, the Bucket of Blood, where he was accompanied by his mother on guitar.<ref name=\"LouisianaRocks\">{{cite book|last1=Aswell|first1=Tom|title=Louisiana Rocks!: The True Genesis of Rock and Roll|date=2013|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781455607839|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BSHTGsnI8skC&q=%22Doug+Kershaw%22+%2B+%22Bucket+of+Blood%22&pg=PA222|access-date=21 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nKershaw became interested in Cajun music during parties his parents would host on the family's [[houseboat]] in Louisiana, where he first heard Cajun bands playing the music.\n\n==\"Doug and Rusty\"==\nDoug grew up surrounded by [[Cajun music|Cajun]] fiddle and [[accordion]] music. After teaching his brother, Rusty, to play guitar, he formed a band, the Continental Playboys, with Rusty and older brother Nelson \"Peewee\" Kershaw in 1948.<ref name=\"LouisianaRocks\"/> With the departure of Peewee from the group, in the early 1950s, [[Rusty & Doug]] continued to perform as a duo.

D. \"Jay\" Miller]], owner of the [[Feature Records]] label, persuaded them to incorporate songs in English into their repertoire. In 1955, Doug and Rusty recorded their first single, \"So Lovely, Baby.\" Released on the Hickory label, the tune went to number 14 on the country music charts. Later that same year, Doug and Rusty were invited to become members of the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' cast. The Kershaws appeared at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] and became regular members of the Opry cast the following year.<ref name = \"CMT\" /><ref>{{cite web\n| title = Opry Timeline \u2013 1950s\n| url = http://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html\n| publisher = Opry.com\n| access-date = July 10, 2012\n| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190330032424/https://www.opry.com/about/Timeline_1950.html\n| archive-date = March 30, 2019\n| url-status = dead\n}}</ref>\nDespite the demands of his music career, Doug enrolled in [[McNeese State University]], in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], where he earned an [[undergraduate degree]] in Mathematics. At the peak of their early career, in 1958, Doug and Rusty both enlisted in the [[United States Army]]. They devoted their attention to the military until their discharge three years later.<ref name=\"LouisianaRocks\"/>\n\n== \"Louisiana Man\" and solo career ==\nAfter fulfilling their military obligation, the two brothers recorded \"[[Louisiana Man]]\", an autobiographical song that Doug had written while in the Army. The song not only sold millions of copies but over the years has come to be considered a standard of modern Cajun music.<ref name=\"Woodstra-p255\">{{cite book|last=Woodstra|first=Chris|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Experts' Guide to the Best Country Recordings|publisher=Backbeat Books|edition=1st|year=1997|page=255|isbn=978-0879304751}}</ref> The song was eventually [[cover version|covered]] by more than 800 artists.\n\nThere were three albums released by the duo on [[Hickory Records]], only one being released before they split up. The first was ''Rusty and Doug Sing Louisiana Man'' (LPM 103) in 1961. ''Kershaw (Genus Cambarus)'' (LPS 163) was released in 1972 and was a double LP. ''Louisiana Man'' (HR 4506) was the final Hickory album, released in 1974. By 1964, the brothers had elected to go their separate ways. It took another three years before Kershaw signed a songwriters' contract with BMI, in 1967.\n\nIn June 1969, Kershaw made his first network television appearance on the debut of the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash Show]]''.<ref name=\"LouisianaRocks\"/> After watching Kershaw's ''Johnny Cash Show'' performance as an eight-year-old boy, [[Mark O'Connor]] became inspired to learn to play the fiddle.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/11/19/mark-oconnors-art-fiddling-with-the-best/ad489226-573c-4281-b521-c7aff4a63e5a/ |title=Mark O'Connor's Art: Fiddling With The Best |author=Himes, Geoffrey |work=washingtonpost.com |access-date=5 May 2022 }}</ref> He capped the year with a week-long engagement at the New York City's [[Fillmore East]] as opening act for [[Eric Clapton]]'s [[Derek and the Dominos]]. While it seemed to many rock and pop fans that Kershaw had appeared out of nowhere, he had already sold more than 18 million copies of the records he had made in the early '60s with his brother, Rusty. \"Louisiana Man\" had been a Top 10 country hit in 1961 and its follow-up, \"Diggy Liggy Lo\", had done almost as well. His performance in front of a national audience led to [[Warner Bros.

He has released 10 studio albums on various labels, and has released 34 singles to country radio. Although he first charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in 1988, he did not reach the top 40 for the first time until 1992's \"Where Forever Begins\", which peaked at number 40. McCoy broke through two years later with the back-to-back number one singles \"[[No Doubt About It (Neal McCoy song)|No Doubt About It]]\" and \"[[Wink (song)|Wink]]\" from his platinum-certified album ''[[No Doubt About It (album)|No Doubt About It]]''. Although he has not topped the country charts since, his commercial success continued into the mid to late 1990s with two more platinum albums and a gold album, as well as six more top 10 hits. A ninth top 10 hit, the number 10 \"[[Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On]]\", came in 2005 from his self-released ''[[That's Life (Neal McCoy album)|That's Life]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nHubert Neal McGaughey Jr. was born on July 30, 1958, in [[Jacksonville, Texas]], to a Filipino-American mother and Irish-American father. Inspired by the variety of music that his parents listened to, which included [[Country music|country]], [[rock music|rock]], [[disco]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], McGaughey first sang in his church choir before founding an R&B band.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He later switched his focus to country music, performing in various bars and clubs in Texas. McGaughey, after attending [[junior college]] near his hometown, found work selling shoes at a shopping mall. In the early 1980s, he met his wife, Melinda, at the store.\n\nAfter winning a 1981 talent contest hosted by [[Janie Fricke]], he secured a spot as an opening act for [[Charley Pride]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Musical career==\nCrediting himself as Neal McGoy, a phonetic spelling of his surname,<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> he signed to the independent [[16th Avenue Records]] label in 1988.

His debut album, ''[[At This Moment (album)|At This Moment]]'', was released that year. None of the three singles made the country Top 40, although the lead-off single \"If I Built You a Fire\" was a Top 20 country hit in Canada. The other two releases were the [[At This Moment|title track]], a cover of [[Billy Vera]] and the Beaters' #1 Hot 100 hit from late 1986-early 1987,<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite book|editor1=Paul Kingsbury |editor2=Michael McCall |editor3=John W.

The album was also his first entry on [[Top Country Albums]], at No.&nbsp;58.\n\nWorking with producer [[Barry Beckett]] for the first time, McCoy released his breakthrough album, ''[[No Doubt About It (album)|No Doubt About It]]'', in 1994. The album produced his only number 1 country hits in its title track and \"[[Wink (song)|Wink]]\", both of which also made minor entries on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album also earned a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) and gold certification from the [[Canadian Recording Industry Association]] (CRIA). Its final single was \"[[The City Put the Country Back in Me]]\" at No.&nbsp;5.\n\n===Mid-Late 1990s===\n[[File:US Navy 050921-N-9274T-015 Three-time platinum album country music singer Neal McCoy performs at a USO concert for military personnel supporting Hurricane Katrina relief efforts.jpg|McCoy in 2005.|alt=Singer Neal McCoy singing into a microphone while looking upward.|200px|thumb|left]]\n''[[You Gotta Love That]]'', his fourth album, also received a platinum certification and it produced four singles: \"[[For a Change]]\", \"They're Playin' Our Song\" and the [[You Gotta Love That (song)|title track]] (respectively the first, second, and fourth singles) all peaked at No.&nbsp;3, while \"[[If I Was a Drinkin' Man]]\" reached No.&nbsp;16.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nMcCoy's [[Neal McCoy (album)|self-titled]] fifth studio album began a decline in his chart momentum. Although it was certified gold, ''Neal McCoy'' accounted for only one Top Ten hit in a cover of [[The Casinos]]' 1967 [[doo-wop]] single \"[[Then You Can Tell Me Goodbye]]\".<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/> The next two singles \u2014 \"Going, Going, Gone\" and \"That Woman of Mine\" \u2014 both peaked at No.&nbsp;35. Also in 1996, he sang guest vocals on the multi-artist charity single \"Hope\", the proceeds of which went to the [[Tony Martell|T. J. Martell Foundation]]'s cancer research.<ref>Whitburn, p. 193</ref> After \"That Woman of Mine\", he reached No.&nbsp;5 with \"[[The Shake (Neal McCoy song)|The Shake]]\", the only new song on his first ''[[Greatest Hits (Neal McCoy album)|Greatest Hits]]'' package, which reprised nine of his greatest hits to that point and also earned platinum certification.\n\n''[[Be Good at It]]'', his sixth studio release, followed in 1998. This was his first album since ''Where Forever Begins'' not to include a Top Ten hit. The title track, \"If You Can't Be Good, Be Good at It\", was the highest-peaking single release from it at No.&nbsp;22, followed by \"Party On\", which became his first single since 1992 to miss Top 40 entirely.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> After it came the No.&nbsp;29 \"Love Happens Like That.\" McCoy made a second appearance on a multi-artist charity single that same year, as one of several collaborators on \"One Heart at a Time\", a song written by [[Victoria Shaw (singer)|Victoria Shaw]] to benefit [[cystic fibrosis]] research.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bernarde|first=Scott R.|title=Stars of David: Rock'n'roll's Jewish Stories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XI4-VnSrEcAC&q=%22one+heart+at+a+time%22+%22olivia+newton+john%22&pg=PA329|year=2003|publisher=UPNE|isbn=1584653035|page=329}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, McCoy released his final album for Atlantic, ''[[The Life of the Party (album)|The Life of the Party]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> It only accounted for two singles: the [[Phil Vassar]] co-write \"I Was\" at No.&nbsp;37 and \"The Girls of Summer\" at No.&nbsp;42.

This single peaked at No.&nbsp;59.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> McCoy has performed every July since 1994 at The Hodag Country Festival in Rhinelander,Wisconsin.\n\n===2000\u201304: Warner Bros. Records and SEA Records===\nDue to the closure of Atlantic Records' Nashville division in mid-2000, McCoy's next album, ''[[24-7-365 (Neal McCoy album)|24-7-365]]'', was issued via [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]]. It included the singles \"Forever Works for Me (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday)\", \"Every Man for Himself\", and \"Beatin' It In\", at No.&nbsp;38, No.&nbsp;37, and No.&nbsp;41 respectively. In late 2000, he released a Christmas medley consisting of \"[[I'll Be Home for Christmas]]\" and \"[[Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas]]\", which reached number 74 based on seasonal airplay.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> After Giant closed as well, he moved again to [[Warner Bros.

His first single for his own label was \"[[Billy's Got His Beer Goggles On]]\", which reached the Top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in 2005. The song served as the lead-off to his 2005 album ''[[That's Life (Neal McCoy album)|That's Life]]''. Also included on the album were a cover of Charley Pride's \"[[You're My Jamaica]],\" (Charley Pride also appeared on the tune), and a studio version of \"Hillbilly Rap\", which he had performed in concert since the early 1990s.<ref name=\"goggles\"/> McCoy's next single release, \"The Last of a Dying Breed\", a song preceded by a spoken-word intro from [[United States Army]] general [[Tommy Franks]], peaked at 36.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\n[[Darryl Worley]] and the [[Drew Davis Band]] were signed to 903 as well. Worley released his 2006 album ''[[Here and Now (Darryl Worley album)|Here and Now]]'' on 903, which produced the top 40 hits \"Nothin' but a Love Thang\" and \"[[I Just Came Back from a War]]\". In May 2007, McCoy announced that the label had filed for bankruptcy and closed its doors.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Brooks |first=Dave |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3i6aa5bb36869cfa84fd7b70898175ddec |title=Billboard Business &#124; Billboard |website=Billboard.biz |access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref>\n\nIn Summer of 2007, Neal could be seen showing off his comedic chops on local TV commercials in the [[Waco, Texas]] market for Mike Craig Chevrolet Pontiac Buick in [[Marlin, Texas]].  The commercials continued for approximately one year.  In one of them Neal acts like a puppet in the hands of the branch manager of the Mike Craig dealership in [[Hillsboro, Texas]].\n\n===2008\u201313: ''The Very Best of Neal McCoy'', ''XII'', and ''Pride''===\nIn 2008, [[Rhino Records]] issued a compilation album entitled ''The Very Best of Neal McCoy''. This album reprised most of his biggest chart hits to that point, and it included the new recording \"Rednecktified\", which was released as a single but did not chart. Later that same year, he issued another single, \"For the Troops\", which also failed to chart. McCoy released a book titled ''New Mountain to Climb'' in 2011, which coincided with the release of a single of the same name.\n\nIn April 2011, McCoy signed with Blaster Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.websterpr.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=532:neal-mccoy-brings-his-multi-platinum-career-to-blaster-records&catid=62:neal-mccoy&Itemid=15 |title=HOME - Kirt Webster |website=Websterpr.com |date=2013-11-22 |access-date=2020-04-28}}</ref> He released his twelfth album, ''[[XII (Neal McCoy album)|XII]]'', for the label on March 6, 2012.

The album features guest appearances from [[Darius Rucker]], [[Trace Adkins]], and [[Raul Malo]] of [[The Mavericks]]. To promote the album, McCoy and Pride filmed a video for \"[[Kaw-Liga]]\", which was co-written and originally recorded by [[Hank Williams]] before Pride covered it in 1969. \nOn August 25, 2023, McCoy released a new single titled \"Used Car\".<ref name=\"weekly\">{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Deborah Evans|date=30 September 2013|title=Pride: In the Name of Love|journal=[[Country Weekly]]|volume=20|issue=39|pages=40\u201343|issn=1074-3235}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nMcCoy has been married to Melinda since 1980.

The two worked together for the next several years, eventually putting together a demo album called ''Proud of the Country''.<ref name=\"AllMusic\"/><ref>Tritt and Bane, p. 64</ref> Davenport sent the demo to Warner Bros. representatives in Los Angeles, who in turn sent the demo to their Nashville division, which signed Tritt in 1987.<ref name=\"stabler\">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Stambler|first2=Lyndon|last3=Laudon|first3=Grelon|title=Country music: the encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&q=%22travis+tritt%22&pg=PA500|year=1997|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-312-26487-9}}</ref> Davenport also helped Tritt find a [[talent manager]], Ken Kragen.

I'm an NRA ([[National Rifle Association of America]]) member, a life member as a matter of fact. I'm more for the belief of making the punishment tougher for the criminals to start with.

Tritt stated that beginning in 1993, he was awakened \"regularly\" by disembodied voices in a vacation cabin that he owned \u2013 the voices spoke in an unknown dialect. His wife, Theresa, eventually heard them as well. According to Tritt, \"Over the years, these voices started happening\non such a frequent basis that we were afraid to come up here.\" He also asserted that footprints once appeared in the carpet of the cabin, and imprints in the bedspread, that belonged to neither him nor his wife.\n\nThe show's host, Kim Russo, concluded that an African-American medicine man had been stabbed and beaten to death on the property, and the voices that Tritt was hearing belonged to the murderers' angry spirits. A title card in the program notes that \"On August 14, 1875, a group of men killed a '[[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] doctor' close to the land where Travis' cabin was built.\" Russo believed that the hoodoo doctor's spirit also lingered on the property because it found a \"kindred spirit\" in Tritt.<ref>[http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/the-haunting-of/season-4/episode-9] {{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3di96b|title=The Haunting Of S05E22 \u2013 Travis Tritt \u2013 video|website=Dailymotion.com|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Travis Tritt discography}}\n'''Studio albums'''\n*''Proud of the Country'' (1987)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Travistritt/status/866469859089162242|title=It was released.

Active from 1962 to 2019, Raven has recorded for several record labels, including [[ABC Records|ABC]], Dimension, [[Elektra Records|Elektra]], [[RCA Records|RCA]], [[Universal Records (1988)|Universal]], and [[Capitol Records]]. After multiple albums which yielded few hit songs, his greatest commercial success came between 1984 and 1990, during which time Raven achieved six number-one singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. These were \"[[I Got Mexico]]\", \"[[Shine, Shine, Shine]]\", \"[[I'm Gonna Get You (Billy Swan song)|I'm Gonna Get You]]\", \"[[Joe Knows How to Live]]\", \"[[A Letter to You|In a Letter to You]]\", and \"[[Bayou Boys]]\". Raven has a total of eighteen top-ten hits on that chart. Although his chart success diminished in the 1990s, Raven continued to record throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century. In addition to his own work, he has written singles for [[Don Gibson]], [[Randy Cornor]], [[Jeannie C. Riley]], [[Connie Smith]], and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] among others. Raven's music is defined by mainstream country, [[country pop]], [[Cajun music]], and [[reggae]], and he wrote a large number of his singles by himself or with [[Frank J. Myers]].\n\n==Biography==\nEdward Garvin Futch was born in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], on August 19, 1944.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/><ref name=\"Larkin2006\"/> He is the oldest of ten children, and his father worked as a truck driver.<ref name=\"pennies\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/112678145/ | title=Eddy Raven to perform at 'Pennies' | work=[[The Tennessean]] | date=December 15, 1982 | access-date=April 23, 2019 | author=Sandy Neese | pages=45}}{{subscription required}}</ref> Futch had originally considered a professional career in baseball, but chose not to after breaking his ankle.<ref name=\"gladys\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/229175341/ | title=Has the country boy caught up with the dream? | work=Daily World | date=January 18, 1981 | access-date=December 28, 2019 | author=Gladys L. deVillier | pages=C1}}{{Subscription required}}</ref> Growing up, he cited [[Cajun music]] as a musical influence, along with the [[country music]] sounds from popular radio broadcasts such as the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'', [[New Orleans blues]], and the new sounds of [[rock and roll]].

According to Raven, Bowen was the first record producer he encountered who was willing to let him record \"my music, not what the record company wanted me to cut.\"<ref name=\"pennies\"/> His only Elektra album, ''[[Desperate Dreams]]'', came out late that year. The album accounted for four chart singles on Hot Country Songs between 1981 and 1982: \"[[I Should've Called]]\", \"[[Who Do You Know in California]]\", \"[[A Little Bit Crazy]]\", and \"[[She's Playing Hard to Forget]]\", the last of which became his first top ten hit there. Raven wrote the first three by himself.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> At the time of the album's release, Raven said that many of his songs were inspired by situations that he had encountered while touring. Specifically, he stated that \"Who Do You Know in California\" was inspired by an extramarital affair he had heard of in [[Dallas, Texas]], but changed to being set in [[California]] because the latter fit the song's meter better. A concert review in ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' noted of Raven's style at the time that his style had potential for pop crossovers, while also stating that the song showed his lyrical skill by not resolving its central theme.<ref name=\"republic\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/121262933 | title=Eddy Raven is durable in any mode | work=[[The Arizona Republic]] | date=April 27, 1982 | access-date=April 23, 2019 | pages=D5}}{{subscription required}}</ref> ''Record World'' wrote of the album that Raven's \"commercial potential has not yet been reached\", while praising the vocal delivery on the singles.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Record-World/80s/81/RW-1981-10-10.pdf | title=Country album picks | journal=Record World | pages=55 | date=October 10, 1981}}</ref> Tom Roland of ''[[Allmusic]]'' thought that the album had more creative control from Raven than its predecessors did.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/desperate-dreams-mw0000857038 | title=''Desperate Dreams'' | work=Allmusic | access-date=April 23, 2019 | author=Tom Roland}}</ref> At the end of his contract with Elektra, Raven had a second album recorded but never released,<ref name=\"virgin\">{{cite book | title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music | publisher=Virgin Books | author=Colin Larkin | year=1998 | pages=349 | isbn=0-7535-0236-4}}</ref> although it did have one charted single in \"San Antonio Nights\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Once his contract ended, Raven chose to undergo a brief recording hiatus in order to determine the viability of his career. During this hiatus, he disassociated himself from his existing producers and managers and began writing songs with [[Frank J. Myers]], a songwriter who was also the guitarist and bandleader of his road band. After having success on the songwriting front, which included the title track of [[Tanya Tucker]]'s late-1982 album ''[[Changes (Tanya Tucker album)|Changes]]'', Raven was inspired to resume recording in 1984.<ref name=\"robert\"/>\n\n===1984-88: RCA Records===\n[[File:Frank Myers 190306-D-SW162-1180 (47257966602).jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Frank J.

The group originally formed as My Backyard and comprised [[Ronnie Van Zant]] (vocals), [[Gary Rossington]] (guitar), [[Allen Collins]] (guitar), [[Larry Junstrom]] (bass), and [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]] (drums). The band spent five years touring small venues under various names and with several lineup changes before deciding on \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" in 1968. The band released its first album, ''[[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)]]'', in 1973. By then, they had settled on a lineup that included bassist [[Leon Wilkeson]], keyboardist [[Billy Powell]], and guitarist [[Ed King]]. Burns left and was replaced by [[Artimus Pyle]] in 1974. King left in 1975 and was replaced by [[Steve Gaines]] in 1976. At the height of their fame in the 1970s, the band popularized the [[Southern rock]] genre with songs such as \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\" and \"[[Free Bird]]\". After releasing five studio albums and one live album, the band's career was abruptly halted on October 20, 1977, when [[Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash|their chartered airplane crashed]], killing Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and backup singer [[Cassie Gaines]], and seriously injuring the rest of the band.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie's brother, [[Johnny Van Zant]], as lead vocalist. They continued to tour and record with co-founder Rossington, Johnny Van Zant, and [[Rickey Medlocke]], who first wrote and recorded with the band from 1971 to 1972 before his return in 1996. Over the years, other founding members of the band have died either during\u2014or after\u2014their time in the band.

The Mods membership included J.R. Rice and Larry Steele. In early 1964, [[Ronnie Van Zant]] joined another local band, The Squires, that he soon renamed to Us. That year, at a local 'Battle of the Bands', Us performed against The Mods and won the competition. Van Zant, however, left Us shortly afterward. In the early summer of 1964, bassist [[Larry Junstrom]], drummer [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]], and guitarist [[Gary Rossington]] formed a trio called Me, You, and Him.{{efn|Rossington was the last to join\u2014at Burns' request.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}} }}\n\nLater in the summer of 1964, teenagers Van Zant, Rossington, and Burns all became acquainted while playing on rival baseball teams. The trio decided to jam together one afternoon after Burns was injured by a ball hit by Van Zant. They set up their equipment in the carport of Burns' parents' house and played [[The Rolling Stones]]' hit \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\". Liking what they heard, they immediately decided to form a band. Bassist Larry Junstrom rounded out the lineup. They soon approached guitarist Allen Collins to join the band just two weeks later, and he agreed to join.{{efn|Collins initially fled on his bicycle and hid in a tree at the sight of Van Zant pulling into his driveway.

Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was transferred to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving [[blues rock]] sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively \"southern\" sound through a creative blend of country, blues, and a slight British rock influence.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2267092?q=lynyrd+skynyrd&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1| title=Oxford Music Online| website=Oxfordmusiconline.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time.

Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label, which was to be distributed and supported by [[MCA Records]], and produced their first album. Wilkeson, citing nervousness about fame, temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions, playing on only two tracks. He rejoined the band shortly after the album's release at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover. To replace him, [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] guitarist [[Ed King]] joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part that Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in \"[[Simple Man (Lynyrd Skynyrd song)|Simple Man]]\"), and also contributed to the songwriting and did some guitar work on the album. After Wilkeson rejoined, King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar, allowing the band to replicate its three-guitar studio mix in live performances.

Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other's music and good friends; Young wrote the song \"[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]\" for the band, but they never recorded it.<ref>Simmons, p. 135.</ref> During their peak years, most of their records sold over one million copies, but \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was the only single to crack the top ten.<ref name=\"Butler, J.

Midway through the ''Nuthin' Fancy'' tour, guitarist Ed King abruptly left the band after a falling out with Van Zant. King's guitar roadie and Van Zant were arrested together and spent the night in jail. With his guitar roadie unavailable, King played that night's show with old strings that broke and caused his performance to be substandard, and Van Zant subsequently belittled him in front of his bandmates. King quit and returned home to Los Angeles, believing Van Zant had been responsible for his guitar roadie being in jail in the first place.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" />\n\n[[File:Crowd at Knebworth House - Rolling Stones 1976.jpg|thumb|A crowd of 120,000 fans at Knebworth House in 1976]]\nCollins and Rossington both had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous Van Zant/Collins composition \"[[That Smell]]\" \u2013 a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the \"Prince Charming\" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on [[Quaaludes]].

As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso requiring any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include Rossington and at least two of the other four surviving members from the pre-crash era, namely Wilkeson, Powell, King and Pyle.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.floridatrend.com/article/13369/lynyrd-skynyrd-unfynyshed-byzness |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd: Unfynyshed Byzness |newspaper=[[Florida Trend]] |accessdate= }}</ref> Following this rule, the band would have been forced to retire in 2001, but they have still continued to tour for another two decades.{{cn|date=June 2021}}\n\nThe band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991]]''.

Signed to [[Columbia Records]] in 1994, he made his debut that year with his gold-certified album ''[[Old Enough to Know Better]]''. Its title track \"[[Old Enough to Know Better (song)|Old Enough to Know Better]]\", which served as his debut single, reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. He released two more albums for Columbia Nashville: ''[[On a Good Night]]'' in 1996 and ''[[When the Wrong One Loves You Right (album)|When the Wrong One Loves You Right]]'' in 1998. Later albums were released on [[Monument Records]] and independently. In addition to \"Old Enough to Know Better\", Hayes reached top ten on the ''Billboard'' charts with \"[[I'm Still Dancin' with You]]\", \"[[Don't Stop (Wade Hayes song)|Don't Stop]]\", \"[[What I Meant to Say]]\", \"[[On a Good Night (song)|On a Good Night]]\", and \"[[The Day That She Left Tulsa (In a Chevy)]]\".\n\nIn 2003, he founded the duo [[McHayes]] with Mark McClurg. The duo charted one single on the country charts and recorded one unreleased album for the [[Universal South Records|Universal South]] label, ''Lessons in Lonely''. Hayes' career was briefly placed on hiatus due to a diagnosis of Stage IV [[colon cancer]], which went into remission in 2012. Hayes has continued to tour and record independently since.\n\n==Biography==\nWade Hayes was born and raised in [[Bethel Acres, Oklahoma]]. His father, Don Hayes, also a professional country musician, inspired him to begin playing music as well. Initially, Hayes had learned to play mandolin, but later switched to guitar after his father bought him one.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"oldies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Wade-Hayes.html |title=Wade Hayes biography |access-date=October 12, 2007 |work=Oldies.com}}</ref> When he was 11 years old, his family moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where his father signed with an independent record label. The label soon declared bankruptcy.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> The family returned to Oklahoma, where Wade later found work as a musician in his father's band.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nAlthough he attended three different colleges, Hayes dropped out of college in 1991 in pursuit of a career in country music, after seeing bluegrass musician [[Ricky Skaggs]] perform on the 1991 [[Country Music Association]] awards show.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Wade returned to Nashville, where he began recording demo tapes and writing his own material. Eventually, Hayes partnered with a songwriter named Chick Rains, who recommended him to Don Cook, a record producer who has produced albums for several country music artists, including [[Brooks & Dunn]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Musical career==\n\n===1994\u20131996: ''Old Enough to Know Better''===\nWith Cook's help, Hayes was signed to a record deal with [[Columbia Records]] in late 1994. The same year, Hayes' debut single, \"[[Old Enough to Know Better (song)|Old Enough to Know Better]]\", was released, and by early 1995, it peaked at Number One on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The single was followed by the release of Hayes' debut album, also titled ''[[Old Enough to Know Better]]'', which produced three additional Top Ten singles on the country music charts: \"[[I'm Still Dancin' with You]]\", \"Don't Stop\" and \"What I Meant to Say\", at No.&nbsp;4, No.&nbsp;10 and No.&nbsp;5 respectively. It was also certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for shipping 500,000 copies.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Also in 1995, Hayes was nominated for Top New Male Vocalist of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n===1996\u20131997: ''On a Good Night''===\n''[[On a Good Night]]'', Hayes' second album, was released via Columbia in 1996.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Although the album's lead-off single (which was the title track) peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the country charts, the second and third singles \u2014 \"Where Do I Go to Start All Over\" and \"It's over My Head\" \u2014 both failed to make Top 40. Nonetheless, the album was certified gold as well. Also included on this album was a cover of \"Undo the Right\", a song originally recorded by [[Willie Nelson]].\n\n===1997\u20131999: ''When the Wrong One Loves You Right''===\nIn 1997, Hayes also issued a cover of [[Glen Campbell]]'s song \"[[Wichita Lineman]]\" as the first single for a third album which was to have been titled ''Tore Up from the Floor Up''. This cover failed to reach Top 40, however, and the album was delayed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=HT&p_theme=ht&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAFEBA146F802BE&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Wade Hayes' \"Wrong\" Is Just Right for Him |access-date=November 21, 2008 |date=November 2, 1997|work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune}}</ref> It was followed with \"The Day That She Left Tulsa (In a Chevy)\", which reached No.&nbsp;5 on the country charts. After this song's release, Hayes's third album \u2013 by then re-titled ''[[When the Wrong One Loves You Right (album)|When the Wrong One Loves You Right]]'' \u2014 was issued, with the Glen Campbell cover omitted. \"The Day That She Left Tulsa\" was followed by \"When the Wrong One Loves You Right\", \"How Do You Sleep at Night\" (his final Top 40 hit at No.&nbsp;13), and finally, \"Tore Up from the Floor Up\". Hayes considered ''When the Wrong One Loves You Right'' as a more mature effort than his first two albums, with more of an emphasis on ballads than his previous two albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1473654/20030708/hayes_wade.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430131449/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1473654/20030708/hayes_wade.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 30, 2007 |title=CMT.com : Wade Hayes : Wade Hayes Shifts Gears |access-date=October 12, 2007 |work=CMT.com}}</ref>\n\n===2000\u20132001: ''Highways and Heartaches''===\nBy 2000, Hayes had switched from Columbia Records to [[Monument Records]].

He is the son of [[Country music|country]] singers [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Jessi Colter]]. In a career spanning three decades, Jennings has explored a variety of musical genres.\n\nJennings made his debut with the single \"4th of July\" of his 2005 album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' on [[Universal South Records|Universal South]], which peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard country charts.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Shooter Jennings - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/279176/shooter-jennings/chart?f=320|website = www.billboard.com|access-date = November 21, 2015}}</ref> Jennings has since followed with seven full-length studio albums: ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' (2006), ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' (2007), ''[[Black Ribbons]]'' (2009), ''Family Man'' (2012), ''The Other Life'' (2013) ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'' (2016), and ''Shooter'' (2018), in addition to a live album, a compilation, and numerous [[Extended play|EPs]].\n\n== Early life ==\nJennings was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on May 19, 1979. There are two different accounts regarding how he got his nickname \"Shooter.\" His mother cited her, and husband Waylon Jennings', love of western culture and cowboy art for inspiring the gun-derived moniker. But his father said he came up with the name when, moments after the newborn emerged from his mother's womb, the boy sprayed a nurse before anyone could put on his first diaper. \"I love my mom,\" says Jennings, \"but I like Dad's version better. And I believe it's true. He didn't make [stuff] like that up.\"\n\nHe lived the first few years of his life in a crib on his parents' tour bus surrounded by the likes of [[Johnny Cash]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. By age 5, he was playing drums. At 8 years old, he began taking piano lessons. He started playing guitar at 14 and on occasion he'd play percussion in his father's band.\n\nIn high school Jennings fronted an industrial rock band called KilRaven for his high school's talent show. In 2011, he released the KilRaven track \"Only You\" on the album \"Missed The Boat\".\n\nIn 1996, Jennings and his father recorded an album together. They called it ''Fenixon'' (a play on the words \"phoenix\" and \"son\") but could not find a label to distribute it.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Waylon and Son, Reunited on Disc|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122471459623460261|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = November 21, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Jim|last = Fusilli}}</ref> Some of the material was remastered and used for the album ''Waylon Forever''. The full ''Fenixon'' recording was finally released by Jennings' label Black Country Rock in 2014. Shooter Jennings is the uncle of William Harness, Professionally known as [[Struggle Jennings]].\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Shooterjennings(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|Jennings performing in 2009]]\n\n=== Stargunn ===\nIn 2001, Jennings left [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to seek his fortunes in [[Los Angeles]]. He assembled and performed with Stargunn, a [[rock music|rock]] band. The band featured Jennings on piano and lead vocals, Carter Falco, and Jonathan Boddie (later succeeded by Kevin Sciou) on guitar and background vocals, Curtis Roach on bass, and Lex Lipsitz on drums. Towards the end of 2001, Stargunn released their first album, ''The Only Way Up Is Down'', and toured with [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]], [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], Mark Ford and others in support of the album. That same year, ''[[Music Connection]]'' magazine listed Stargunn as one of the Hot 100 Unsigned Artists of 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Stargunn was featured on ''I've Always Been Crazy: A Tribute to Waylon Jennings'', and the soundtrack to the [[Vince Vaughn]] film ''[[Made (2001 film)|Made]]''. Shortly after, [[Touchstone Pictures]] licensed the song \"White Lines N Black Ties\" for the film ''[[The Crew (2000 film)|The Crew]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]]. Stargunn performed together for three years, built an avid following, and earned praise from the local music press. On March 30, 2003, Jennings dissolved Stargunn and began working on his solo career.\n\nAfter the band's breakup, Jennings was twice presented with the opportunity to front the hard rock supergroup [[Velvet Revolver]], but chose instead to pursue a solo career.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SHOOTER JENNINGS Claims He Was Offered VELVET REVOLVER Job Twice|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/shooter-jennings-claims-he-was-offered-velvet-revolver-job-twice/|website = BLABBERMOUTH.NET|date = March 19, 2009|access-date = November 21, 2015|language = en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Jennings' label Black Country Rock released Stargunn's debut album \"The Only Way Up Is Down\" on vinyl as part of Record Store Day.\n\n=== ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'' ===\nHe returned to Los Angeles in 2004 to begin working on new material. In 2005 Jennings signed his first recording contract, with [[Universal South Records]], releasing his debut album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' that same year.\n\n\"Put the \"O\" Back in Country\" produced his only entry on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in its lead-off single \"Fourth of July\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;22. The album version of this song features a cameo appearance by George Jones, who sings the chorus to his signature song \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" at the end; this guest appearance was removed from the song's radio edit. Despite the edit, Jones was credited on the Billboard charts. The album featured his new band The .357's, which consisted of Leroy Powell on guitar, Bryan Keeling on drums, [[Ted Russell Kamp|Ted Kamp]] on bass with [[Robby Turner]] on steel, and backing vocals by [[Bonnie Bramlett]].\n\nLater that year his song \"Busted In Baylor County\" was then featured in the 2005 film version of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', furthermore Jennings portrayed his father in the [[Johnny Cash]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Walk the Line]]'' alongside [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]]. His rendition of his father's song \"Long Way From Home\" was featured on the film's soundtrack.\n\n=== ''Electric Rodeo'' and ''The Wolf'' ===\nThough recorded before ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'', released on April 4, 2006,{{clarify|reason=is this the release date of Put the O Back in Country or the release date of Electric Rodeo?|date=April 2017}} ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' was released as Jennings's second solo album. Sonically, ''Electric Rodeo'' is louder, rawer, more upfront rock and roll than its predecessor.\n\n''Electric Rodeo'' was followed by ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' on October 23, 2007. The album varied from his previous records in that the .357s had opted for a decidedly 1970s feel to the instrumentals. It featured collaborations with [[Doug Kershaw]] and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], as well as a cover of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Walk of Life]]\".\n\nThat same year Jennings was featured on a duet of \"[[Good Hearted Woman (song)|Good Hearted Woman]]\" on [[Deana Carter]]'s sixth studio album, ''[[The Chain (Deana Carter album)|The Chain]]''.\n\n=== Departure from Universal ===\nIn 2009, Jennings, having issues with his label and wanting out of his four-album contract released his first compilation album, ''[[Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's]]''. The album featured four new tracks; live versions of \"Lonesome Blues\", and \"Daddy's Farm\", as well as covers of his father's \"Lonesome, Onry and Mean\", and the [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] song \"Living Proof\".\n\nAfter the release of ''Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's'', having fulfilled his four-album contract; Jennings parted ways with Universal records.\n\nOn March 23, 2009, Jennings took part in ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'', a television show in which two musicians are paired with one another and perform a small concert together for an intimate crowd. The episode paired Jennings with close friend and fellow musician [[Jamey Johnson]]. The evening's set list consisted entirely of duets, including a cover of \"[[Outlaw country|Outlaw]] Shit\" from the ''[[Waylon Forever]]'' album, two songs from Jennings' discography; \"God Bless Alabama\", \"It Ain't Easy\". As well as four songs from Johnson's album ''[[That Lonesome Song]]''; \"High Cost Of Living\", \"Mowing Down The Roses\", \"Between Jennings and Jones\" and \"In Color\".\n\n=== ''Black Ribbons'' ===\nHaving left Universal, Jennings changed the name of his backing band from The .357's to Hierophant. With the news that he and his band would be joining the likes of [[Paramore]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Jefree Star]], and various other popular rock bands on the 2009 [[Warped Tour]] it became apparent that Jennings next album would differ drastically from his previous efforts.\n\nIn February 2009, it was announced that the album would be titled ''[[Black Ribbons]]''. It was also announced that it would be a dystopian concept rock opera and that writer [[Stephen King]] would play a major role in the album as Will O' The Wisp.\n\nIt was released independently on March 2, 2010, through Black Country Rock Records, and although it was seen as a complete departure from his country sound, the album showed off the diversity as an artist and gained him much critical acclaim, as well as a brand new underground following.\n\nOn May 1, 2010, Jennings announced \"Black Ribbons: The Living Album\" on his Twitter account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ShooterJennings |title=Shooter Jennings (ShooterJennings) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=June 3, 2014 |access-date=August 4, 2014}}</ref> The \"Living Album\" includes the full studio record and live shows with [[Hierophant]] on a [[USB flash drive]] shaped like a tarot card.\nTowards the end of 2010, Jennings with the help of various other artists launched the \"XXX\" movement to help musicians who struggle to receive mainstream recognition.\n\nIn 2016, Jennings created and released a podcast series title \"Beyond the Black\" dealing with the topics and recording of [[Black Ribbons]]. The series is available on all music streaming formats as well as YouTube and the podcast's own website: [http://www.beyondthe.black www.beyondthe.black]\n\n=== ''Family Man'' ===\nIn 2011, along with childhood friend and master pianist Erik Deutsch, Jennings formed The Triple Crown, a new backing band featuring Erik Deutsch on piano, Tony Leone on drums, Jeff Hill on bass, Jon Graboff on pedal steel, Eleanor Whitmore on fiddle and Chris Masterson on lead guitar.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, having signed a record deal with [[E1 Music]], and with The Triple Crown along for the ride, Jennings returned to his country roots with the release of the album ''Family Man'', his first self-produced outing. The album was originally meant to contain eighteen tracks, but was instead split into two albums: ''Family Man'' and 2013's ''The Other Life''.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Jennings was featured in [[Bucky Covington]]'s debut single \"The Drinking Side of Country\" from the album ''Good Guys''.\n\nJennings took part in the February 25 Johnny Cash 80th Birthday Bash, in which he sang [[Cocaine Blues]] With [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Amy Nelson]]. The performance was released in a DVD/CD combo.\n\nIn October 2012 Jennings was one of six commentators for the Ovation mini-series ''Song By Song: Johnny Cash''.\n\n=== ''The Other Life'' ===\nWhile recording ''Family Man'', Jennings decided to cut the darker tracks from the album, and instead use them for the album's follow-up, ''The Other Life''.\n\n\"Five of these songs were recorded when we were doing ''Family Man'', and when we were deciding what to do with it we broke it up into two records. ''The Other Life'' is representative of the other side of the coin from ''Family Man'' and the way my life has been going in a lot of ways, At first we were going to call it ''The Outsider'', but once we got into the film we thought, 'Well, it's like a mirror, a dark mirror of what ''Family Man'' was.{{'\"}} - Jennings told TheBoot.com.\n\nJennings premiered the track \"Wild & Lonesome\" (featuring [[Patti Griffin]]) on the 4th season of the FX original series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''. Followed by the release of first official single from the album \"The White Trash Song\" (featuring [[Scott H. Biram]]) which premiered on RollingStones.com along with the announcement that the album would be accompanied by a film.\n\nThe album featured seven new songs, as well as two cover songs ([[Harry Nilsson]]'s \"Flying Saucer song\" and [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]]'s \"The White Trash song\") and \"Outlaw You\", which was put out in early 2012 as a digital release.\n\nJennings along with filmmaker Blake Judd released ''The Other Life'' film. Running at 32 minutes long, it utilizes six of the songs from the album as a sort of narration. The film is about a musician leaving his family to tour, but when he does so he finds the road is not the same, and becomes haunted by a mysterious woman. Throughout the film, the musician is forced to face his darker urges and deal with self-discovery, temptation, isolation and rebirth. The film closes with a short adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''.\n\nThe Other Life went on to win Best Short Film at the 2013 Horror Hound Festival.\n\nThe album was also heavily featured in the 2nd season of ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'', of which Shooter also appears, as himself.\n\n=== Black Country Rock Media ===\n{{main|Black Country Rock Media}}\nIn October 2013, Jennings announced the formation of his new label and multi-format recording company, Black Country Rock. Their initial releases included: a remastered release of the [[Waylon Jennings]] album ''[[Right for the Time]]'', two live albums (one from [[Jessi Colter]] titled ''Live from Cain's Ballroom'', and one from Jennings titled ''The Other Live''), as well as a recording of \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\" featuring vocals from both [[Jamey Johnson]] and Jennings. All four were released on vinyl, cassette, CD, as well as digitally.\n\n=== ''The Magic'' ===\nOn February 27, 2014, Jennings revealed he would be releasing a spoken word follow-up to Hierophant's 2010 album, ''[[Black Ribbons]]'', titled ''The Magic'', inspired by first story in the controversially interactive horror series thirteen.\n\nIn addition to ''The Magic'' Jennings also announced, that after nearly a decade of waiting, he would be releasing the 1995 collaborative album, ''Fenixon''.\n\nBoth projects were released during 2014's Record Store Day, and subsequently sold out.\n\n=== \"George/Giorgio\" releases ===\nTowards the end of May 2014, Jennings announced his intention to release two EP's later in the year. ''Don't Wait Up (for George)'' is a tribute to his close friend and mentor [[George Jones]], which was released in August 2014. Jennings' seventh studio album, ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'', was originally scheduled to be released in November 2014, but its release was delayed due to the sudden death of [[Jon Hensley (radio personality)|Jon Hensley]], Jennings' longtime manager and friend and Black Country Rock co-founder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/how-daft-punk-and-the-muppets-inspired-shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-6616503 |title=How Daft Punk and the Muppets Inspired Shooter Jennings' Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album |first=Daniel |last=Kohn |work=[[LA Weekly]] |publisher=[[Voice Media Group]] |date=February 23, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> A tribute to 1970s electronic-music pioneer and producer, [[Giorgio Moroder]], the album was released on February 26, 2016, and features guest vocals from [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]],<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6882805/shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-countach-david-bowie-interview |title=Shooter Jennings on Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album & How His David Bowie Cover 'Ended Up Meaning So Much More' |first=Chuck |last=Dauphin |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=February 19, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Brandi Carlile]],<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/shooter-jennings-enlists-marilyn-manson-brandi-carlile-for-countach-20160104 |title=Shooter Jennings Enlists Marilyn Manson, Brandi Carlile for 'Countach' |first=Andrew |last=Leahey |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=January 4, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Marilyn Manson]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/02/marilyn-manson-covers-the-hell-out-of-david-bowies-cat-people-listen/ |title=Marilyn Manson covers the hell out of David Bowie's \"Cat People\" \u2014 listen |first=Ben |last=Kaye |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=February 18, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> and [[Richard Garriott|Richard Garriott de Cayeux]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/neon-noir-meets-outlaw-country-shooter-jennings-tr-230314 |title=Neon noir meets outlaw country in Shooter Jennings' tribute to Giorgio Moroder |first=Mike |last=Vanderbilt |work=[[The A.V.

Together with [[Dave Cobb]], Jennings produced her 2018 album ''[[By the Way, I Forgive You]]'', which landed six Grammy nominations, including the all-genre Album and Song of the Year categories. It won in three categories: Americana album and both best American roots song and best American roots performance (for \"The Joke\").\n\nAfter reuniting with Dave Cobb, with whom Jennings made his first four records, Jennings, inspired by the 1984 country album ''[[Major Moves]]'' decided to shelve the album he had already been working on and instead go in a completely different direction with Cobb and make a fun, straight-ahead drinking, rockin' record. That album, titled ''Shooter'', was released in August 2018. \n \nThe following year Jennings teamed up with Brandi Carlile to produce [[Tanya Tucker]]'s 25th album, ''[[While I'm Livin']]''. The record, Tucker's first in 17 years, earned Grammys for Best Country Album and Best Country Song as well as Americana Award nominations for Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Artist of the Year.\n\n=== ''Over a Cocaine Rainbow'' ===\n\nIn late 2021 Jennings released \"Leave Those Memories Alone\", a tribute to his late friend and manager, Col. John Hensley. the track serves as the first single from the album ''Over a Cocaine Rainbow''. The record was initially slated for a 2017 release, but Jennings felt it was too \"dark and experimental\" to release at the time, given its subject matter and tone. Earlier that same year, Jennings released a remix of his \"From Here to Eternity\" track. The new version is dubbed the \"Goof the Floof Remix\", a reference to something Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] once said in an interview.\n\n=== Radio show ===\n\nSince 2005, Jennings has hosted \"Shooter Jennings' Electric Rodeo\" on [[Sirius XM]] Outlaw Country channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=SHOOTER JENNINGS DJS ON SIRIUS RADIO|url=http://www.countryweekly.com/news/shooter-jennings-djs-sirius-radio|website=Country Weekly|access-date=November 13, 2015}}</ref> The show's format primarily consists of country, rock, and outlaw music.

She has had three hit singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart with two of those singles charting in the [[Top 40]]. Reeves was formerly married to country music parodist and fellow recording artist [[Cledus T. Judd]] but she is now married to bluegrass singer and musician, Chris Davis.\n\n==Biography==\nJulie Reeves grew up in the city of [[Ashland, Kentucky]] then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1994 where she gained employment in the country music industry.  Some of her first assignments in Nashville were providing vocals in studio sessions and doing back-up studio work.  She also worked on [[demo recording]]s prior to signing with Capitol Records in 1997. She recorded her debut album with producer Scott Hendricks. After finishing the album, Hendricks left Capitol Records to head the newly formed [[Virgin Records Nashville]]. Julie became the flagship artist of Virgin Records Nashville and released her debut album ''It's About Time'' in 1999 and featured three hit singles which charted on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts including two Top 40 hits. She was featured on \"Shoulda Shut Up\", a song featuring [[Bill Engvall]]'s spoken-word comedy and a sung chorus. Reeves married country music parodist [[Cledus T. Judd]] and gave birth to a daughter, Caitlyn Rose, in 2004.  After giving birth, Reeves took a break from the country music business to raise her daughter.  She later divorced Judd and returned home to the Ashland, Kentucky area.  She is now married to bluegrass musician Chris Davis. The two of them have a son together, Rylan Wesley Davis, born November 5, 2011.\n\nBeginning in April 2013, Reeves became host of the ''Julie Reeves Live'' morning show on [[WDGG|93.7 The Dawg]] (WDGG), which once had the highest share of listeners of all radio stations in the Huntington, WV-Ashland, KY market.

He left RCA in 2006. This album was followed by ''Jeff Bates'' in 2008 on the independent [[Black River Entertainment]]. Bates' two RCA albums accounted for seven chart singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, of which three reached top 40: \"The Love Song\" (his highest, at No.&nbsp;8), \"I Wanna Make You Cry\" at No.&nbsp;23, and \"Long, Slow Kisses\" at No.&nbsp;17.\n\n==Biography==\n{{Expand section|more biographical info|date=November 2007}}\nJeff Bates was born in Bunker Hill, Mississippi, a community in Marion County.

Bates signed to [[RCA Records]] Nashville in 2003, releasing his debut single, \"[[The Love Song (Jeff Bates song)|The Love Song]]\" in December 2002. Peaking at No.&nbsp;8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, it was the first of three singles from his debut album ''[[Rainbow Man]]'',<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> which also produced a No.&nbsp;47 in its title track and a No.&nbsp;23 in \"I Wanna Make You Cry\". Bates co-produced the album with [[David Malloy]], [[Kenny Beard]], and [[Scott Hendricks]].\n\n===''Leave the Light On''===\nHis fourth single, \"[[Long, Slow Kisses]]\", was a re-recording of a cut from his debut album. This re-recording was the third Top 40 hit of his career, peaking at No.&nbsp;17 in 2005. It was also the first of four singles from his second album, ''[[Leave the Light On (Jeff Bates album)|Leave the Light On]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> However, none of the other three singles from this album \u2014 \"Good People\", \"No Shame\" and \"One Second Chance\" \u2014 reached Top 40, (However, \"No Shame\" did reach top 40 at No.&nbsp;40 for Mediabase, which is used by Bob Kingsley's \"Country Top 40\" show), and Bates was dropped from RCA's roster.\n\n===''Jeff Bates''===\nHe signed to [[Black River Entertainment]] in 2008 and released his [[Jeff Bates (album)|self-titled]] third album. The album's first three singles were \"Don't Hate Me for Lovin' You\", \"Riverbank\", and \"One Thing\".\nIn January 2009 he released his first Christmas single \"That's What Christmas Is\" with [[Jimmy Fortune]] of [[The Statler Brothers]] fame singing background vocals.\n\n===''One Day Closer''===\nJeff's second and first EP for Black River, \"One Day Closer\" was released February 15, 2011.\n\n==Personal life==\nAfter signing a contract with Warner-Chappell Publishing, Bates developed a methamphetamine addiction in late 1999. To feed the drug habit, he sold everything he owned and then resorted to stealing, including a guitar from his friend Kenny Beard.

The tour lasted three full years, constantly being extended after an initial run of 20 shows.\n\nIn 2004, he launched a new television series called ''[[Blue Collar TV]]'' on [[The WB]]. He served as [[executive producer]] and starred alongside Blue Collar Comedy Tour-mates Larry the Cable Guy and Bill Engvall. (Ron White made occasional guest appearances.) On Larry the Cable Guy's website, he posted that the show was canceled on October 17, 2005, by The WB. Reruns of ''Blue Collar TV'' continued until the network merged with [[UPN]] to form [[The CW]]. In 2006, Foxworthy resurrected the ''Blue Collar TV'' format on [[Country Music Television]] (CMT) with ''Foxworthy's Big Night Out''. The show began airing in the fall and was canceled after one season of 12 episodes.\n\n===Books===\nFoxworthy has authored several books, including ''You Might Be a Redneck If...''

Between 1990 and 1999, he had his greatest chart success recording for [[Universal Music Group Nashville]]'s [[MCA Records|MCA]] and [[Decca Records|Decca]] branches, with a total of eight albums between those two labels. During this timespan, Chesnutt also charted twenty top-ten hits on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, of which eight reached number one: \"[[Brother Jukebox]]\", \"[[I'll Think of Something]]\", \"[[It Sure Is Monday]]\", \"[[Almost Goodbye (song)|Almost Goodbye]]\", \"[[I Just Wanted You to Know]]\", \"[[Gonna Get a Life]]\", \"[[It's a Little Too Late (Mark Chesnutt song)|It's a Little Too Late]]\", and a cover of [[Aerosmith]]'s \"[[I Don't Want to Miss a Thing]]\". His first three albums for MCA (''[[Too Cold at Home]]'', ''[[Longnecks & Short Stories]]'', and ''[[Almost Goodbye]]'') along with a 1996 ''[[Greatest Hits (Mark Chesnutt album)|Greatest Hits]]'' package issued on Decca are all [[music recording sales certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA); 1994's ''[[What a Way to Live]]'', also issued on Decca, is certified gold. After a self-titled album in 2002 on [[Columbia Records]], Chesnutt has continued to record predominantly on independent labels.\n\nChesnutt is known for his [[neotraditionalist country]] and [[honky-tonk]] influences, with frequent stylistic comparisons to [[George Jones]]. He has recorded several cover songs as both singles and album cuts, including covers of [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[John Anderson (singer)|John Anderson]], [[Don Gibson]], [[Conway Twitty]], and [[Charlie Rich]]. Artists with whom he has collaborated include Jones, [[Tracy Byrd]], [[Vince Gill]], and [[Alison Krauss]]. [[Mark Wright (record producer)|Mark Wright]] produced all but one of his albums released in the 1990s, while his work since 2005 has been produced by [[Jimmy Ritchey]].

After a disc jockey at [[KPLX]] in [[Dallas]], Texas, began playing \"Mrs. Steven Rudy\", another track from the album, other nearby stations soon followed suit.

He released two albums for the label (2004's ''[[Trent Willmon (album)|Trent Willmon]]'' and 2006's ''[[A Little More Livin']]'') and charted six singles on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts before exiting Columbia in 2006. A third album, ''[[Broken In]]'', was released on the independent Compadre label in February 2008.\n\n==Musical career==\nWillmon was born in [[Amarillo, Texas]]<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p668804|pure_url=yes}} |title=Trent Willmon biography |accessdate=January 1, 2008 |last=Ruhlmann |first=William |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> and was raised on a ranch near [[Afton, Texas]]. After 2 years at South Plains College as an Animal Science major, he left to pursue music, playing with several Texas- based bands, including playing bass for bluegrass legend Karl Shiflett. In 1999 he signed a staff writing deal with SeaGayle Music. One of his first cuts as a songwriter was \"It Doesn't Mean I Don't Love You\", which he co-wrote with [[Bobby Pinson]] and Jeremy Spillman. It was recorded by the duo [[McHayes]] (which comprised 1990s country singer [[Wade Hayes]] and fiddler Mark McClurg), and reached 41 on the country charts in 2003.\n\nWillmon signed with [[Columbia Records]] in 2004. His [[Trent Willmon (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released that year, and it produced four singles. The first of these was \"Beer Man\", which peaked at 30 on the country charts. Following it were \"Dixie Rose Deluxe's Honky-Tonk, Feed Store, Gun Shop, Used Car, Beer, Bait, BBQ, Barber Shop, Laundromat\" at 36, \"Home Sweet Holiday Inn\" at 49, and finally \"The Good Life\" at 38.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|year=2008|page=469|isbn=0-89820-177-2}}</ref> A second album, ''[[A Little More Livin']]'', followed in 2006. Although its lead-off single \"On Again Tonight\" became his highest chart entry at 27, the follow-up \"So Am I\" peaked at 59, and Willmon exited Columbia's roster.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n\nWillmon signed with [[Compadre Records]] in 2007. His third album, ''[[Broken In]]'', was released on February 26, 2008.<ref name=\"weekly\"/> The album produced three singles in \"There Is a God\", the title track, and \"Cold Beer and a Fishing Pole\", though none of these entered the charts. In early 2008, he also made his acting debut in the film ''Palo Pinto Gold'', a cowboy film also starring [[Roy Clark]] and [[Mel Tillis]].<ref name=\"weekly\">{{cite journal |last=Neal |first=Chris |author2=Larry Holden  |date=January 14, 2008 |title=The Scoop: Trent Goes to the Movies |journal=[[Country Weekly]] |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=14 }}</ref><!--Country Weekly post-dates its issues--> Willmon also co-wrote [[Montgomery Gentry]]'s 2009 single \"[[Back When I Knew It All (song)|Back When I Knew It All]]\" and [[Steel Magnolia]]'s 2010 single \"[[Keep On Lovin' You]]\".\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+List of studio albums, with selected details and peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Details\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br><ref name=\"Allmusic albums\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p668804|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( Trent Willmon > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums )))|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=April 4, 2010}}</ref>\n! width=\"40\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br><ref name=\"Allmusic albums\" />\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat.]]<br><ref name=\"Allmusic albums\" />\n! width=\"40\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]<br><ref name=\"Allmusic albums\" />\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Trent Willmon (album)|Trent Willmon]]''\n| \n* Release date: October 12, 2004\n* Label: [[Columbia Records|Columbia Nashville]]\n| 22\n| 150\n| 5\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[A Little More Livin']]''\n| \n* Release date: June 13, 2006\n* Label: Columbia Nashville\n| 19\n| 70\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Broken In]]''\n| \n* Release date: February 26, 2008\n* Label: [[Compadre Records]]\n| 33\n| \u2014\n| 7\n| 30\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Little Ol' Cafe''\n| \n* Release date: October 6, 2010\n* Label: Feed Store Records\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"10\" style=\"font-size:85%\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of singles, with selected peak chart positions\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Single\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"|Chart positions\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"|Album\n|-\n!width=\"50\"|<small>[[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]</small><br /><ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n!width=\"50\"|<small>[[Bubbling Under Hot 100|US Bubbling]]</small><br /><ref name=\"whitburn\"/>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2004\n| \"Beer Man\"\n| align=\"center\"| 30\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n| rowspan=\"4\"| ''Trent Willmon''\n|-\n| \"[[Dixie Rose Deluxe's Honky-Tonk, Feed Store, Gun Shop, Used Car, Beer, Bait, BBQ, Barber Shop, Laundromat|Dixie Rose Deluxe's Honky-Tonk, Feed Store, Gun Shop,<br />Used Car, Beer, Bait, BBQ, Barber Shop, Laundromat]]\"\n| align=\"center\"| 36\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2005\n| \"Home Sweet Holiday Inn\"\n| align=\"center\"| 49\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n|-\n| \"Population 81\"\n| align=\"center\"| 38\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2006\n| \"[[On Again Tonight]]\"\n| align=\"center\"| 27\n| align=\"center\"| 24\n| rowspan=\"2\"| ''A Little More Livin'''\n|-\n| \"So Am I\"\n| align=\"center\"| 59\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n|-\n| 2007\n| \"[[There Is a God]]\"\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n| rowspan=\"3\"| ''Broken In''\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2008\n| \"Broken In\"\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n|-\n| \"Cold Beer and a Fishin' Pole\"\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n| align=\"center\"| \u2014\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+List of music videos\n! scope=\"col\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\"| Video\n! scope=\"col\"| Director\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2004\n| \"Beer Man\"\n| Brent Hedgecock\n|-\n| \"Dixie Rose Deluxe's\u2026\"\n| Traci Goudie\n|-\n| 2005\n| \"Home Sweet Holiday Inn\"\n| Deb Haus\n|-\n| 2006\n| \"On Again Tonight\"\n| Sam Erickson\n|-\n| 2007\n| \"There Is a God\"\n| Andy Wehrspan\n|-\n| 2008\n| \"Broken In\"\n| The Brads\n|-\n| 2009\n| \"Live from Gilley's\"\n| Texas Roadhouse Live\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Willmon, Trent}}\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Columbia Records artists]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Amarillo, Texas]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Texas]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

He has released 16 studio albums, with three RIAA platinum certifications and two gold certifications among them. More than 25 singles have entered the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including his only number one hit \"[[She Don't Know She's Beautiful]]\" and 10 more Top 10 hits: \"[[Cadillac Style]]\", \"[[Anywhere but Here (song)|Anywhere but Here]]\", \"[[Haunted Heart (Sammy Kershaw song)|Haunted Heart]]\", \"[[Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer]]\", \"[[I Can't Reach Her Anymore]]\", \"[[National Working Woman's Holiday]]\", \"[[Third Rate Romance]]\", \"[[Meant to Be (Sammy Kershaw song)|Meant to Be]]\", \"[[Vidalia (song)|Vidalia]]\", and \"[[Love of My Life (Sammy Kershaw song)|Love of My Life]]\".\n\nKershaw tried to enter politics, running as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate for [[lieutenant governor of Louisiana]] in 2007 and 2010. In 2007 he finished third in the jungle primary, but Democrat [[Mitch Landrieu]] won strongly in the general election. In 2010 he carried more parishes than any other candidate, but placed third. He endorsed Republican [[Jay Dardenne]], Secretary of State, for the position, who won the general election.\n\n==Early life and career==\nSamuel Paul Cashat was born in the [[Acadiana]] town of [[Kaplan, Louisiana|Kaplan]], located in South Louisiana. He is the third cousin of singers [[Rusty and Doug|Rusty]] and [[Doug Kershaw]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> When he was 11, his grandfather gave him his first [[guitar]]. But his father died that year, so Sammy started to work a variety of day jobs while playing [[Roadhouse (facility)|roadhouse]]s at night to support his family. He began performing in Acadiana with Louisiana legend J.B. Pere. At the age of 12, Kershaw was playing in a variety of honky-tonks and beer joints, and when he was 14 he met [[George Jones]], his lifelong idol.<ref name=\"villages-news.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.villages-news.com/sammy-kershaw-tells-tales-battling-booze-bankruptcy-lorrie-morgan |title=Sammy Kershaw tells tales of battling booze, bankruptcy and Lorrie Morgan |website=Villages-News.com|date=28 June 2016 |access-date=2016-08-25}}</ref> Subsequently, he opened shows for [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price]], [[Merle Haggard]], and [[George Jones]] while still barely into his teens. When the pressures of growing up fast took their toll in the form of a serious [[drug abuse|drug]] and [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] problem, he quit his bad habits in 1988. He took a break from the music world to work as a remodeling supervisor at [[Wal-Mart]].\n\n==Musical career==\nOne of Kershaw's demonstration tapes made its way to [[Mercury Records]], which released his debut album ''[[Don't Go Near the Water (album)|Don't Go Near the Water]]'' in 1991. This album was certified [[platinum album|platinum]] by the [[RIAA]], and it produced four hit singles. The lead-off, \"[[Cadillac Style]]\", went to No.&nbsp;3 in late 1991 and early 1992, followed by the [[Don't Go Near the Water (Sammy Kershaw song)|title track]] at No.&nbsp;12, \"[[Yard Sale (song)|Yard Sale]]\" at No.&nbsp;17, and \"[[Anywhere but Here (song)|Anywhere but Here]]\" at No.&nbsp;10. Kershaw was initially reluctant to release \"Cadillac Style\" because he felt that it was not suitable for his style; however, his co-producer, [[Buddy Cannon]], convinced him to give the song a chance. Kershaw's often [[honky-tonk]] material and singing voice led to critical comparisons to [[George Jones]], and he covered one of Jones's early singles, \"What Am I Worth\", on his debut as well.\n\nIn 1993, Kershaw received an initial nomination for the [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Vocalist of the Year]]. He was nominated alongside [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Tracy Lawrence]], [[Chris LeDoux]] and [[Collin Raye]]; Cyrus, Lawrence and Raye would make the final three.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/90s/1993/CB-1993-02-13.pdf|title=ACM Announces Nominations|magazine=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]|pages=21|date=February 13, 1993}}</ref>\n\nKershaw's second album, ''[[Haunted Heart (Sammy Kershaw album)|Haunted Heart]]'', followed in 1993. Its lead-off single, \"[[She Don't Know She's Beautiful]]\", became his only Number One hit, in April of that year. Following it were the [[Haunted Heart (Sammy Kershaw song)|title track]], the [[Dennis Linde]]\u2013penned \"[[Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer]]\", and \"[[I Can't Reach Her Anymore]]\", all of which hit the Top 10 as well. Although Kershaw had been told by others that radio audiences might not identify with the subject matter on \"Queen of My Double-Wide Trailer\", Kershaw wanted to release the song because he had an experience similar to its story line. Like his debut, ''Haunted Heart'' was a platinum album.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In mid-1994, Kershaw also covered the [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] song \"[[I Know a Little]]\" on the tribute album ''[[Skynyrd Frynds]]'', which included country music covers of Skynyrd songs. Also in 1994, Kershaw contributed the song \"[[Fire and Rain (song)|Fire and Rain]]\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n''[[Feelin' Good Train]]'' was Kershaw's third album, released later in 1994. This album also produced four hits, including two consecutive No.&nbsp;2's in \"[[National Working Woman's Holiday]]\" and \"[[Third Rate Romance]]\" (the latter a cover of the [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]] hit from 1975),<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> with the No.&nbsp;27 \"[[Southbound (Mac McAnally song)|Southbound]]\" and No.&nbsp;18 \"[[If You're Gonna Walk, I'm Gonna Crawl]]\" following in 1995. The album included a duet with George Jones on \"Never Bit a Bullet Like This\", which had previously been released on Jones's 1993 album ''[[High-Tech Redneck]]''. ''Feelin' Good Train'' was certified gold. It was followed by a Christmas album, ''[[Christmas Time's A-Comin' (album)|Christmas Time's A-Comin']]'', and Kershaw's first greatest-hits package, ''Greatest Hits, Volume 1'', both in 1995. The latter produced a No.&nbsp;47 single in \"Your Tattoo\" (written by [[Kostas Lazarides|Kostas]] and [[Jack Tempchin]]), the first single of Kershaw's career not to reach the Top 40.\n\n===Mid-late 1990s===\nKershaw's fourth studio album, the gold-certified ''[[Politics, Religion and Her]]'', was issued in 1996. It produced Top 10 hits in \"[[Meant to Be (Sammy Kershaw song)|Meant to Be]]\" and \"[[Vidalia (song)|Vidalia]]\", the latter of which Kershaw also considered a risky song, saying, \"If radio will play this one more than twice\u2014so people can get the story and learn what a [[Vidalia onion]] is\u2014it'll be a smash.\" These songs were followed by \"[[Fit to Be Tied Down (Sammy Kershaw song)|Fit to Be Tied Down]]\" and the [[Politics, Religion and Her (song)|title track]], both of which hit the Top 30. Also included on ''Politics, Religion and Her'' were covers of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis, Tennessee]]\" and [[Sammy Johns]]' \"[[Chevy Van (song)|Chevy Van]]\". The same year, Kershaw briefly took ownership of a [[NASCAR]] Busch series team (now Xfinity Series).\n\n''[[Labor of Love (Sammy Kershaw album)|Labor of Love]]'' was issued later in 1997 as his fifth album. Unlike his previous albums, this one was predominantly composed of ballads.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> It produced a No.&nbsp;2 (and final US Top 10 hit) in \"[[Love of My Life (Sammy Kershaw song)|Love of My Life]]\", and although none of the other three singles (\"[[Matches (Sammy Kershaw song)|Matches]]\", \"[[Honky Tonk America]]\" and \"[[One Day Left to Live]]\") reached higher than No.&nbsp;22, the album was nonetheless certified platinum. His next album, ''[[Maybe Not Tonight]]'', brought a Top 20 duet with [[Lorrie Morgan]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nKershaw stated that he enjoyed working with Morgan on the song, telling ''[[Country Weekly]]'' magazine, \"I knew our vocals would match up\u2026 Plus, we have fun together. We're friends and we have been friends for a long time.\" \"[[Maybe Not Tonight (song)|Maybe Not Tonight]]\" was commercially less successful than its predecessors, however, and it became the first album of Kershaw's career not to achieve an RIAA certification. Following \"Maybe Not Tonight\" were the singles \"[[When You Love Someone (Sammy Kershaw song)|When You Love Someone]]\" and \"[[Me and Maxine]]\", both of which peaked in the thirties. \"[[Louisiana Hot Sauce]]\", the final release from ''[[Maybe Not Tonight]]'', was also the first single of his career not to enter the charts.\n\nIn 2000, Kershaw released an album of [[cover song]]s, ''[[Covers the Hits]]''. This album comprised 10 cover songs that Kershaw had recorded in his career. Some of the songs on it, such as the single \"Third Rate Romance\", were previously found on Kershaw's studio albums, while others came from various tribute albums (such as ''Skynyrd Frynds'') to which he had contributed. ''Covers the Hits'' also included a rendition of [[Dr. Hook]]'s \"Little Bit More\", a previously unreleased cover which Kershaw had recorded during the sessions for ''Labor of Love''.\n\n===2000s===\nBy 2001, Kershaw and Morgan had married. The two recorded a vocal duet album in 2001 entitled ''[[I Finally Found Someone (Lorrie Morgan and Sammy Kershaw album)|I Finally Found Someone]]'' (the [[I Finally Found Someone|title track]] being a cover of the [[Barbra Streisand]]/[[Bryan Adams]] duet). This album was less successful commercially, with its only Top 40 hit being the No. 39 \"He Drinks Tequila\". Shortly afterward, a second 'greatest hits' package was released, and Kershaw left Mercury's roster.\n\nIn 2003, Kershaw signed to [[Audium Entertainment]] to release the album ''[[I Want My Money Back]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> This album produced a No. 33-peaking in its [[I Want My Money Back (song)|title track]], but the second single \"I've Never Been Anywhere\" fell short of the Top 40. The third and final single, \"Beer, Bait & Ammo\" (which failed to chart), was previously recorded and written by [[Kevin Fowler]] on his 2000 debut album [[Beer, Bait & Ammo|of the same name]], and would later be recorded by [[Mark Chesnutt]] on his 2004 album ''[[Savin' the Honky Tonk]]''.\n\nAfter Audium closed its Nashville division, Kershaw signed to [[Category 5 Records]], then a newly established independent label, in 2006. His first release for the label and first chart single in three years, \"Tennessee Girl\", fell three spaces short of the Top 40 that year. It was the first release from his 2006 album ''[[Honky Tonk Boots]]''. The album's only other single, a cover of [[Mel McDaniel]]'s Number One hit \"[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]\", failed to chart, and financial difficulties caused the label to close in 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Sammy Kershaw was inducted into The [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]] in honor of his career achievements and was also inducted into the Louisiana Songwriters Association Hall Of Fame in 2010.\n\nKershaw's first single in two years, \"[[Real People (song)|Real People]]\", was released in late 2008 in the Boomerville/Big Hit label. However, the single failed to chart. His tenth studio album, ''[[Better Than I Used to Be]]'', was released on August 31, 2010.\n\n===Political activity===\nKershaw had become increasingly interested in politics. On June 13, 2007, he announced his candidacy for [[lieutenant governor]] of Louisiana in the October 20 [[jungle primary]]. The position was held by the incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], [[Mitch Landrieu]]. Kershaw also faced a second Republican candidate, [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] Gary Beard of [[Baton Rouge]], an [[engineer]] first elected to the State House in a 2001 [[special election]]. Kershaw finished second with 30 percent of the vote, but Landrieu won re-election with a majority on the first ballot.\n\nWatching his state embroiled in the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Gulf Oil Spill]] in April 2010, Kershaw, a Lafayette resident, became the official spokesperson for Protect Our Coastline, a non-profit dedicated to providing relief to the fishermen and shrimpers affected most by the spill.\n\nOn August 28, 2010, Kershaw announced his second bid for lieutenant governor in the October 2 [[special election]] to replace Mitch Landrieu, who left office in May after being elected [[mayor]] of [[New Orleans]]. Kershaw's intraparty rivals included  state Republican chair Roger F. Villere Jr. of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]], [[St. Tammany Parish]] president Kevin Davis of [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]], and Secretary of State [[Jay Dardenne]] of Baton Rouge. Kershaw polled 19 percent and carried 31 of the 64 parishes (more than any other candidate).<ref>{{cite news\n|url = http://www.bayoubuzz.com/buzz/latest-buzz/item/520-louisiana-lt-governors-race-dardenne-vs-fayard-is-gender-party-region-showdown\n|newspaper = BayouBuzz News\n|first = Christopher \n|last = Tidmore \n|title = Louisiana Lt.

During his Blind Audition, Boyd sang \"[[The Whiskey Ain't Workin']]\" by [[Travis Tritt]] and [[Marty Stuart]].  Two coaches ([[Blake Shelton]] and [[Pharrell Williams]]) turned around.

His childhood was troubled after the death of his father, and he was incarcerated several times in his youth. After being released from [[San Quentin State Prison]] in 1960, he managed to turn his life around and launched a successful country music career. He gained popularity with his songs about the working class; these occasionally contained themes contrary to the anti\u2013[[Vietnam War]] sentiment of some popular music of the time. Between the 1960s and the 1980s he had 38 number-one hits on the US country charts, several of which also made the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' all-genre singles chart]]. Haggard continued to release successful albums into the 2000s.\n\nHe received many honors and awards for his music, including a [[Kennedy Center Honors|Kennedy Center Honor]] (2010); a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] (2006); a [[BMI Awards|BMI Icon Award]] (2006);<ref name=bmiawards /> and induction into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1977);<ref name=nashvillehof>{{cite web|url=http://nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com.s164288.gridserver.com/Site/inductee?entry_id=2344|title=Merle Haggard|website=[[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]]|access-date=April 9, 2016|quote=Induction year: 1977|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150727055941/http://nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com.s164288.gridserver.com/Site/inductee?entry_id=2344|archive-date=July 27, 2015}}</ref> [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] (1994)<ref name=countrymusichof>{{cite web|url=http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-haggard |title=Full List of Inductees |publisher=Country Music Hall of Fame |date=2010 |access-date=April 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331231437/http://countrymusichalloffame.org/full-list-of-inductees/view/merle-haggard |archive-date=March 31, 2013}}</ref> and [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]] (1997).<ref name=okmusichof>{{cite web|url=http://www.omhof.com/Inductees/tabid/56/ItemID/54/Default.aspx|title=Inductees|website=Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame|access-date=April 16, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419195117/http://www.omhof.com/Inductees/tabid/56/ItemID/54/Default.aspx|archive-date=April 19, 2013}}</ref> He died on April 6, 2016\u2014his 79th birthday\u2014at his ranch in [[Shasta County, California]], having recently suffered from [[Classification of pneumonia#Double pneumonia (bilateral pneumonia)|double pneumonia]].<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news|last=Friskics-Warren|first=Bill|title=Merle Haggard, Country Music's Outlaw Hero, Dies at 79|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/arts/music/merle-haggard-country-musics-outlaw-hero-dies-at-79.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 6, 2016|access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | audio1 = [https://freshairarchive.org/segments/country-music-legend-merle-haggard-1 Country Music Legend Merle Haggard], interviewed by [[Terry Gross]] on ''[[Fresh Air]]'', 42:14, August 14, 1995.<ref name=\"Fresh Air\">{{cite interview |last=Haggard |first=Merle |interviewer=Terry Gross |title=Country Music Legend Merle Haggard |url=https://freshairarchive.org/segments/country-music-legend-merle-haggard-1 |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[WHYY-FM|WHYY]] ([[NPR]]) |date=August 14, 1995 |access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nHaggard's parents were Flossie Mae (n\u00e9e Harp; 1902\u20131984) and James Francis Haggard (1899\u20131946).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://merlehaggard.com/bio|title=Haggard bio|publisher=Merlehaggard.com|access-date=June 2, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626141355/http://merlehaggard.com/bio|archive-date=June 26, 2015}}</ref> The family moved to California from their home in [[Checotah, Oklahoma]], during the Great Depression, after their barn burned in 1934.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|p=XVII}}\n\nThey settled with their two elder children, James 'Lowell' (1922\u20131996) and Lillian, in an apartment in [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], while James started working for the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway|Santa Fe Railroad]].

He was released 15 months later but was sent back after beating a local boy during a burglary attempt. After Haggard's release, he and Teague saw Lefty Frizzell in concert. The two sat backstage, where Haggard began to sing along. Hearing the young man from the stage, Frizzell refused to go on unless Haggard was allowed to sing first. Haggard did, and was well received by the audience. After this experience Haggard decided to pursue a career in music.

Soon, he was performing again and later began recording with Tally Records. The [[Bakersfield sound]] was developing in the area as a reaction against the overproduced [[Nashville sound]].{{sfn|Cusic|2002|pp=XXIII\u2013XXVI}} Haggard's first record for Tally was \"Singing My Heart Out\" backed by \"Skid Row\"; it was not a success, and only 200 copies were pressed.

He asked for permission to record it, and the resulting single was a national hit in 1964. The following year, he had his first national top-10 record with \"[[(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers]],\" written by [[Liz Anderson]], mother of country singer [[Lynn Anderson]], and his career was off and running.{{sfn|Cusic|2002|pp=XXVII\u2013XXVIII}} Haggard recalls having been talked into visiting Anderson\u2014a woman he did not know\u2014at her house to hear her sing some songs she had written. \"If there was anything I didn't wanna do, it was sit around some danged woman's house and listen to her cute little songs.

The doctor's prognosis was dire, Warren was given less than a 50-percent chance of survival. He spent the next three years at [[St. Jude Children's Research Hospital]] in Memphis, Tennessee seeking treatment. Warren began treatment at St. Jude on January 5, 1999. Over an almost three-year period, he endured over 120 rounds of [[chemotherapy]]. In 2001, Warren was diagnosed as cancer free.<ref>Watts, Cindy (2012). \"Darren Warren Plays St. Jude.\" The Tennessean. Retrieved May 16, 2012.</ref>\n\n\"There are things that come at you that are stumbling blocks.,\" Warren said. \"If we can take them and make them stepping stones, we can help more people and do things to change people's lives.\"\nIn August 2011, Darren Warren celebrated a milestone: 10 years in remission from non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.  \"Going back to St. Jude with my guitar to meet the patients and sing songs like \"Old McDonald Had a Farm\" might sound small to a lot of people, but to me, that's what it's all about.\"<ref>The Huffington Post (2012). \"How I'm Still Saying Thank You to St. Jude's Hospital Research.\" Retrieved May 16, 2012.</ref>\n\n==Music career==\nAfter overcoming cancer, Warren set his sights on another challenge: conquering the airwaves of country music as a performing songwriter. So far, he has shared the stage with [[Vince Gill]], [[Travis Tritt]], and Emerson Drive, among others. Warren has also journeyed across the country sharing his story and his music. He is an active participant in St. Jude's Country Cares for Kids, a radiothon founded by [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] band member, [[Randy Owen]]. The cross-country tour is focused on raising awareness and support for the research medical center.\n\nDarren Warren's CD \"Cowboy Up and Party Down\" was recorded in Nashville, Tennessee and produced by industry veteran Doug Grau. Grau is credited with producing [[The Statler Brothers]], as well as stand-up acts [[Jeff Foxworthy]] and Bill Engvall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/doug-grau-p81673/credits |title=Doug Grau Songs, Albums, Reviews, Bio & More |website=www.allmusic.com |access-date=May 17, 2012}}</ref> Warren plans to release his next single, \"The Way God Made Me,\" in June 2012.\n\nDarren Warren now regards the diagnosis he received as a teenager a blessing-in-disguise.  Warren's life-threatening experience was a life-changing catalyst that propelled him into the future pursuing his dream as a country music artist. Warren never lacked inspiration during his time in the hospital. Incredibly, it was during treatment that he wrote almost every song that would be recorded on his debut CD.\n\n\"There were times when I sat down and told my guitar how I felt, and I realized I had created a song,\" Warren remembers.\n\nThe title track \"Cowboy Up and Party Down\" (written by Eddie Kilgallon) was released as his first single and distributed to country music radio stations in May 2011. A poignant song Warren wrote for the album, \"Go Get My Angel,\" deals with the loss of a young victim to cancer. Randy Owen of the Country Music Hall of Fame band Alabama is featured as a guest artist on the song. It is a fan favorite that has provided inspiration to many families struggling with grief.<ref>Skates, Sarah (September 22, 2011). \"Darren Warren Working Debut EP\". Music Row. Retrieved May 17, 2012.</ref>\n\nWarren has said that the sole motivation for his music career is simple: he wants to offer hope and encouragement to young boys and girls faced with a terminal illness.<ref>\"Earning His Wings\" Reprinted from Promise magazine, autumn 2007.
