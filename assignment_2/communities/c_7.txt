McKean was Dusty's wife and manager for over 50 years. \n\nMcKean's sister Heather, half of the McKean Sisters music duo that preceded Joy's association with Dusty, was married to Australian country singer [[Reg Lindsay]], before separating and later divorcing in the 1980s, whereupon the McKean sisters re-started their music duo.\n\nTogether Dusty and Joy McKean had two children, [[Anne Kirkpatrick]] and David Kirkpatrick, who are also accomplished singer-songwriters.<ref name=\"slimdusty.com.au\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slimdusty.com.au/news.html#joytributeconcert |title=News |publisher=Slim Dusty |access-date=10 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430142753/http://www.slimdusty.com.au/news.html#joytributeconcert |archive-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Dusty hits written by Joy McKean===\nMcKean wrote several of Dusty's most popular songs, including \"[[Lights On The Hill]]\", \"Walk a Country Mile\", \"Indian Pacific\", \"Kelly's Offsider\", \"The Angel of Goulburn Hill\" and \"[[The Biggest Disappointment]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://store.countrymusic.com.au/store/item.inetstore?id=343 |title=The Country Music Store \u2013 Slim Dusty Sings Joy McKean |publisher=Store.countrymusic.com.au |access-date=10 April 2012 |archive-date=30 August 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830034755/http://store.countrymusic.com.au/store/item.inetstore?id=343 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Other songwriters' contributions===\nAlthough himself an accomplished writer of songs, Dusty had a number of other songwriters, including Mack Cormack, [[Gordon Parsons (singer-songwriter)|Gordon Parsons]], [[Stan Coster]], and Kelly Dixon, who were typically short on formal education but big on personal experience of the [[Australian bush]]. Drawing on his travels and such writers over a span of decades, Dusty chronicled the story of a rapidly changing postwar Australian nation.\n\n===First megahit===\nDusty's 1957 hit \"[[A Pub with No Beer]]\" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, the first Australian single to go gold and the first and only 78 rpm record to be awarded a gold disc.<ref name=\"Guardian-obit\">Dave Laing, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries \"Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer\"], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003</ref> (The \"Pub with No Beer\" is a real place, in [[Taylors Arm, New South Wales|Taylors Arm]], not far from Kempsey, where Slim was born.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mynrma.com.au/cps/rde/xchg/mynrma/hs.xsl/north_coast_pub.htm|title=North Coast: The Pub With No Beer|publisher=[[NRMA]]|access-date=13 June 2008}}</ref> In 1959 and 1960, Dutch and German cover versions of the song became number one hits (even evergreens) in Belgium, Austria and Germany, brought by the Flemish country singer-guitarist and amusement park founder [[Bobbejaan Schoepen]].\nIn 1964 the annual Slim Dusty Australia-round tour, a {{Convert|48280|km|mi|0}} journey that went on for ten months, was started. This regular event was the subject of a feature film, ''[[The Slim Dusty Movie]]'', in 1984.\n\n===Contributions of other songwriters===\nDusty recorded not only songs written by himself and other fellow Australian performers but also classic Australian poems by [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]], with new tunes to call attention to the old \"bush ballads\". An example is \"[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]\" by Paterson. The 1980 album and songs ''The Man Who Steadies the Lead'' and ''The Pearl of Them All'' were the works of Paterson's rival for the title of Australia's bush balladeer, Scottish-Australian poet [[William Henry Ogilvie|Will H.

They have released a total of seven studio albums since 2005. Their debut album, ''Little Bit Rusty'', was released in 2005. Their latest album, ''Here We Go'', was released in September 2016.\n\n==Biography==\nThe Sunny Cowgirls, Sophie and Celeste Clabburn, grew up on a farm in [[Hamilton, Victoria]]. The Clabburn sisters were raised on \"Sunninghill\", the family farm at [[Dunkeld]] near Hamilton, Victoria, before the whole family moved to [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]] when they were primary school kids. Their farm was in their father's family a long while, and that's where they came up with the name \"Sunny\".<ref>[http://www.sunnycowgirls.com.au/ Sunny Cowgirls official site]</ref> After four years of working around the country and doing the occasional gig, they raised enough cash to approach well-known Perth record producer Mark Donohoe to showcase their writing and music.\n\nThe Cowgirls lives and careers changed in early 2005 when they secured places as aspiring artists in the CMAA College of Country Music, held before the [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]] each year. They then signed with Compass Bros Records and their first album, ''Little Bit Rusty'', reached No.&nbsp;4 on the [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] country charts.\n \nThe Sunny Cowgirls have also collaborated with [[Adam Brand (musician)|Adam Brand]] on \"Someday\".{{when|date=November 2020}}\n\nOn 1 September 2012 The Sunny Cowgirls performed at the 25th [[Trundle, New South Wales|Trundle]] Bush Tucker Day.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"6\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"65\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br /><ref>Peaks in Australia:\n* All except noted: {{cite web|url=https://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=The+Sunny+Cowgirls|title=Discography The Sunny Cowgirls|website=australian-charts.com|access-date=20 October 2022}}\n* ''Little Bit Rusty'' and ''Long Five Days'': {{cite Ryan|page=272}}</ref>\n! width=\"65\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS Country]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Little Bit Rusty''\n|\n* Release date: 18 April 2005\n* Label: Compass Bros.\n* Format: [[Compact Disc|CD]], [[music download|download]]\n|80\n|4 \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Long Five Days''\n|\n* Release date: 28 August 2006\n* Label: Compass Bros.\n* Format: CD, download\n|93\n|7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Dust Will Settle''\n|\n* Release date: 2 August 2008\n* Label: Compass Bros.\n* Format: CD, download\n|37\n|2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Summer''\n|\n* Release date: 15 January 2010\n* Label: Compass Bros.\n* Format: CD, download\n|33\n|3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''What We Do''\n|\n* Release date: 11 January 2013\n* Label: WJO Distribution\n* Format: CD, download\n|42\n|2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''My Old Man''\n|\n* Release date: 29 August 2014\n* Label: WJO Distribution\n* Format: CD, download\n|85\n|12\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Here We Go''\n|\n* Release date: 30 September 2016\n* Label: [[ABC Music]], [[Universal Music Australia]]\n* Format: CD, download\n|13\n|3<br /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/charts/country-albums-chart/2016-10-10|title=ARIA Australian Top 40 Country Albums|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|date=10 October 2016|access-date=20 October 2022}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Happy Days''\n|\n* Release date: 20 September 2019\n* Label: [[ABC Music]], [[Universal Music Australia]]\n* Format: CD, download\n|0 unk\n|0 unk\n|}\n\n===Live albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|+ List of live albums, with selected details\n!

As a songwriter, she keeps getting better at writing about the stuff of everyday lives (love, lust, disappointment, getting on with life) with an uncommon degree of horse sense and attention to detail, and if anything, the new musical backdrops have added to the depth of her emotional landscapes.\"<ref name=\"Deming 3\"/> Its lead single, \"[[Nothing at All (Kasey Chambers song)|Nothing at All]]\" (July), reached the top&nbsp;ten.<ref name=\"AUS\"/>\n\n===2008\u20132010: ''Rattlin' Bones'' to ''Little Bird''===\n[[File:Kasey Chambers.jpg|Chambers at the ARIA Hall of Fame, July 2008|thumb|160px|alt=The 32-year-old Chambers wears a white dress with bare shoulders.

In early 1978, Williamson released his first compilation album under the ''Country Greats'' series. This was followed later in the year by his third album, ''Road to Town'', with contributions by other musicians including [[Tommy Emmanuel]] on guitar. Also that year Williamson formed a country music band, Crow, which performed on the pub and club circuit across Australia. In 1980 Crow were renamed as Sydney Radio, to play rock music with a reggae influence. The members used face paint, with Williamson disguised as the clown, Ludwig Leichhardt. Williamson penned rock and reggae numbers for the band some of which were recorded but never released. Since 1970 Williamson has had a friendship with radio presenter, [[John Laws]], who calls Williamson his 'little brother'. In 1977, Williamson recorded and released a single, \"It's a Grab It While It's Goin' Kind of Life\", which is a musical tribute to Laws. Up until Laws' first retirement on 25 June 2007, Williamson wrote and performed a series of [[jingle]]s for Laws' morning show on [[2UE]], and his final jingle was \"Hey good on ya Lawsie, you pulled the plug at last\".

He recorded a tribute song for [[ANZAC]]s, \"Diggers of the ANZAC (This Is Gallipoli)\", which was well received and issued as a single. Williamson met [[Pixie Jenkins]], a fiddle player, and the two toured together for several years. In April 1981 Williamson issued a single, \"The Breaker\", featuring narrated vocals by [[Bud Tingwell|Charles 'Bud' Tingwell]], which was inspired by the movie, ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]'' (1980) (which had Tingwell as a supporting actor).<ref name=\"Breaker\">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvmem.com/OZST/ffilms/B-FFILM/BREAKERM.htm | title = ''Breaker Morant'' | publisher = Australian Soundtracks | editor = Dennis W.

It featured another comic track, \"I'm Fair Dinkum\". Williamson then launched his merchandise business, The Fair Dinkum Road Company, in Sydney. The album included his cover version of [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]]'s 1971 single, \"[[I'll Be Gone (Spectrum song)|I'll Be Gone]]\", which he played using only guitar and harmonica.

The opening track \"Sing You the Outback\" revealed how important the Australian [[outback]] has been in the past and how invaluable it will be into the future. The next two tracks, \"Frangipani Bay\" and \"Cape York Peninsula\", were written during a road trip to Australia's most northern point. The lyrics in \"The Devil's Boots\" relate to the bushranger, [[Ned Kelly]]. \"Buried in Her Bedclothes\" was written after Williamson and Mary-Kay, his spouse of the time, met an elderly woman on an [[Indian Pacific]] rail trip. Her husband had died six months earlier and she had refused to get out of bed for three months. Her family suggested the train trip as a remedy \u2013 she shared her memories with the Williamsons and said that the train 'had done the job'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://members.madasafish.com/~d_hodgkinson/TBsongs.htm|title=John Williamson - the Aussie Ballader |publisher=Mad as a Fish|access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nWilliamson referred to 2003 as his 'most True Blue year ever'. He was elected President of the CMAA after Dusty retired. He then released the sequel to the [[True Blue \u2013 The Very Best of John Williamson|1995 compilation]] ''[[True Blue Two]]'', which reached No.&nbsp;8.<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/> It featured his hit songs up to the ''[[Gunyah (album)|Gunyah]]'' album and exclusively including five new tracks. On 12 October, Williamson was asked by the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]], to perform \"Waltzing Matilda\" at the Memorial Service for the first Anniversary of the [[2002 Bali bombings]].\n\nAt the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2004 Williamson and [[Sara Storer]] won 'Vocal Collaboration of the Year' and 'Single of the Year' for \"Raining on the Plains\", and the track won 'Song of the Year' which was shared with Storer and her co-writers, [[Garth Porter]] and Doug Storer.<ref name=\"CMAA2004\">{{cite web | url = http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/61-2004 | title = 2004 | date = 2 July 2010 | publisher = Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110219151242/http://country.com.au/winners-archive/61-2004 | archive-date = 19 February 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The track is on Storer's 2002 album, ''[[Beautiful Circle]]''. With regard to new arrangements of John's songs, having recorded a cover version of [[Stan Coster]]'s \"Wobbly Boot Hotel\" on ''[[Waratah St]]'' in 1991, he re-recorded it in 2004 as a duet with Coster's daughter [[Tracy Coster|Tracy]] on \"Coster Country\", her tribute album to him. 2005 was a productive year for John in terms of recording and touring; he re-recorded \"Wrinkles\" as a duet with John Stephan, issued a twenty-track compilation of Queensland-themed songs, called \"From Bulldust to Bitumen\", available only to RACQ members, and in August, ''[[Chandelier of Stars]]'' was released, which reached No.&nbsp;11 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/> At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2006 he won 'Album of the Year' and 'Top Selling Album' for ''Chandelier of Stars'', and the track \"Bells in a Bushman's Ear\" won 'Bush Ballad of the Year'.<ref name=\"CMAA2006\">{{cite web | url = http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/63-2006 | title = 2006 | date = 2 July 2010 | publisher = Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140109030257/http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/63-2006 | archive-date = 9 January 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nIn discussing John's wife of the time, the opening track, \"Little Girl from the Dryland\", describes Mary-Kay and her childhood in Tulloona Bore, south of [[Boggabilla]], from her point of view. \"Chandelier of Stars\" is a description of the night sky before sunrise. \"Bells in a Bushman's Ear\" is a tribute to Australia's country music forefathers, and \"The Camel Boy\" is about the life of indigenous artist, [[Albert Namatjira]], who is [[Warren H Williams]]' great uncle. \"Keeper of the Stones\", which first appeared on Williamson's live album and DVD of 2004, ''[[Mates on the Road]]'', was dedicated to indigenous Australians of [[The Stolen Generation]]. \"Desert Child\", another duet with Williams is a bush lullaby for Aboriginal children. Also on ''[[Chandelier of Stars]]'' is \"A Country Balladeer\" which is a duet with [[Chad Morgan]], and \"Flower on the Water\" is a tribute to the victims of the Bali bombings. The first four lines are inspired by words on a photo of a deceased victim: \"To hear your voice, to see you smile / To sit and talk to you awhile / To be together the same old way / That would be our greatest wish today\". Williamson found the author and started a friendship.\n\nThe following November, Williamson released the new song \"We Love This Country\" on a compilation of the same name with his favourite holiday songs to promote Australian tourism with [[travel trailer|caravans]] \u2013 it became a jingle for [[Jayco]] commercials. He promoted the aforementioned projects of 2005 together with [[Pixie Jenkins]] and [[Warren H Williams]] as part of their True Blue Reunion Tour. In August 2006, ''[[The Platinum Collection (John Williamson album)|The Platinum Collection]]'', a three-disc set of Williamson's hits from 1970''\u2013''2005 was released. In September, Williamson was devastated after hearing of the death of fellow wildlife conservationist and friend, [[Steve Irwin]]. In reaction to the news, he wrote a tribute tune, \"Wildlife Warriors: It's Time\". He was evidently emotional while performing both \"[[Give Me a Home Among the Gumtrees|Home Among the Gum Trees]]\" and \"True Blue\" at Irwin's memorial service inside the arena of his [[Australia Zoo]] Crocoseum. The service was filmed live-to-air and later released on DVD. ''[[Wildlife Warriors (album)|Wildlife Warriors]]'' was additionally released in November 2006 on a compilation album of the same name, along with twelve of Williamson's favourite conservation awareness tracks and his two live performances from Irwin's memorial.\n\nAt the beginning of 2008 Williamson decided to put together a musical. Based on his music and lyrics, the book by [[Simon Heath]] and directed by [[Bernie Zelvis]], Williamson named it ''[[Quambatook (musical)|Quambatook \u2013 The Musical]]''. On 7 February 2008, the musical was premiered at the EVAN Theater in [[Penrith, New South Wales|Penrith]] to positive reviews, making it a major highlight in the history of Australian musical theatre.\n\nThe album ''[[Hillbilly Road]]'' was released in August 2008. The lyrics for the album were inspired by his home in [[Springbrook, Queensland|Springbrook]]. Subsequent singles that followed were \"Cydi\", \"Drink a Little Love\", \"Australia Is Another Word for Free\" as a trio with Williams and [[Amos Morris]], and \"Better Than a Picture\". \"The Joy Is in the Journey\" was a special bonus addition to finish the album, previously appearing on the [[Quambatook (musical)#Concept album|Quambatook Musical soundtrack]]. The ''[[Hillbilly Road]]'' album was promoted everywhere around Australia until early the next year when Williams decided to move on and pursue other musical projects, leaving Williamson to perform the rest of the tour solo. At the Country Music Awards of Australia for 2009 he won 'Bush Ballad of the Year' for \"Australia Is Another Word for Free\", performed by Williamson, Williams and Morris.<ref name=\"CMAA2009\">{{cite web | url = http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/66-2009 | title = 2009 | date = 2 July 2010 | publisher = Country Music Association of Australia (CMAA) | access-date = 25 October 2012 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110706103257/http://www.country.com.au/winners-archive/66-2009 | archive-date = 6 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy late 2009 Williamson got together with fellow country star [[Adam Harvey]] and recorded their cover to Roger Miller's \"[[King of the Road (song)|King of the Road]]\", issued both as a single and on Harvey's duets album ''Both Sides Now''. Williamson then made his [[Carols By Candlelight]] debut at the [[Sidney Myer Music Bowl]].\n\n===2010s===\nOn 26 January ([[Australia Day]]) 2010 Williamson released a new Australian anthem called \"Island of Oceans\" as a duet with [[Shannon Noll]]. Williamson released a new double-CD compilation album ''[[Absolute Greatest: 40 Years True Blue]]'' commemorating this milestone. At a press conference for the album in Tamworth on 21 January hosted by the then [[Governor-General]] [[Quentin Bryce]], in his acceptance speech, John expressed his gratitude for the longevity of his career up to that point, in the process thanking his fans, friends and family, including his first wife, Mary-Kay.\n\nOn 28 January 2011 Williamson released a recording of a concert with the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] at the [[Sydney Opera House]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicshop.com.au/john-williamson-john-williamson-in-symphony-cd-dvd.html |title=John Williamson John Williamson in Symphony CD/DVD |access-date=2 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903155834/http://www.musicshop.com.au/john-williamson-john-williamson-in-symphony-cd-dvd.html |archive-date=3 September 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sanity.com.au/products/2195165/John_Williamson_In_Symphony_SIGNED_COPY | title=John Williamson in Symphony }}</ref> At the Australian Country Music Awards in Tamworth that same month John presented [[Jimmy Little]] with the Lifetime Achievement\nAward.\n\nIn January 2012, Williamson released ''[[The Big Red]]''.

In 2013, a new two-disc set of John's hits, ''[[Hell of a Career]]'' was released. In 2014, Williamson released his fiftieth album (including compilations) called ''[[Honest People]]'', as well as writing his [[autobiography]], issued by [[Penguin Books|Penguin]]. Both were released on 25 July 2014. As well as this, he made his debut as an exhibitionist painter. In 2014, it was announced by John via ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]'' that he has been diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]].\n\nIn April 2016, he released an EP called ''Looking for a Story'', a new ANZAC tribute and six other sets of previously issued lyrics. John released his twentieth studio album ''[[Butcherbird (album)|Butcherbird]]'' in August 2018.\n\n===2020s===\nIn 2020, Williamson celebrated 50 years since the release of \"Old Man Emu\", by releasing a 25xCD single box set, featuring 50 tracks spanning his career. Williamson said \"Putting together this collection gave me a chance to take stock of what I've achieved during my career... While I'm not looking to retire just yet, once I've completed my 2020 Winding Back Tour I'll be scaling down my live appearances.

Storer has been a member of a country music trio, [[Songbirds (group)|Songbirds]] (2007\u201309) alongside [[Beccy Cole]] and [[Gina Jeffries]]. Her older brother, [[Greg Storer]], is also a country music singer-songwriter and the siblings have recorded and performed together.\n\n==Early career==\nSara Bettine Storer was born in October 1973 in [[Wemen, Victoria|Wemen]] where her parents, Lindsay and Fay<!-- maiden name not seen in sources --> Storer, farmed wheat and cattle on a {{convert|5000|acre|ha}} property.<ref name=\"APRA Buffalo\"/><ref name=\"Dawson\"/> Her three brothers, including Doug and [[Greg Storer]], became farmers, she also has two older sisters.<ref name=\"Dawson\"/><ref name=\"Fidler inter\"/> She attended school in nearby, [[Robinvale]].<ref name=\"Thorburn\"/>\n\nStorer later recalled, \"I wasn't much of a farmer's daughter. Three brothers \u2013 they did everything and they enjoyed it. I would rather sit at home and help out with mum really. I was scared of cattle. I always got yelled at cos I was in the wrong spot you know, didn't really know what I was doing. I was never very good.\"<ref name=\"Fidler inter\"/> She completed her tertiary studies in Melbourne, becoming a teacher and then headed north in the mid-1990s. Living in [[Camooweal, Queensland|Camooweal]], she met a retired [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] shooter, Harry Chandler, whose stories inspired her to write, \"Buffalo Bill\", her first song.<ref name=\"APRA Buffalo\"/><ref name=\"Dawson\"/>\n\nNine months later, Storer moved to [[Katherine, Northern Territory]], where she taught kindergarten level at Casuarina Street Primary School.<ref name=\"ABC Bio\"/> After a year there she taught at [[Kalkarindji]] ({{convert|466|km|mi}} southwest of Katherine), for four years.<ref name=\"ABC Bio\"/><ref name=\"AMO Bio\"/> Later she co-wrote and recorded a track, \"Children of the Gurindji\", with [[Kev Carmody]], for her compilation album, ''[[Calling Me Home \u2013 The Best of Sara Storer]]'' (April 2010).\n\nCarmody told [[Rhoda Roberts]] of ''Deadly Vibe'', \"[Storer] came up here about 12 months ago and we did a song about the Gurindji kids together. The whole basis of the song was, when she went to teach at Kalkarindji \u2013 she taught there for a number of years \u2013 she said that she came away with the kids teaching her more than she taught them, and that was the chorus of the song.\"<ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\nWhen not teaching she started playing at parties across the territory. She won a talent quest at [[Adelaide River, Northern Territory|Adelaide River]] which provided a scholarship to the College of Country Music, held two weeks before the [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]], in January 2000. There she met [[Garth Porter]], former keyboard player with [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]], and a record producer of fellow singers, [[Lee Kernaghan]] and [[Gina Jeffreys]]. Porter worked with Storer to record six tracks which he showcased to [[ABC Music]]'s owners, who agreed to sign her to their label.\n\n==Recording career==\n===2000\u20132009===\nSara Storer released her debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Buffalo]]'', in August 2000 via ABC Music/[[Universal Music Australia]] with Porter producing. It peaked in the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] top&nbsp;100, No.&nbsp;20 on the Australasian Artists, No.&nbsp;8 on the Hitseekers and No.&nbsp;6 on the Country albums charts.<ref name=\"ARIA Report 626\"/> She won the Best New Talent category at the 2001 [[Country Music Awards of Australia]] for her debut single, \"Buffalo Bill\", in January of that year.<ref name=\"CMAoA 2000s\"/>\n\nHer second album, ''[[Beautiful Circle]]'', was released in November 2002, which was produced by Porter again. In January 2004 at the Country Music Awards of Australia she was nominated for eight Golden Guitars, and won seven of them \u2013 a then-record number of trophies at one ceremony:<ref name=\"ARIA Report 804\"/><ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> Vocal Collaboration, Single of the Year and Song of the Year all for \"Raining on the Plains\" (with [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]]); Female Vocalist of the Year and Album of the Year for ''Beautiful Circle'', Songwriter of the Year for \"Raining on the Plains\" (co-written with Porter and Greg Storer); Bush Ballad of the Year for \"Boss Drovers Pride\" and Heritage Song of the Year for \"Drover's Call\".<ref name=\"CMAoA 2000s\"/>\n\nThe album reached No.&nbsp;50 on the ARIA Albums Chart in March 2004.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> It also peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on the Australasian Artists, No.&nbsp;1 on the Hitseekers and No.&nbsp;2 on the Country albums charts.<ref name=\"ARIA Report 732\"/> She promoted it by touring with Australian country singer, [[Troy Cassar-Daley]],<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> and United Kingdom singer, [[Charlie Landsborough]], including playing to an audience of over 40,000 people at the [[Gympie Muster]], Queensland. On 6 October 2004 she issued her first DVD, ''Stories to Tell'', which included music videos, interview footage, acoustic performances and new tracks.<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/>\n\n''[[Firefly (Sara Storer album)|Firefly]]'', was Storer's third album, was released in July 2005, which peaked at No.&nbsp;24 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name=\"ARIA Report 804\"/><ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> Porter produced the work and it became her first number-one on the ARIA Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"ARIA Report 804\"/> She co-wrote and recorded duets on three tracks: with Greg (\"Chiller's Bend\"), [[Josh Cunningham]] (\"Important Things\") and [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]] (\"Must've Been a Hell of a Party\").\n\nKelly described Storer, \"You know she's paid attention, heard the bush waking up in the morning, listened to the worries thrashed out at the kitchen table, smelt dry summer wheat up close, dreamed of far away places in a bedroom with a window on a big sky, driven miles on dirt and bitumen and fallen in and out of love. She's found her own way to sing the stories that are all around her and then inside her bubbling out. She doesn't copy over-emotive, fake sincere twangy country singers from overseas. She's found her own restraint and steel and lets her songs do their sweet, sly work.\"<ref name=\"ABC Bio\"/>\n\nIn December 2005 [[Deborah Conway]] established the Broad Festival project, \"the idea that I would pull these different women performers together from different genres and call it Broad\".<ref name=\"Elliott\"/> Storer joined Conway, [[Katie Noonan]], [[Ruby Hunter]] and [[Clare Bowditch]] where they performed their own and each other's songs on an Australian tour.<ref name=\"Elliott\"/><ref name=\"Broad2005\"/> Conway observed, \"Sara you're a gorgeous surprise package, quiet and unassuming offstage; onstage, you had us pissing ourselves every night. I love that simple yet deceptive guitar playing and those haunting songs, which have such a piercing truth to them.\"<ref name=\"Broad2005\"/>\n\nIn March 2006 Storer played at the Queens' Lunch during the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|Melbourne Commonwealth Games]]. In February and March 2007 she performed a double-headlining tour with fellow country musician, [[Felicity Urquhart]].<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> In November of that year she released her fourth studio album, ''[[Silver Skies]]'', which reached the ARIA Albums Chart top&nbsp;100 and No.&nbsp;3 on the Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> It was co-produced by Cunningham and Matt Fell for her new label, [[EMI Records]].<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/><ref name=\"Dawson 3\"/>\n\nIts lead single, \"Land Cries Out\", was released in September 2007, which Andrew Tijs of ''Undercover News'' described, \"an achingly beautiful rumination on the bitterness of being forced to leave the land you love \u2013 an all too common scenario during the recent drought. With this heartfelt subject matter, Storer has branched away from traditional country sounds... [she] uses electric guitar and drums to complement the lament.\"<ref name=\"Tijs 2\"/> From late January to early February 2008 she supported a tour by American singer-songwriter, [[Suzanne Vega]].<ref name=\"Tijs\"/>\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009 she joined [[Beccy Cole]] and [[Gina Jeffreys]] to form a country music trio, [[Songbirds (group)|Songbirds]].<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> The group released a live DVD, ''You've Got a Friend: Live in Concert'', on 1 May 2009, which was accredited by [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] as a gold album by the end of that year.<ref name=\"ARIA Acred 09\"/> It was recorded at Tamworth in January 2009.<ref name=\"Dawson 2\"/> It was shown at cinemas from 29 April of that year, Storer opined, \"I'm really proud of the Songbirds: You've Got a Friend live filming but am worried how pregnant I will look shown on a big screen.\"<ref name=\"Cashmere 1\"/>\n\nStorer had encouraged her brother Greg, a cropping farmer from \"Strawin\" {{convert|60|km|mi}} north-west of [[Warren, New South Wales]], to write music, she has performed his work, including duets with him and she is recorded on his debut single, \"When I Was a Boy\" (December 2009).<ref name=\"Land Warren\"/> He recalled, \"Sara started off telling me to write some lyrics and then every now and then she said I should get up and have a sing at one of her shows. It was absolutely terrifying to get up and sing in front of some great artists... [its] a bit addictive. The trick is to never put the guitar away \u2013 in between wrestling with the kids or doing something else, I can just pick up the guitar.\"<ref name=\"Land Warren\"/>\n\n===2010\u20132020===\nIn April 2010, Storer released her first compilation album, ''Calling Me Home \u2013 The Best of Sara Storer'', which reached No.&nbsp;28 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No.&nbsp;1 on the Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> She had recorded three new tracks, \"Calling Me Home\", \"Children of the Gurundi\" (with Kev Carmody) and \"Tears\".

We need a little practice run otherwise we could end up a train smash.\"<ref name=\"Hamley\"/> ''Lovegrass'', which was produced by Matt Fell, peaked at No.&nbsp;25 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No.&nbsp;5 on the Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> In 2015 Storer recorded \"Song for Grace\", a duet with Lee Kernaghan for his album, ''[[Spirit of the Anzacs (album)|Spirit of the Anzacs]]'' (March 2015).\n\nIn March 2016 Storer released her sixth studio album, ''[[Silos (album)|Silos]]'', also produced by Fell, which peaked at No.&nbsp;30 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No.&nbsp;3 on the Country Music Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> It earned the musician her sixth nomination for [[ARIA Award for Best Country Album]] and her first win in the category, at [[ARIA Music Awards of 2016|that year's]] ceremony.<ref name=\"ARIA List\"/> At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 2017 she received her 21st Golden Guitar \u2013 the most by any female artist.<ref name=\"CMAoA 2010s\"/><ref name=\"Young\"/>\n\nIn April 2019, Storer released her 7th studio album, ''[[Raindance (Sara Storer album)|Raindance]]''.\n\n===2020\u2013present===\nIn January 2023, Sara will feature on the self-titled album by Storer, alongside her brother Greg and Greg's daughters Bonnie & Pip.<ref name=\"storer by storer\"/>\n\n== Personal life==\nWhen Sara Storer was 18, her parents moved from Wemen, Victoria to a farming property near Warren, New South Wales.<ref name=\"Dawson 2\"/><ref name=\"OSullivan\"/> Storer had lived in Melbourne, moved to Camooweal, North Queensland and then to Katherine and Kalkarindji, Northern Territory in the mid-1990s.

Shea had two #1 songs off this first album with songs \"Just the excuse\" and \"Everyday Girl\". In early 2009, [[James Stroud]] heard music from Fisher's second album \"Shea\" and signed her to, [[Stroudavarious Records]] where [[Richard Landis]] and [[Steve Forde]] produce her music.<ref>[http://www.musicrow.com/2009/05/shea-fisher-signs-with-stroudavarious/ Shea Fisher Signs With Stroudavarious] MusicRow.com</ref>\n.

Originally a session player in many bands, he has released many award-winning recordings as a solo artist. In June 2010, Emmanuel was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM);<ref name=\"It's an Honour: AM\">{{cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1142663 |title=It's an Honour \u2013 Honours \u2013 Search Australian Honours |publisher=Itsanhonour.gov.au |date=14 June 2010 |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> in 2011, he was inducted into the [[Australian Roll of Renown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcmf.com.au/What-s-On/Roll-of-Renown/ |title=Roll of Renown|publisher=TCMF |access-date=21 August 2018}}</ref> In 2019, he was listed by MusicRadar as the best [[acoustic guitar]]ist in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|date=12 December 2019|first=Matt |last=Parker |title=The 10 best acoustic guitarists in the world today|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/the-10-best-acoustic-guitarists-in-the-world-today|access-date=2021-08-03|website=MusicRadar|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nOne of six children, Emmanuel was born in [[Muswellbrook, New South Wales]], Australia, in 1955. He received his first guitar in 1959 at age four and was taught by his mother to accompany her playing [[lap steel guitar]]. In 1961, at the age of six, he heard [[Chet Atkins]] playing on the radio. He vividly remembers that moment and said it greatly inspired him as a musician.<ref name=\"pritcher\">{{cite web |url=http://users.adam.com.au/donald/markinter.htm |title=The Official Tommy Emmanuel Web Site \u2013 Interview |publisher=Users.adam.com.au |date=19 April 1997 |access-date=17 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010192609/http://users.adam.com.au/donald/markinter.htm |archive-date=10 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBy the age of six, he was a working professional musician. Recognizing the musical talents of Emmanuel and his older brother, [[Phil Emmanuel|Phil]], their father created a family band, sold their home, and took his family on the road. With the family living in two station wagons, much of Emmanuel's childhood was spent touring Australia, playing rhythm guitar, and rarely going to school. After their father died in 1966, Australian Country Music star [[Buddy Williams (country musician)|Buddy Williams]] approached the family and asked permission to take the Emmanuel brothers on the road with his touring show travelling around Australia. Tommy Emmanuel would go on to record a number of Buddy Williams albums in the early 1970s. The family settled in Parkes after the [[New South Wales Department of Education]] insisted that the Emmanuel children had to go to school regularly. <ref name=\"cmonline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymusiconline.net/tommyemmanuel.html |title=Tommy Emmanuel: c.g.p |publisher=Countrymusiconline.net|access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn his teen years, Tommy Emmanuel moved to Sydney, and was noticed nationally when he won a string of talent contests. <ref name=\"pritcher\" /><ref name=\"musicfrisk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfrisk.com/picture/interview/tommy.emmanuel.fingerstyle.02.14.2003.php |title=Tommy Emmanuel Interview |publisher=Music Frisk |date=14 February 2003 |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> By the late 1970s, he was playing drums with his brother Phil in the group Goldrush as well as doing session work on numerous albums and jingles. He gained further prominence in the late 1970s as the lead guitarist in the Southern Star Band, the backing group for vocalist [[Doug Parkinson]]. During 1986\u20131988 and 1995, he joined the lineup of the leading New Zealand/Australian 1970s rock group [[Dragon (band)|Dragon]] that had reformed in 1982, touring widely with them, including a 1987 tour with [[Tina Turner]]; he left the group to embark on a solo career.\n\nIn 1994, Australian music veteran [[John Farnham]] invited him to play the guitar next to Stuart Fraser from [[Noiseworks]] for the ''Concert for Rwanda''. Emmanuel had previously been a member of Farnham's band during the early 1980s and featured on the album ''[[Uncovered (John Farnham album)|Uncovered]]'' and rejoined after the 1994 concert.\n\nIn July 1999, [[Chet Atkins]] commented that Emmanuel was a \"fearless\" [[fingerpicking]] guitar player and awarded Tommy and four others ([[John Knowles (guitarist)|John Knowles]], [[Marcel Dadi]], [[Jerry Reed]], and [[Steve Wariner]]) the \"Certified Guitar Player\" title.<ref name=Certified>{{cite news|last1=St. James|first1=Adam|title=Tommy Emmanuel: Certified Guitar Player|url=https://www.guitar.com/articles/tommy-emmanuel-certified-guitar-player|access-date=3 June 2019|publisher=Guitar.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111083823/https://guitar.com/articles/tommy-emmanuel-certified-guitar-player|archive-date=11 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Certified Wariner\">{{cite magazine|last1=Thompson|first1=Art|title=Steve Wariner|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/artists/1013/steve-wariner/11636|magazine=[[Guitar Player]]|access-date=25 October 2015|date=1 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nEmmanuel and his brother Phil performed live in Sydney at the closing ceremony of the [[Summer Olympics]] in 2000.

Although Emmanuel's playing incorporates a multitude of musical influences and styles, including [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]] and rock, this type of [[country music|country]] finger-style playing is at the core of his technique. While Emmanuel has never had formal music training and does not read or write music, his natural musical ability, intrinsic sense of rhythm, and charisma gained him fans from all over the world. As a solo performer, he never plays to a setlist and uses a minimum of effects onstage.<ref name=\"musicfrisk\" /> He usually completes studio recordings in one take.\n\n[[File:2024-09-18 Concert of Tommy Emmanuel and Mike Dawes at UdK Berlin Konzertsaal (Martin Rulsch) 163.jpg|thumb|Emmanuel uses a snare-drum brush to emulate the sound of a percussion kit]]\nIn his solo shows, he mainly plays guitars made by [[Maton]], an Australian guitar manufacturer. He usually travels with two custom Maton EBG808 TE models and one TE1 model, both of which are Tommy Emmanuel artist signature models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maton.com.au/product/te-series|title=The Maton TE Series - Maton Guitars Australia|access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref> He has played Maton guitars for most of his career and is somewhat of an ambassador for the company due to his long-standing association with the brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maton.com.au/artists/tommy-emmanuel|title=Tommy Emmanuel - Maton Guitars Australia|access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref> Emmanuel is known for the battered and worn-down appearances of his guitars; a result of his dynamic, energetic playing and percussive techniques. One of his signature performances, for example, involves striking the whole body of the guitar in various places with his hands or a drummer's [[Drum brush#Brushes|snare-drum brush]] to emulate the sound of a percussion kit.\n\nEmmanuel usually keeps one Maton EBG808 in standard guitar tuning (E-A-D-G-B-E), while he tunes his second Maton EBG808 to D-G-D-G-B-E (G6 tuning) and his TE1 to C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}. He generally uses 0.12 gauge (light) strings on one EBG808 and 0.13 gauge (medium) strings on the second Maton EBG808 and on the TE1. This allows him to quickly change tuning by swapping between guitars during a show if needed, rather than spending time onstage re-tuning one guitar.{{Cn|date=December 2023}}\n\nEmmanuel often curls his left thumb around the neck of the guitar onto the [[fretboard]] to play some notes, rather than using only his fingers to play \u2014 contrary to how classical guitarists play, but not unusual for jazz and country guitarists. He frequently plays common three-finger chord shapes with just two fingers. He commonly uses a [[thumbpick]], a flat pick ([[plectrum]]), his fingers, or a combination of these in his playing, a style known as [[hybrid picking]]. Amongst his trademark rapid virtuoso licks and cascading harmonic progressions, he often uses a technique that imitated an electric guitar's tremolo system on acoustic guitar \u2014 by pressing the palm of his right hand against the [[Sound board (music)|sound board]] of the guitar near the neck joint, while maintaining forward pressure with his left hand on the top of the [[headstock]]. The guitar neck slightly bends away from the body and consequently affects the pitch of the strings to achieve the desired sound.{{Cn|date=December 2023}}\n\n==Influences==\nAs a young man in Australia, Emmanuel wrote to his hero [[Chet Atkins]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Eventually, Atkins replied with words of encouragement and a long-standing invitation to drop by to visit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://justjazzguitar.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=329&Itemid=52 |title=Just Jazz Guitar Online \u2013 Tommy Emmanuel Interview |publisher=Justjazzguitar.com |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Emmanuel and Atkins recorded as a duo, releasing the album ''[[The Day Finger Pickers Took Over the World]]''. It would be Atkins's last album, with the exception of \"Solo Sessions\" which Atkins' estate released posthumously.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chet Atkins: Solo Sessions|url=https://www.misterguitar.us/news/solorelease.html|access-date=2021-04-25|website=www.misterguitar.us}}</ref> Emmanuel and Atkins appeared together on [[The Nashville Network]]'s 'Country Christmas' in late 1997, and on that occasion, Atkins stated about him: \"He is one of the greatest guitar players I've ever seen.\" Atkins gave Emmanuel the guitar on which [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith]] recorded \"Guitar Boogie\", one of the foundation performances of the blues guitar world and a regular feature of Emmanuel's shows.\n\nIn July 1999, at the 15th Annual Chet Atkins Appreciation Society Convention,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.misterguitar.com/caas/index.html |title=The Chet Atkins Appreciation Society |publisher=Misterguitar.com |date=21 December 1997 |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> Atkins presented Emmanuel with a Certified Guitar Player award, an honour Chet personally bestowed to only four guitarists.<ref name=\"pritcher\" /> This award gains its fame from being bestowed by Atkins himself, a widely recognised leader in guitar music.

After releasing her first single, \"[[Slipping Away (Max Merritt & The Meteors song)|Slipping Away]]\" (a cover of the 1975 song by [[Max Merritt]]), through [[BMG Music]] and \"Radio Santa\" in 1992, she signed a record deal with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Music]] and released \"Two Stars Fell\" in 1993.

Later that year, she supported [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]] on their Australian tours and positive reviews had her the subject of a ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|Sixty Minutes]]'' story and an ''[[A Current Affair (Australian TV series)|A Current Affair]]', segment. Her debut album, ''[[The Flame (Gina Jeffreys album)|The Flame]]'', was released in August 1994 and went platinum in 1997. Further hits followed, including \"Girls' Night Out\" which won Jeffreys her second Golden Guitar award for Best Female Vocal in 1995.\n\nIn July 1996, Jeffreys released her second album, ''[[Up Close (Gina Jeffreys album)|Up Close]]''. This was to be the album that broke the crossover barrier between country and mainstream. The album debuted straight into the national [[ARIA Charts]] at No. 9 while taking the No. 1 position of the national country charts. ''Up Close'' achieved Gold status during the same year as its release. Jeffreys toured nationally throughout 1996, appeared as a guest host of ''[[Sale of the Century]]'' and co-hosted the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1997|1997]] [[ARIA Music Awards]]. In 1997, she was inducted into the Tamworth Hands of Fame.\n\nIn June 1998, Jeffreys released her third album ''[[Somebody's Daughter (album)|Somebody's Daughter]]'', which peaked at No. 13 on the ARIA Charts.

Jeffreys released a Christmas album in 1999, titled ''[[Christmas Wish (Gina Jeffreys album)|Christmas Wish]]''.\n\nIn December 1999, Jeffrey's performed at the [[Tour of Duty \u2013 Concert for the Troops]] in [[Dili]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.noise11.com/news/historic-1999-tour-of-duty-concert-featuring-john-farnham-kylie-minogue-and-the-living-end-to-be-released-for-anzac-day-20240420|title=Historic 1999 Tour of Duty Concert Featuring John Farnham, Kylie Minogue and The Living End To Be Released For ANZAC Day |website=Noise11|date=20 April 2024|access-date=22 April 2024}}</ref>\n\nThroughout 2000, Jeffreys relocated to Nashville to record her next album, ''[[Angel (Gina Jeffreys album)|Angel]]'', which was released in April 2001. The title track, \"[[Angel (Gina Jeffreys song)|Angel]]\", won numerous awards; including the 2002 Golden Guitar Award for Video Clip of the Year, the 2002 APRA Award for Most Performed Country Work and was named a finalist in the Australian Animation Awards in 2001.
