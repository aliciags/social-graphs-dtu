In 1954, the two launched a full-time business career, including the Slim Dusty Travelling Show. McKean was Dusty's wife and manager for over 50 years. \n\nMcKean's sister Heather, half of the McKean Sisters music duo that preceded Joy's association with Dusty, was married to Australian country singer [[Reg Lindsay]], before separating and later divorcing in the 1980s, whereupon the McKean sisters re-started their music duo.\n\nTogether Dusty and Joy McKean had two children, [[Anne Kirkpatrick]] and David Kirkpatrick, who are also accomplished singer-songwriters.<ref name=\"slimdusty.com.au\">{{cite web |url=http://www.slimdusty.com.au/news.html#joytributeconcert |title=News |publisher=Slim Dusty |access-date=10 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430142753/http://www.slimdusty.com.au/news.html#joytributeconcert |archive-date=30 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Dusty hits written by Joy McKean===\nMcKean wrote several of Dusty's most popular songs, including \"[[Lights On The Hill]]\", \"Walk a Country Mile\", \"Indian Pacific\", \"Kelly's Offsider\", \"The Angel of Goulburn Hill\" and \"[[The Biggest Disappointment]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://store.countrymusic.com.au/store/item.inetstore?id=343 |title=The Country Music Store \u2013 Slim Dusty Sings Joy McKean |publisher=Store.countrymusic.com.au |access-date=10 April 2012 |archive-date=30 August 2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830034755/http://store.countrymusic.com.au/store/item.inetstore?id=343 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Other songwriters' contributions===\nAlthough himself an accomplished writer of songs, Dusty had a number of other songwriters, including Mack Cormack, [[Gordon Parsons (singer-songwriter)|Gordon Parsons]], [[Stan Coster]], and Kelly Dixon, who were typically short on formal education but big on personal experience of the [[Australian bush]]. Drawing on his travels and such writers over a span of decades, Dusty chronicled the story of a rapidly changing postwar Australian nation.\n\n===First megahit===\nDusty's 1957 hit \"[[A Pub with No Beer]]\" was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, the first Australian single to go gold and the first and only 78 rpm record to be awarded a gold disc.<ref name=\"Guardian-obit\">Dave Laing, [https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries \"Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer\"], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003</ref> (The \"Pub with No Beer\" is a real place, in [[Taylors Arm, New South Wales|Taylors Arm]], not far from Kempsey, where Slim was born.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mynrma.com.au/cps/rde/xchg/mynrma/hs.xsl/north_coast_pub.htm|title=North Coast: The Pub With No Beer|publisher=[[NRMA]]|access-date=13 June 2008}}</ref> In 1959 and 1960, Dutch and German cover versions of the song became number one hits (even evergreens) in Belgium, Austria and Germany, brought by the Flemish country singer-guitarist and amusement park founder [[Bobbejaan Schoepen]].\nIn 1964 the annual Slim Dusty Australia-round tour, a {{Convert|48280|km|mi|0}} journey that went on for ten months, was started. This regular event was the subject of a feature film, ''[[The Slim Dusty Movie]]'', in 1984.\n\n===Contributions of other songwriters===\nDusty recorded not only songs written by himself and other fellow Australian performers but also classic Australian poems by [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]], with new tunes to call attention to the old \"bush ballads\". An example is \"[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]\" by Paterson. The 1980 album and songs ''The Man Who Steadies the Lead'' and ''The Pearl of Them All'' were the works of Paterson's rival for the title of Australia's bush balladeer, Scottish-Australian poet [[William Henry Ogilvie|Will H.

They have released a total of seven studio albums since 2005. Their debut album, ''Little Bit Rusty'', was released in 2005. Their latest album, ''Here We Go'', was released in September 2016.\n\n==Biography==\nThe Sunny Cowgirls, Sophie and Celeste Clabburn, grew up on a farm in [[Hamilton, Victoria]]. The Clabburn sisters were raised on \"Sunninghill\", the family farm at [[Dunkeld]] near Hamilton, Victoria, before the whole family moved to [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]] when they were primary school kids. Their farm was in their father's family a long while, and that's where they came up with the name \"Sunny\".<ref>[http://www.sunnycowgirls.com.au/ Sunny Cowgirls official site]</ref> After four years of working around the country and doing the occasional gig, they raised enough cash to approach well-known Perth record producer Mark Donohoe to showcase their writing and music.\n\nThe Cowgirls lives and careers changed in early 2005 when they secured places as aspiring artists in the CMAA College of Country Music, held before the [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]] each year. They then signed with Compass Bros Records and their first album, ''Little Bit Rusty'', reached No.&nbsp;4 on the [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] country charts.\n \nThe Sunny Cowgirls have also collaborated with [[Adam Brand (musician)|Adam Brand]] on \"Someday\".{{when|date=November 2020}}\n\nOn 1 September 2012 The Sunny Cowgirls performed at the 25th [[Trundle, New South Wales|Trundle]] Bush Tucker Day.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|+ List of studio albums, with selected details chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"6\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"65\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS]]<br /><ref>Peaks in Australia:\n* All except noted: {{cite web|url=https://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=The+Sunny+Cowgirls|title=Discography The Sunny Cowgirls|website=australian-charts.com|access-date=20 October 2022}}\n* ''Little Bit Rusty'' and ''Long Five Days'': {{cite Ryan|page=272}}</ref>\n! width=\"65\"| [[ARIA Charts|AUS Country]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Little Bit Rusty''\n|\n* Release date: 18 April 2005\n* Label: Compass Bros.\n* Format: [[Compact Disc|CD]], [[music download|download]]\n|80\n|4 \n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Long Five Days''\n|\n* Release date: 28 August 2006\n* Label: Compass Bros.\n* Format: CD, download\n|93\n|7\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Dust Will Settle''\n|\n* Release date: 2 August 2008\n* Label: Compass Bros.\n* Format: CD, download\n|37\n|2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Summer''\n|\n* Release date: 15 January 2010\n* Label: Compass Bros.\n* Format: CD, download\n|33\n|3\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''What We Do''\n|\n* Release date: 11 January 2013\n* Label: WJO Distribution\n* Format: CD, download\n|42\n|2\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''My Old Man''\n|\n* Release date: 29 August 2014\n* Label: WJO Distribution\n* Format: CD, download\n|85\n|12\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Here We Go''\n|\n* Release date: 30 September 2016\n* Label: [[ABC Music]], [[Universal Music Australia]]\n* Format: CD, download\n|13\n|3<br /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/charts/country-albums-chart/2016-10-10|title=ARIA Australian Top 40 Country Albums|publisher=Australian Recording Industry Association|date=10 October 2016|access-date=20 October 2022}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Happy Days''\n|\n* Release date: 20 September 2019\n* Label: [[ABC Music]], [[Universal Music Australia]]\n* Format: CD, download\n|0 unk\n|0 unk\n|}\n\n===Live albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" \n|+ List of live albums, with selected details\n!

From 1992 Dead Ringer Band released an extended play and four albums.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AMG\"/> For their first album, ''Red Desert Sky'' (November 1993), she was named as Kasey Jo Chambers, provided vocals and wrote four of its tracks.<ref name=\"NLA Red\"/><ref name=\"AMG RedDesert\"/> It was co-produced by the group with Eddie Sikorski at John Reynolds Recording Studio, [[Adelaide]].<ref name=\"NLA Red\"/><ref name=\"AMG RedDesert\"/>\n\nChambers met fellow country singer-songwriter [[Beccy Cole]] in mid-1989 in Adelaide, and she joined Dead Ringer Band on a tour through New South Wales before going solo.<ref name=\"AusStory Jul12\"/> Chambers later recalled, \"I never really met anyone at this point in my life that was of the same generation as me \u2013 a young girl who liked country music. And funnily enough the first song that I ever wrote in my life was called 'Beccy', about Beccy. It's the worst song you've ever heard in your whole life.\"<ref name=\"AusStory Jul12\"/> She cited [[Emmylou Harris]] as one of her primary influences, recalling that her parents had frequently Harris' music throughout her childhood.<ref name=\"Ryan\"/> The group ended when Chambers' parents divorced in the late 1990s, Diane moved to [[Norfolk Island]], and Bill moved to Sydney.<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=\"Age Oct02\"/>\n\n==Solo career==\n===1998\u20132002: ''The Captain'' to ''Barricades & Brickwalls''===\nChambers recorded her debut solo album, ''[[The Captain (album)|The Captain]]'', on Norfolk Island during July and August 1998 with her brother Nash producing and father Bill on guitar.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> United States country musicians, [[Buddy Miller|Buddy]] and [[Julie Miller]] added guitars and vocals to four tracks. ''The Captain'' was released in May 1999 via [[EMI Music Australia]] and in June 2000 in the US by [[Asylum Records]]. It peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] and No.&nbsp;1 on the related ARIA Country Albums chart.<ref name=\"AUS\"/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1999]] she won [[ARIA Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]] and in the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2000|following year]] she won [[ARIA Award for Best Female Artist|Best Female Artist]] for its [[The Captain (Kasey Chambers song)|title track]], which was issued in 2000.<ref name=\"ARIA list\"/>\n\n''The Captain'' was certified double platinum for shipment of 140,000 copies by [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) in 2001.<ref name=\"ARIA Cert01 Albs\"/> It reached the top&nbsp;50 of the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums in 2001.<ref name=\"Billb CountryA\"/> She toured the US as a support act to [[Lucinda Williams]] and later supported Emmylou Harris on the Australian leg of that artist's tour. \"The Captain\" was played in episode 8 (\"[[He Is Risen (The Sopranos)|He Is Risen]]\") of the third season of ''[[The Sopranos (season 3)|The Sopranos]]'', in April 2001.\n\nChambers' second studio album, ''[[Barricades & Brickwalls]]'', was released in September 2001 via EMI Music, which was also produced by Nash.<ref name=\"NLA Barricades\"/> It debuted at No.&nbsp;4 in the ARIA Albums Chart and peaked at No.&nbsp;1 in February of the following year.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AUS\"/> Its third single, \"[[Not Pretty Enough]]\" (January 2002), also peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the related ARIA Singles Chart in the same month.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AUS\"/> The track was written by Chambers and according to Australian musicologist, [[Ian McFarlane]], \"[it's] about being ignored by commercial radio.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> He cited her autobiography, ''A Little Bird Told Me'' (2011), \"'I wrote [it] as a song about feeling invisible... it was obvious that out in the music industry there was only one path for most young women \u2013 over-sexualised and over made up. To succeed you needed to look like Britney or Shakira.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nShe is the first Australian country music artist to have simultaneous No.&nbsp;1 single and album. Subsequent singles \"[[Million Tears]]\" (June 2002) and \"[[If I Were You (Kasey Chambers song)|If I Were You]]\" (October) also made the top&nbsp;40.<ref name=\"AUS\"/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2002]] she won three categories, [[ARIA Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], Best Female Artist and Best Country Album, for ''Barricades & Brickwalls''.<ref name=\"ARIA list\"/> It was certified seven times platinum in 2003 for shipment of at least 490,000 copies.<ref name=\"ARIA Creds03A\"/> In February 2002 it was released in the US, which peaked at No.&nbsp;104 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], topping the related Heatseeker Chart and reaching the top&nbsp;20 of their country music chart. It received \"generally favorable reviews\" according to aggregate site, [[Metacritic]], with a rating of 74% from 12 critics.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/>\n\nAustralian music journalist [[Ed Nimmervoll]] compared it to her first album, \"The musical cast remains essentially the same as ''The Captain'' with the addition of a 'rock' component via drummer Peter Luscombe and rhythm guitarist Dave Steel, and a guest appearance from 'punkabilly' band the Living End. The album also features appearances from Paul Kelly and American country's Lucinda Williams.\"<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Nimmervoll cited Chambers' observation, \"The last album showed my life story.

As a songwriter, she keeps getting better at writing about the stuff of everyday lives (love, lust, disappointment, getting on with life) with an uncommon degree of horse sense and attention to detail, and if anything, the new musical backdrops have added to the depth of her emotional landscapes.\"<ref name=\"Deming 3\"/> Its lead single, \"[[Nothing at All (Kasey Chambers song)|Nothing at All]]\" (July), reached the top&nbsp;ten.<ref name=\"AUS\"/>\n\n===2008\u20132010: ''Rattlin' Bones'' to ''Little Bird''===\n[[File:Kasey Chambers.jpg|Chambers at the ARIA Hall of Fame, July 2008|thumb|160px|alt=The 32-year-old Chambers wears a white dress with bare shoulders.

In early 1978, Williamson released his first compilation album under the ''Country Greats'' series. This was followed later in the year by his third album, ''Road to Town'', with contributions by other musicians including [[Tommy Emmanuel]] on guitar. Also that year Williamson formed a country music band, Crow, which performed on the pub and club circuit across Australia. In 1980 Crow were renamed as Sydney Radio, to play rock music with a reggae influence. The members used face paint, with Williamson disguised as the clown, Ludwig Leichhardt. Williamson penned rock and reggae numbers for the band some of which were recorded but never released. Since 1970 Williamson has had a friendship with radio presenter, [[John Laws]], who calls Williamson his 'little brother'. In 1977, Williamson recorded and released a single, \"It's a Grab It While It's Goin' Kind of Life\", which is a musical tribute to Laws. Up until Laws' first retirement on 25 June 2007, Williamson wrote and performed a series of [[jingle]]s for Laws' morning show on [[2UE]], and his final jingle was \"Hey good on ya Lawsie, you pulled the plug at last\". Laws made a successful comeback to radio broadcasting in February 2011, this time at [[2SM]], part of the Super Radio Network, and Williamson's jingles for his programme resumed.\n\n===1980s===\nIn early 1981 John Williamson's rock group, Sydney Radio, disbanded and he began playing solo in pubs, which attracted more new fans. He recorded a tribute song for [[ANZAC]]s, \"Diggers of the ANZAC (This Is Gallipoli)\", which was well received and issued as a single. Williamson met [[Pixie Jenkins]], a fiddle player, and the two toured together for several years. In April 1981 Williamson issued a single, \"The Breaker\", featuring narrated vocals by [[Bud Tingwell|Charles 'Bud' Tingwell]], which was inspired by the movie, ''[[Breaker Morant (film)|Breaker Morant]]'' (1980) (which had Tingwell as a supporting actor).<ref name=\"Breaker\">{{cite web | url = http://www.tvmem.com/OZST/ffilms/B-FFILM/BREAKERM.htm | title = ''Breaker Morant'' | publisher = Australian Soundtracks | editor = Dennis W.

Later that year, he issued ''Fair Dinkum J.W.'', featuring traditional Australian ballads, \"With My Swag upon My Shoulder\", \"Botany Bay\" and \"Brisbane Ladies\"; as well as originals, \"Country Football\", \"Kill the Night\", \"Wrinkles\" and \"(You've Gotta Be) Fair Dinkum\", a duet with Karen Johns.\n\nIn 1983 Williamson released his first solo live album, ''[[Singing in the Suburbs]]'' and another live album, ''[[The Smell of Gum Leaves]]'', in September 1984. It featured another comic track, \"I'm Fair Dinkum\". Williamson then launched his merchandise business, The Fair Dinkum Road Company, in Sydney. The album included his cover version of [[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]]'s 1971 single, \"[[I'll Be Gone (Spectrum song)|I'll Be Gone]]\", which he played using only guitar and harmonica. At the start of 1985 he founded an independent record label, Gumleaf Recordings.

In reaction to the news, he wrote a tribute tune, \"Wildlife Warriors: It's Time\". He was evidently emotional while performing both \"[[Give Me a Home Among the Gumtrees|Home Among the Gum Trees]]\" and \"True Blue\" at Irwin's memorial service inside the arena of his [[Australia Zoo]] Crocoseum. The service was filmed live-to-air and later released on DVD.

It was followed by 1998's ''[[Everything's Gonna Be Alright (Deana Carter album)|Everything's Gonna Be Alright]]'', 2003's ''[[I'm Just a Girl]]'', 2005's ''[[The Story of My Life (Deana Carter album)|The Story of My Life]]'', and 2007's ''[[The Chain (Deana Carter album)|The Chain]]''. Overall, Carter's albums have accounted for 14 singles, including three which reached Number One on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts: \"[[Strawberry Wine (Deana Carter song)|Strawberry Wine]]\", \"[[We Danced Anyway]]\", and \"[[How Do I Get There]]\".\n\n==Biography==\nCarter was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], the daughter of singer [[Fred Carter, Jr.]] Despite her famous father, she did not have a smooth path to a recording deal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.radio.com/2013/12/19/qa-strawberry-wine-singer-deana-carter-on-her-new-album-writing-with-kacey-musgraves-watching-nashville/|title=Q&A: 'Strawberry Wine' Singer Deana Carter on Her New Album, Writing with Kacey Musgraves & Watching 'Nashville'|date=December 1, 2013|access-date=March 23, 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323154955/http://news.radio.com/2013/12/19/qa-strawberry-wine-singer-deana-carter-on-her-new-album-writing-with-kacey-musgraves-watching-nashville/|archive-date=March 23, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> After an initial lack of success at age 17, she entered the [[University of Tennessee]], majoring in rehabilitation therapy and becoming a member of [[Alpha Delta Pi]] sorority.  During college, she sang at various campus locations, performing for the enjoyment of singing, rather than with the intent of pursuing a musical career.  She was also a local bartender at the Back Door Tavern (BDT) on Kingston Pike. After she graduated, she worked with recovering stroke and head injury patients. Although she found the work rewarding and worthwhile, she eventually realized that her first love was music, and decided to pursue the music career she had left.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2016/09/04/deana-carter-once-worked-stroke-patients/89593534/|title=Deana Carter once worked with stroke patients|work=The Tennessean|access-date=March 23, 2018|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCarter dated music video director [[Chris Hicky]] and had a son during their relationship; Gray Hayes Hicky was born in September 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/carter_deana/bio.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223021004/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/carter_deana/bio.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 23, 2003|title=Country Music \u2013 Music News, New Songs, Videos, Music Shows and Playlists from CMT|website=Cmt.com|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> On October 3, 2009, Carter married boyfriend Brandon Malone in Malibu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryschatter.com/2009/10/deana-carter-brandon-malone-marry-on-malibu-beach/|title=Deana Carter & Brandon Malone marry on Malibu Beach|date=October 11, 2009|website=Countryschatter.com|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> In November 2012, Carter filed for legal separation from Malone, citing [[irreconcilable differences]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Country Singer Deana Carter Files for Separation |url=http://www.allvoices.com/news/13417866-country-singer-deana-carter-files-for-separation |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130116144922/http://www.allvoices.com/news/13417866-country-singer-deana-carter-files-for-separation |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |publisher=All Voices |access-date=November 17, 2012 }}</ref> On July 6, 2018, Carter married Jim McPhail in a ceremony at the Pearl Hotel in Rosemary Beach, Fla.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://people.com/country/deana-carter-marries-jim-mcphail-wedding-exclusive/|title=Country \u2013 'Strawberry Wine' Singer Deana Carter Marries Jim McPhail in Sweet Wedding \u2014 See the Pics|website=people.com|access-date=March 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCarter has been a national spokeswoman for the [[National Kidney Foundation]]; her late father was a kidney transplant recipient.

That same tape led to a contract with Capitol Records that year.\n\nIn early 1995, she released her debut album, ''[[Did I Shave My Legs for This?]],'' in the UK on [[Patriot Records]]. However, the label folded shortly after the album's release. In 1996, Carter released her debut country single, \"[[Strawberry Wine (Deana Carter song)|Strawberry Wine]]\", which reached No. 1 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]]. ''Did I Shave My Legs for This?'' was released in North America (keeping only three of the original tracks) to great success. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;2 on the U.S. Top Country Albums chart and sold well over 5 million copies, and produced two further No. 1 hits in \"[[We Danced Anyway]]\" and \"[[How Do I Get There]]\".\n\nCarter was featured on the soundtrack to the 1997 animated film ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' for her rendition of \"[[Once Upon a December]]\". The track was made into a music video and received rotation on [[Country Music Television|CMT]] at the time \"How Do I Get There\" was charting as a radio single (since the single had no music video).\n\nAlso in 1997, she was nominated for Top New Female Vocalist at the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]], along with [[Mindy McCready]] and [[LeAnn Rimes]], but lost to Rimes.\n\n===Second album and departure from Capitol: ''Everything's Gonna Be Alright''===\nIn September 1998, Carter released her sixth single, \"[[Absence of the Heart]],\" as the lead-off single to her second album, ''[[Everything's Gonna Be Alright (Deana Carter album)|Everything's Gonna Be Alright]],'' which was released on October 20, 1998. The album peaked at No.&nbsp;6 and sold just enough to receive a [[gold single|Gold]] certification, far less than the sales of her debut album. The album produced a Top 20 in its lead single and three further singles, two of which were minor Top 40 hits (\"You Still Shake Me\" and \"[[Angels Working Overtime]]\").\n\nAfter her second album failed to follow up on the success of her debut, she attempted for several years to get new material out. But after dealing with a total of four label presidents and a failed attempt to push out a third album in 2001, she chose to end her relationship with Capitol Records over differences on creative direction.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1459786/20030131/carter_deana.jhtml]{{dead link|date=July 2024|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>\n\n===Return to the studio: ''Father Christmas'' and ''I'm Just a Girl''===\nAfter releasing her third studio album, ''Father Christmas,'' on [[Rounder Records]] in November 2001, and a divorce from husband Chris DiCroce, she relocated to Los Angeles.\n\nIn 2002, Carter signed with [[Arista Records|Arista Nashville]] and released her first single in three years. \"[[There's No Limit]],\" which became her sixth Top 20 hit with a peak of No.&nbsp;14 in early 2003, served as the lead-off single to her fourth studio album, ''[[I'm Just a Girl]],'' which was released on March 18, 2003. The title track was released as the album's second single, and was a minor Top 40 hit. No further singles were released from the album, and Carter once again parted ways with her record label.\n\n===Turning to independent labels: ''The Story of My Life'' and ''The Chain''===\nIn 2004, Carter signed with independent record label [[Vanguard Records]]. She released the song \"(Bleep) Texas\" in March 2005, but it failed to chart and was shortly replaced with \"One Day at a Time,\" which served as the lead single to her fifth studio album, ''[[The Story of My Life (Deana Carter album)|The Story of My Life]].'' It only remained on the chart for five weeks and peaked at No.&nbsp;55. ''The Story of My Life'' peaked at No.&nbsp;26 on the U.S. Country Albums chart, and all further singles (\"The Girl You Left Me For,\" \"Sunny Day,\" and \"In a Heartbeat\") failed to chart. Despite having less success, Carter had more artistic freedom with this album and was able to write (or co-write) and produce all 11 tracks.\n\n''Live in Concert,'' Carter's first live album, was released in early 2007 through Big Band Concert Series. The album includes one previously-unreleased song, \"Angels of the Heart,\" as well as other concert favorites. Although released in 2007, all of the live performances on the album were recorded in 1998.\n\nCarter's sixth studio album, ''[[The Chain (Deana Carter album)|The Chain]],'' was released on October 9, 2007. ''The Chain'' was a cover album, that she recorded as a tribute to her father (who performed guitar on many of the original versions of the covers found on the album). Many of the tracks also featured the original artists as duet partners, such as [[Dolly Parton]] (on \"Love Is Like a Butterfly\") and [[Willie Nelson]] (on \"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]\"). The album was unsuccessful; it debuted and peaked at No.&nbsp;60, and its only single (the duet version of \"On the Road Again\" with Nelson) failed to chart.\n\nCarter was ranked No.&nbsp;81 on the ''100 Greatest Women'' (of Country Music) by Country Universe in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.countryuniverse.net/2008/04/13/100-greatest-women-81-deana-carter/|title=100 Greatest Women, #81: Deana Carter|date=April 14, 2008|website=Countryuniverse.net|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Return to music and career today: ''Southern Way of Life''===\nAfter releasing ''The Chain'', Carter took some time off from recording music to spend at home with her son.\n\nIn an interview with Jay Cooper of Slither Productions, Carter reported that she had been writing music for her next album, with hopes of releasing the record sometime in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deana.com/|title=Deana Carter|website=Deana Carter|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> It was announced in March 2010 that Deana Carter had signed a record deal with Warner Bros. Nashville/Chappel Music.\n\nIn 2010, [[Kenny Chesney]] covered \"[[You and Tequila]],\" a song co-written by Carter with [[Matraca Berg]] for the album ''I'm Just a Girl'', and included it on his album ''[[Hemingway's Whiskey]]''. Chesney's version was later released as the album's fourth single in May 2011 and features guest vocals from [[Grace Potter]]. It peaked at number 3 in September 2011, and was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2011 CMA Awards.\n\nDeana Carter's third studio and holiday album, ''Father Christmas'', was re-released on December 13, 2011, via Adamant Records, ten years after its initial release.\n\nIn 2013, Carter formed her own record label, Little Nugget Records.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Edward|title=Deana Carter Out With Southern Way of Life in December|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1719477/deana-carter-out-with-southern-way-of-life-in-december/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213002515/http://www.cmt.com/news/1719477/deana-carter-out-with-southern-way-of-life-in-december/|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 13, 2014|access-date=December 11, 2014|publisher=Country Music Television|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref> ''Southern Way of Life'', Carter's seventh studio album, released on December 2, 2013.

They won more than 40 awards from the Saskatchewan Country Music Association, including Entertainer of the Decade in 1999.<ref>[http://www.weyburnreview.com/News/1999/9912/johner.html Johner Brothers named Entertainer of the Decade<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\nBrothers Ken Johner and [[Brad Johner]] grew up in Saskatchewan playing music in their family band. In 1988, they teamed up together to form '''The Johner Brothers'''.<ref>[http://www.techmgt.ca/BJconcerts/artists/brad_johner.htm Brad Johner<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2000 the pair took home a Prairie Music Award for their video and production skills.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/singer-jann-arden-tops-music-awards/article1042761/ \"Singer Jann Arden tops music awards\"]. SASKATOON \u2014 ''Globe and Mail'', Oct. 02, 2000</ref>\n\nThe duo signed with [[Warner Music Canada]] and released their first album, ''Some Kind of Magic'', in 1991. Two singles from the album reached the Canadian country singles chart, including the top 40 \"Right On Time.\" That same year, the Johner's won four awards at the Saskatchewan Country Music Awards (SCMA), including Group of the Year, Single of the Year, Song of the Year, and Most Promising. They were also named Group or Duo of the Year by the [[Canadian Country Music Association]].\n\nIn 1992, The Johner Brothers won seven awards from the SCMA, including Entertainer, Group, Duo, Song, Single and Album of the Year. They released their second studio album, ''My Brother and Me'', in 1993. Seven singles from the album found their way to the Canadian country singles chart, including the top 20 hit \"Starting Right Now\", and their duet with [[Lisa Brokop]], \"Light In My Life.\" The duo won another four awards at the 1993 SCMA Awards, including Entertainer, Group and Single of the Year.\n\nThe Johner Brothers became one of only a few Canadian country music acts to release a Christmas album with the release of 1993's ''One Winter's Night''. 1994 proved to be a banner year for the Johner's, when they won no less than 11 awards from SCMA. Among their wins were Entertainer, Group, Song, Single, Video and Album of the Year, along with Vocal Collaboration of the Year for their duet with [[Lisa Brokop]].\n\nTheir success continued in 1995 with the release of their third album, ''Ten More Miles''. The album charted 5 singles, including the Top 25 songs \"Hillbilly Country Boy\" and the title track. They racked up another 7 awards at the SCMA Awards the same year, including their fourth straight win as Entertainer of the Year, and their fifth as Group of the Year. Their television special '''One Winter's Night''' also won an SCMA Award for TV Show of the Year.\n\nThe Johner Brothers took some time off before the release of their fourth studio album, ''The Perfect Life'', in 1999.

Her older brother, [[Greg Storer]], is also a country music singer-songwriter and the siblings have recorded and performed together.\n\n==Early career==\nSara Bettine Storer was born in October 1973 in [[Wemen, Victoria|Wemen]] where her parents, Lindsay and Fay<!-- maiden name not seen in sources --> Storer, farmed wheat and cattle on a {{convert|5000|acre|ha}} property.<ref name=\"APRA Buffalo\"/><ref name=\"Dawson\"/> Her three brothers, including Doug and [[Greg Storer]], became farmers, she also has two older sisters.<ref name=\"Dawson\"/><ref name=\"Fidler inter\"/> She attended school in nearby, [[Robinvale]].<ref name=\"Thorburn\"/>\n\nStorer later recalled, \"I wasn't much of a farmer's daughter. Three brothers \u2013 they did everything and they enjoyed it. I would rather sit at home and help out with mum really. I was scared of cattle. I always got yelled at cos I was in the wrong spot you know, didn't really know what I was doing. I was never very good.\"<ref name=\"Fidler inter\"/> She completed her tertiary studies in Melbourne, becoming a teacher and then headed north in the mid-1990s. Living in [[Camooweal, Queensland|Camooweal]], she met a retired [[domestic buffalo|water buffalo]] shooter, Harry Chandler, whose stories inspired her to write, \"Buffalo Bill\", her first song.<ref name=\"APRA Buffalo\"/><ref name=\"Dawson\"/>\n\nNine months later, Storer moved to [[Katherine, Northern Territory]], where she taught kindergarten level at Casuarina Street Primary School.<ref name=\"ABC Bio\"/> After a year there she taught at [[Kalkarindji]] ({{convert|466|km|mi}} southwest of Katherine), for four years.<ref name=\"ABC Bio\"/><ref name=\"AMO Bio\"/> Later she co-wrote and recorded a track, \"Children of the Gurindji\", with [[Kev Carmody]], for her compilation album, ''[[Calling Me Home \u2013 The Best of Sara Storer]]'' (April 2010).\n\nCarmody told [[Rhoda Roberts]] of ''Deadly Vibe'', \"[Storer] came up here about 12 months ago and we did a song about the Gurindji kids together. The whole basis of the song was, when she went to teach at Kalkarindji \u2013 she taught there for a number of years \u2013 she said that she came away with the kids teaching her more than she taught them, and that was the chorus of the song.\"<ref name=\"Roberts\"/>\n\nWhen not teaching she started playing at parties across the territory. She won a talent quest at [[Adelaide River, Northern Territory|Adelaide River]] which provided a scholarship to the College of Country Music, held two weeks before the [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]], in January 2000. There she met [[Garth Porter]], former keyboard player with [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]], and a record producer of fellow singers, [[Lee Kernaghan]] and [[Gina Jeffreys]]. Porter worked with Storer to record six tracks which he showcased to [[ABC Music]]'s owners, who agreed to sign her to their label.\n\n==Recording career==\n===2000\u20132009===\nSara Storer released her debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Buffalo]]'', in August 2000 via ABC Music/[[Universal Music Australia]] with Porter producing.

In January 2004 at the Country Music Awards of Australia she was nominated for eight Golden Guitars, and won seven of them \u2013 a then-record number of trophies at one ceremony:<ref name=\"ARIA Report 804\"/><ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> Vocal Collaboration, Single of the Year and Song of the Year all for \"Raining on the Plains\" (with [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]]); Female Vocalist of the Year and Album of the Year for ''Beautiful Circle'', Songwriter of the Year for \"Raining on the Plains\" (co-written with Porter and Greg Storer); Bush Ballad of the Year for \"Boss Drovers Pride\" and Heritage Song of the Year for \"Drover's Call\".<ref name=\"CMAoA 2000s\"/>\n\nThe album reached No.&nbsp;50 on the ARIA Albums Chart in March 2004.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> It also peaked at No.&nbsp;11 on the Australasian Artists, No.&nbsp;1 on the Hitseekers and No.&nbsp;2 on the Country albums charts.<ref name=\"ARIA Report 732\"/> She promoted it by touring with Australian country singer, [[Troy Cassar-Daley]],<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> and United Kingdom singer, [[Charlie Landsborough]], including playing to an audience of over 40,000 people at the [[Gympie Muster]], Queensland.

She's found her own way to sing the stories that are all around her and then inside her bubbling out. She doesn't copy over-emotive, fake sincere twangy country singers from overseas. She's found her own restraint and steel and lets her songs do their sweet, sly work.\"<ref name=\"ABC Bio\"/>\n\nIn December 2005 [[Deborah Conway]] established the Broad Festival project, \"the idea that I would pull these different women performers together from different genres and call it Broad\".<ref name=\"Elliott\"/> Storer joined Conway, [[Katie Noonan]], [[Ruby Hunter]] and [[Clare Bowditch]] where they performed their own and each other's songs on an Australian tour.<ref name=\"Elliott\"/><ref name=\"Broad2005\"/> Conway observed, \"Sara you're a gorgeous surprise package, quiet and unassuming offstage; onstage, you had us pissing ourselves every night. I love that simple yet deceptive guitar playing and those haunting songs, which have such a piercing truth to them.\"<ref name=\"Broad2005\"/>\n\nIn March 2006 Storer played at the Queens' Lunch during the [[2006 Commonwealth Games|Melbourne Commonwealth Games]]. In February and March 2007 she performed a double-headlining tour with fellow country musician, [[Felicity Urquhart]].<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> In November of that year she released her fourth studio album, ''[[Silver Skies]]'', which reached the ARIA Albums Chart top&nbsp;100 and No.&nbsp;3 on the Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> It was co-produced by Cunningham and Matt Fell for her new label, [[EMI Records]].<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/><ref name=\"Dawson 3\"/>\n\nIts lead single, \"Land Cries Out\", was released in September 2007, which Andrew Tijs of ''Undercover News'' described, \"an achingly beautiful rumination on the bitterness of being forced to leave the land you love \u2013 an all too common scenario during the recent drought. With this heartfelt subject matter, Storer has branched away from traditional country sounds... [she] uses electric guitar and drums to complement the lament.\"<ref name=\"Tijs 2\"/> From late January to early February 2008 she supported a tour by American singer-songwriter, [[Suzanne Vega]].<ref name=\"Tijs\"/>\n\nFrom 2007 to 2009 she joined [[Beccy Cole]] and [[Gina Jeffreys]] to form a country music trio, [[Songbirds (group)|Songbirds]].<ref name=\"Morris 1\"/> The group released a live DVD, ''You've Got a Friend: Live in Concert'', on 1 May 2009, which was accredited by [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]] as a gold album by the end of that year.<ref name=\"ARIA Acred 09\"/> It was recorded at Tamworth in January 2009.<ref name=\"Dawson 2\"/> It was shown at cinemas from 29 April of that year, Storer opined, \"I'm really proud of the Songbirds: You've Got a Friend live filming but am worried how pregnant I will look shown on a big screen.\"<ref name=\"Cashmere 1\"/>\n\nStorer had encouraged her brother Greg, a cropping farmer from \"Strawin\" {{convert|60|km|mi}} north-west of [[Warren, New South Wales]], to write music, she has performed his work, including duets with him and she is recorded on his debut single, \"When I Was a Boy\" (December 2009).<ref name=\"Land Warren\"/> He recalled, \"Sara started off telling me to write some lyrics and then every now and then she said I should get up and have a sing at one of her shows. It was absolutely terrifying to get up and sing in front of some great artists... [its] a bit addictive. The trick is to never put the guitar away \u2013 in between wrestling with the kids or doing something else, I can just pick up the guitar.\"<ref name=\"Land Warren\"/>\n\n===2010\u20132020===\nIn April 2010, Storer released her first compilation album, ''Calling Me Home \u2013 The Best of Sara Storer'', which reached No.&nbsp;28 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No.&nbsp;1 on the Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> She had recorded three new tracks, \"Calling Me Home\", \"Children of the Gurundi\" (with Kev Carmody) and \"Tears\".

We need a little practice run otherwise we could end up a train smash.\"<ref name=\"Hamley\"/> ''Lovegrass'', which was produced by Matt Fell, peaked at No.&nbsp;25 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No.&nbsp;5 on the Country Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> In 2015 Storer recorded \"Song for Grace\", a duet with Lee Kernaghan for his album, ''[[Spirit of the Anzacs (album)|Spirit of the Anzacs]]'' (March 2015).\n\nIn March 2016 Storer released her sixth studio album, ''[[Silos (album)|Silos]]'', also produced by Fell, which peaked at No.&nbsp;30 on the ARIA Albums Chart and No.&nbsp;3 on the Country Music Albums Chart.<ref name=\"AUS Charts\"/> It earned the musician her sixth nomination for [[ARIA Award for Best Country Album]] and her first win in the category, at [[ARIA Music Awards of 2016|that year's]] ceremony.<ref name=\"ARIA List\"/> At the Country Music Awards of Australia in January 2017 she received her 21st Golden Guitar \u2013 the most by any female artist.<ref name=\"CMAoA 2010s\"/><ref name=\"Young\"/>\n\nIn April 2019, Storer released her 7th studio album, ''[[Raindance (Sara Storer album)|Raindance]]''.\n\n===2020\u2013present===\nIn January 2023, Sara will feature on the self-titled album by Storer, alongside her brother Greg and Greg's daughters Bonnie & Pip.<ref name=\"storer by storer\"/>\n\n== Personal life==\nWhen Sara Storer was 18, her parents moved from Wemen, Victoria to a farming property near Warren, New South Wales.<ref name=\"Dawson 2\"/><ref name=\"OSullivan\"/> Storer had lived in Melbourne, moved to Camooweal, North Queensland and then to Katherine and Kalkarindji, Northern Territory in the mid-1990s.

When he was 16, Brad won a National Talent Contest during Country Music Week in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] in 1982.<ref>[https://esask.uregina.ca/entry/johner_brad_1969-.html Brad Johner (1969- )]</ref><ref name=autogenerated>[http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=333 Country Music News Canadian country Music Artists CD's CDs CD Nashville report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He spent six years maintaining his solo career before teaming up with his brother Ken to form [[The Johner Brothers]] in 1988. After 14 years, six albums (including their ''Greatest Hits''), 26 singles, one [[Canadian Country Music Association]] (CCMA) award and more than 40 awards from the Saskatchewan Country Music Association (SCMA), including Entertainer of the Decade, Ken decided to retire from the music business to pursue other interests in 2002.\n\nAfter the Johner Brothers dissolved, Brad returned to his solo career. He moved to [[Saskatoon]] with his wife Rhea and their five sons to begin work on his first solo album with producer Bart McKay.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=333 Country Music News Canadian country Music Artists CD's CDs CD Nashville report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The album, ''[[Free (Brad Johner album)|Free]]'', was released by [[Royalty Records]] in 2003.

The following year, he released his debut solo album, ''[[P.O. Box 423]]''. The first four singles from the project all reached the top 10 on the Canadian country chart, including \"[[Anita Got Married]],\" which became Steele's first No.&nbsp;1 song. He was nominated for the Vista Rising Star Award by the [[Canadian Country Music Association]] (CCMA) in 1996, but lost to [[Terri Clark]]. He also received a nomination for Male Vocalist of the Year. In 1997, the [[Juno Award]]s nominated Steele for Best Country Male Vocalist, and also the all-genre Best New Solo Artist. He won his first award, Vocal Event of the Year, at the 1997 CCMA Awards for his duet with [[Lisa Brokop]], \"Two Names On An Overpass.\"\n\nSteele's second album, ''[[This Is the Life (Duane Steele album)|This Is the Life]]'', was released in September 1997. The disc included a cover of [[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s \"[[If You Could Read My Mind (song)|If You Could Read My Mind]].\" The first two singles, \"Tell The Girl\" and \"If I Could Just Get To You,\" both reached the Canadian top 10. Steele was again nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year in 1998 at both the CCMA Awards and the Juno Awards. When subsequent singles failed to reach the top 30, Steele and Mercury parted ways.<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://archive.today/20120711074656/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/S/Steele_Duane/1998/10/06/749944.html CANOE \u2013 JAM!

Originally a session player in many bands, he has released many award-winning recordings as a solo artist. In June 2010, Emmanuel was appointed a Member of the [[Order of Australia]] (AM);<ref name=\"It's an Honour: AM\">{{cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/1142663 |title=It's an Honour \u2013 Honours \u2013 Search Australian Honours |publisher=Itsanhonour.gov.au |date=14 June 2010 |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> in 2011, he was inducted into the [[Australian Roll of Renown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcmf.com.au/What-s-On/Roll-of-Renown/ |title=Roll of Renown|publisher=TCMF |access-date=21 August 2018}}</ref> In 2019, he was listed by MusicRadar as the best [[acoustic guitar]]ist in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|date=12 December 2019|first=Matt |last=Parker |title=The 10 best acoustic guitarists in the world today|url=https://www.musicradar.com/news/the-10-best-acoustic-guitarists-in-the-world-today|access-date=2021-08-03|website=MusicRadar|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\nOne of six children, Emmanuel was born in [[Muswellbrook, New South Wales]], Australia, in 1955. He received his first guitar in 1959 at age four and was taught by his mother to accompany her playing [[lap steel guitar]]. In 1961, at the age of six, he heard [[Chet Atkins]] playing on the radio. He vividly remembers that moment and said it greatly inspired him as a musician.<ref name=\"pritcher\">{{cite web |url=http://users.adam.com.au/donald/markinter.htm |title=The Official Tommy Emmanuel Web Site \u2013 Interview |publisher=Users.adam.com.au |date=19 April 1997 |access-date=17 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010192609/http://users.adam.com.au/donald/markinter.htm |archive-date=10 October 2013 }}</ref>\n\nBy the age of six, he was a working professional musician. Recognizing the musical talents of Emmanuel and his older brother, [[Phil Emmanuel|Phil]], their father created a family band, sold their home, and took his family on the road. With the family living in two station wagons, much of Emmanuel's childhood was spent touring Australia, playing rhythm guitar, and rarely going to school. After their father died in 1966, Australian Country Music star [[Buddy Williams (country musician)|Buddy Williams]] approached the family and asked permission to take the Emmanuel brothers on the road with his touring show travelling around Australia. Tommy Emmanuel would go on to record a number of Buddy Williams albums in the early 1970s. The family settled in Parkes after the [[New South Wales Department of Education]] insisted that the Emmanuel children had to go to school regularly. <ref name=\"cmonline\">{{cite web|url=http://www.countrymusiconline.net/tommyemmanuel.html |title=Tommy Emmanuel: c.g.p |publisher=Countrymusiconline.net|access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn his teen years, Tommy Emmanuel moved to Sydney, and was noticed nationally when he won a string of talent contests. <ref name=\"pritcher\" /><ref name=\"musicfrisk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfrisk.com/picture/interview/tommy.emmanuel.fingerstyle.02.14.2003.php |title=Tommy Emmanuel Interview |publisher=Music Frisk |date=14 February 2003 |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> By the late 1970s, he was playing drums with his brother Phil in the group Goldrush as well as doing session work on numerous albums and jingles. He gained further prominence in the late 1970s as the lead guitarist in the Southern Star Band, the backing group for vocalist [[Doug Parkinson]]. During 1986\u20131988 and 1995, he joined the lineup of the leading New Zealand/Australian 1970s rock group [[Dragon (band)|Dragon]] that had reformed in 1982, touring widely with them, including a 1987 tour with [[Tina Turner]]; he left the group to embark on a solo career.\n\nIn 1994, Australian music veteran [[John Farnham]] invited him to play the guitar next to Stuart Fraser from [[Noiseworks]] for the ''Concert for Rwanda''. Emmanuel had previously been a member of Farnham's band during the early 1980s and featured on the album ''[[Uncovered (John Farnham album)|Uncovered]]'' and rejoined after the 1994 concert.\n\nIn July 1999, [[Chet Atkins]] commented that Emmanuel was a \"fearless\" [[fingerpicking]] guitar player and awarded Tommy and four others ([[John Knowles (guitarist)|John Knowles]], [[Marcel Dadi]], [[Jerry Reed]], and [[Steve Wariner]]) the \"Certified Guitar Player\" title.<ref name=Certified>{{cite news|last1=St. James|first1=Adam|title=Tommy Emmanuel: Certified Guitar Player|url=https://www.guitar.com/articles/tommy-emmanuel-certified-guitar-player|access-date=3 June 2019|publisher=Guitar.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111083823/https://guitar.com/articles/tommy-emmanuel-certified-guitar-player|archive-date=11 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Certified Wariner\">{{cite magazine|last1=Thompson|first1=Art|title=Steve Wariner|url=http://www.guitarplayer.com/artists/1013/steve-wariner/11636|magazine=[[Guitar Player]]|access-date=25 October 2015|date=1 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nEmmanuel and his brother Phil performed live in Sydney at the closing ceremony of the [[Summer Olympics]] in 2000.

Although Emmanuel's playing incorporates a multitude of musical influences and styles, including [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]] and rock, this type of [[country music|country]] finger-style playing is at the core of his technique. While Emmanuel has never had formal music training and does not read or write music, his natural musical ability, intrinsic sense of rhythm, and charisma gained him fans from all over the world. As a solo performer, he never plays to a setlist and uses a minimum of effects onstage.<ref name=\"musicfrisk\" /> He usually completes studio recordings in one take.\n\n[[File:2024-09-18 Concert of Tommy Emmanuel and Mike Dawes at UdK Berlin Konzertsaal (Martin Rulsch) 163.jpg|thumb|Emmanuel uses a snare-drum brush to emulate the sound of a percussion kit]]\nIn his solo shows, he mainly plays guitars made by [[Maton]], an Australian guitar manufacturer. He usually travels with two custom Maton EBG808 TE models and one TE1 model, both of which are Tommy Emmanuel artist signature models.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maton.com.au/product/te-series|title=The Maton TE Series - Maton Guitars Australia|access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref> He has played Maton guitars for most of his career and is somewhat of an ambassador for the company due to his long-standing association with the brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maton.com.au/artists/tommy-emmanuel|title=Tommy Emmanuel - Maton Guitars Australia|access-date=19 September 2016}}</ref> Emmanuel is known for the battered and worn-down appearances of his guitars; a result of his dynamic, energetic playing and percussive techniques. One of his signature performances, for example, involves striking the whole body of the guitar in various places with his hands or a drummer's [[Drum brush#Brushes|snare-drum brush]] to emulate the sound of a percussion kit.\n\nEmmanuel usually keeps one Maton EBG808 in standard guitar tuning (E-A-D-G-B-E), while he tunes his second Maton EBG808 to D-G-D-G-B-E (G6 tuning) and his TE1 to C{{music|sharp}}-F{{music|sharp}}-B-E-G{{music|sharp}}-C{{music|sharp}}. He generally uses 0.12 gauge (light) strings on one EBG808 and 0.13 gauge (medium) strings on the second Maton EBG808 and on the TE1. This allows him to quickly change tuning by swapping between guitars during a show if needed, rather than spending time onstage re-tuning one guitar.{{Cn|date=December 2023}}\n\nEmmanuel often curls his left thumb around the neck of the guitar onto the [[fretboard]] to play some notes, rather than using only his fingers to play \u2014 contrary to how classical guitarists play, but not unusual for jazz and country guitarists. He frequently plays common three-finger chord shapes with just two fingers. He commonly uses a [[thumbpick]], a flat pick ([[plectrum]]), his fingers, or a combination of these in his playing, a style known as [[hybrid picking]]. Amongst his trademark rapid virtuoso licks and cascading harmonic progressions, he often uses a technique that imitated an electric guitar's tremolo system on acoustic guitar \u2014 by pressing the palm of his right hand against the [[Sound board (music)|sound board]] of the guitar near the neck joint, while maintaining forward pressure with his left hand on the top of the [[headstock]]. The guitar neck slightly bends away from the body and consequently affects the pitch of the strings to achieve the desired sound.{{Cn|date=December 2023}}\n\n==Influences==\nAs a young man in Australia, Emmanuel wrote to his hero [[Chet Atkins]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Eventually, Atkins replied with words of encouragement and a long-standing invitation to drop by to visit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://justjazzguitar.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=329&Itemid=52 |title=Just Jazz Guitar Online \u2013 Tommy Emmanuel Interview |publisher=Justjazzguitar.com |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, Emmanuel and Atkins recorded as a duo, releasing the album ''[[The Day Finger Pickers Took Over the World]]''. It would be Atkins's last album, with the exception of \"Solo Sessions\" which Atkins' estate released posthumously.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Chet Atkins: Solo Sessions|url=https://www.misterguitar.us/news/solorelease.html|access-date=2021-04-25|website=www.misterguitar.us}}</ref> Emmanuel and Atkins appeared together on [[The Nashville Network]]'s 'Country Christmas' in late 1997, and on that occasion, Atkins stated about him: \"He is one of the greatest guitar players I've ever seen.\" Atkins gave Emmanuel the guitar on which [[Arthur \"Guitar Boogie\" Smith]] recorded \"Guitar Boogie\", one of the foundation performances of the blues guitar world and a regular feature of Emmanuel's shows.\n\nIn July 1999, at the 15th Annual Chet Atkins Appreciation Society Convention,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.misterguitar.com/caas/index.html |title=The Chet Atkins Appreciation Society |publisher=Misterguitar.com |date=21 December 1997 |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> Atkins presented Emmanuel with a Certified Guitar Player award, an honour Chet personally bestowed to only four guitarists.<ref name=\"pritcher\" /> This award gains its fame from being bestowed by Atkins himself, a widely recognised leader in guitar music.
