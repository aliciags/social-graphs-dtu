Before beginning his musical career in the late 1990s, he was a [[professional wrestler]] in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), until an injury forced him to retire.\n\nBrock signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]]' Nashville division in the late 1990s, releasing three studio albums \u2013 1998's ''[[Chad Brock (album)|Chad Brock]]'', 2000's ''[[Yes! (Chad Brock album)|Yes!]]'', and 2001's ''[[III (Chad Brock album)|III]]'' \u2014 for WB. Those albums, overall, produced seven singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country music charts, including the number-one hit \"[[Yes! (song)|Yes!]]\" and the Top Five \"[[Ordinary Life]]\". Brock parted company with Warner Bros. in 2002, and signed to [[Broken Bow Records]] a year later; although he released five singles for them (of which four charted), his album for Broken Bow was not released, and he left that label as well.\n\nBrock also began a career in the late 2000s as a disc jockey at [[WQYK-FM]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], where he and parody singer [[Cledus T. Judd]] co-host a morning show.\n\n==Biography==\nChad Brock was born July 31, 1963, in [[Ocala, Florida]]. In high school, Brock played football and was offered a post-secondary scholarship to play sports.<ref name=\"all\"/> He turned down the scholarship, however, as his experiences in the school choir had convinced him to pursue a singing career.<ref name=\"all\"/> Brock moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to follow this dream, but he met with little success at first.<ref name=\"all\"/> In 1994, he signed a record deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]], but he did not release any music for over three years.<ref name=\"winsock\">{{cite web|title=An interview with Chad Brock|last=Gueningsman|first=Ryan|work=Winsock Festival|url=http://www.winstockfestival.com/pages/interviews/2002/brock.html|accessdate=January 22, 2008}}</ref>\n\n==Professional Wrestling Career==\nWarner Brothers and WCW got together to cross-promote Brock, and he trained at [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s training facility, the [[WCW Power Plant]]. Chad wrestled for WCW from 1994 to 1996, until an injury forced him to retire. He also appeared at several WCW events in 1999, where he was briefly involved in an angle with [[Curt Hennig]].\n\n==Musical career==\nIn 1998, Brock released his debut single, \"Evangeline\", which peaked at number 51 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. That song's follow-up, the ballad \"[[Ordinary Life]]\", went on to become Brock's first major hit,<ref name=\"all\"/> peaking at number 3 on the same chart, as well as number 39 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Following that song's success, Brock released his [[Chad Brock (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Its third and final single, \"Lightning Does The Work\", reached number 19 in 1999.\n\nBrock's fourth chart single was a rewrite of [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]'s signature song \"[[A Country Boy Can Survive]]\", a number 2 hit for Williams in 1981. Chad's version, which featured Williams and [[George Jones]], was entitled \"A Country Boy Can Survive (Y2K Version)\", was re-written with lyrics pertaining to the [[Year 2000 problem]] (abbreviated Y2K). The song served as the first single from Brock's 2000 album ''[[Yes! (Chad Brock album)|Yes!]]''. Its second single was the title track, which went on to become Brock's only number-one ''Billboard'' hit,<ref name=\"all\"/> as well as a number 22 hit on the Hot 100 chart. The third and last single from ''Yes!'' (\"The Visit\") peaked at number 21.\n\n2001 saw the release of Brock's third and final album for Warner Bros.. Entitled ''[[III (Chad Brock album)|III]]'', it was less successful than its predecessor.<ref name=\"all\"/> ''III'' had only one chart entry in \"Tell Me How\", which failed to make the Top 40. This album also reprised Brock's three highest-charting singles (\"Yes!\", \"Ordinary Life\" and \"Lightning Does The Work\"). Shortly thereafter, he signed to [[Broken Bow Records]], then a newly formed independent label. Although he released five singles for Broken Bow, four of which made the charts, he never put out a full album.\n\nBrock left Nashville in 2005 to co-host a morning show on the [[Tampa, Florida]], station [[WQYK-FM]] along with country music parodist [[Cledus T. Judd]]. He remained on the morning show on WQYK-FM, while Cletus moved on to the Bull in Atlanta. In 2007, Brock signed with Rocky Comfort Records, a label which was started by [[Tracy Lawrence]],<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070809085450/http://www.cmt.com/artists/news/1552954/20070221/brock_chad.jhtml CMT.com : Chad Brock : After Three-Year Lull, Tracy Lawrence Has New Album<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> although he did not release anything for the label. His first single in four years, \"Put A Redneck In The White House\", was released in August 2008 on the Straight Shooter label. In February 2010, Brock left WQYK-FM to begin his new position as Director of Programming for the new cable channel [[The Country Network]] but left TCN in early 2011.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/chad-brock/chart-history/clp/|title=Chad Brock - Chart History (Top Country Albums)|magazine=Billboard|access-date=February 27, 2023}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/chad-brock/chart-history/tlp/|title=Chad Brock - Chart History (Billboard 200)|magazine=Billboard|access-date=February 27, 2023}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]<br/><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/chad-brock/chart-history/tln/|title=Chad Brock - Chart History (Heatseekers Albums)|magazine=Billboard|access-date=February 27, 2023}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]<br/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/films-videos-sound-recordings/rpm/Pages/list.aspx?OCRText=Chad+Brock&ChartEn=Country+Albums%2fCDs&|title=Search results for Chad Brock - Country Albums/CDs|work=RPM|date=July 17, 2013 |access-date=February 27, 2023}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Chad Brock (album)|Chad Brock]]''\n| \n* Release date: October 20, 1998\n* Label: [[Warner Records|Warner Nashville]]\n| 37\n| \u2014\n| 31\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Yes!

He began touring throughout the state of [[Texas]], playing various clubs throughout the state. [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]] signed Steiner in 2001, and his debut single, \"[[What If She's an Angel]]\", was released that year, followed by the album ''[[Then Came the Night]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The single was added to the playlists of nearly 100 of the stations on ''Billboard'''s panel in one week.<ref>[http://countrymusic.about.com/library/bltssbio.htm Tommy Shane Steiner bio]</ref> \"What If She's an Angel\" peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' U.S. [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts.

They won more than 40 awards from the Saskatchewan Country Music Association, including Entertainer of the Decade in 1999.<ref>[http://www.weyburnreview.com/News/1999/9912/johner.html Johner Brothers named Entertainer of the Decade<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==History==\nBrothers Ken Johner and [[Brad Johner]] grew up in Saskatchewan playing music in their family band. In 1988, they teamed up together to form '''The Johner Brothers'''.<ref>[http://www.techmgt.ca/BJconcerts/artists/brad_johner.htm Brad Johner<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In 2000 the pair took home a Prairie Music Award for their video and production skills.<ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/singer-jann-arden-tops-music-awards/article1042761/ \"Singer Jann Arden tops music awards\"]. SASKATOON \u2014 ''Globe and Mail'', Oct. 02, 2000</ref>\n\nThe duo signed with [[Warner Music Canada]] and released their first album, ''Some Kind of Magic'', in 1991. Two singles from the album reached the Canadian country singles chart, including the top 40 \"Right On Time.\" That same year, the Johner's won four awards at the Saskatchewan Country Music Awards (SCMA), including Group of the Year, Single of the Year, Song of the Year, and Most Promising. They were also named Group or Duo of the Year by the [[Canadian Country Music Association]].\n\nIn 1992, The Johner Brothers won seven awards from the SCMA, including Entertainer, Group, Duo, Song, Single and Album of the Year. They released their second studio album, ''My Brother and Me'', in 1993. Seven singles from the album found their way to the Canadian country singles chart, including the top 20 hit \"Starting Right Now\", and their duet with [[Lisa Brokop]], \"Light In My Life.\" The duo won another four awards at the 1993 SCMA Awards, including Entertainer, Group and Single of the Year.\n\nThe Johner Brothers became one of only a few Canadian country music acts to release a Christmas album with the release of 1993's ''One Winter's Night''. 1994 proved to be a banner year for the Johner's, when they won no less than 11 awards from SCMA. Among their wins were Entertainer, Group, Song, Single, Video and Album of the Year, along with Vocal Collaboration of the Year for their duet with [[Lisa Brokop]].\n\nTheir success continued in 1995 with the release of their third album, ''Ten More Miles''. The album charted 5 singles, including the Top 25 songs \"Hillbilly Country Boy\" and the title track. They racked up another 7 awards at the SCMA Awards the same year, including their fourth straight win as Entertainer of the Year, and their fifth as Group of the Year. Their television special '''One Winter's Night''' also won an SCMA Award for TV Show of the Year.\n\nThe Johner Brothers took some time off before the release of their fourth studio album, ''The Perfect Life'', in 1999. That same year, they were named Entertainer of the Decade by SCMA. As a condition of their win, that was their only honour from the SCMA for the year. They continued to rack up hits on the Canadian country singles chart, including the top 25 \"Maybe She'll Change Her Mind\", and their duet with [[Suzanne Gitzi]], \"I Don't Wanna Know.\"\n\nIn 2002, Ken decided to retire from the music business to pursue other interests. Before the duo disbanded in 2001, [[Warner Music Canada]] released The Johner Brothers' ''Greatest Hits''.<ref>[http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=151 Country Music News Canadian country Music Artists CD's CDs CD Nashville report<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The album included 16 of the Johner's biggest hits from their 11-year career, along with one new track, \"Good Ol' Days.\" Brad continues to maintain a successful solo career in Canada.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Album\n!<small>CAN Country</small>\n|-\n|1991\n|''Some Kind of Magic''\n|\n|-\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 1993\n|''My Brother and Me''\n|\n|-\n|''One Winter's Night''\n|\n|-\n|1995\n|''Ten More Miles''\n|align=\"center\"|26\n|-\n|1999\n|''The Perfect Life''\n|\n|-\n|2002\n|''Greatest Hits''\n|\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=text-align:center;\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Year\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\" | Chart Positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album\n|- \n! style=\"width:4em;font-size:90%;\"|[[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1991\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Goodbye for Good\"\n| 43\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"6\"| ''Some Kind of Magic''\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"Right on Time\"\n| 37\n|- \n| rowspan=\"4\"| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Why Did I Mistake You\"\n| \u2014\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"Old Gang\"\n| \u2014\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"Stranded in Love\"\n| \u2014\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"Where the Highway Divides\"\n| \u2014\n|- \n| rowspan=\"4\"| 1993\n! scope=\"row\"| \"My Brother and Me\"\n| 49\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"3\"| ''My Brother and Me''\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"To Keep the Country Boy Alive\"\n| 47\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"One Horse Town\"\n| 37\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"Merry Christmas from Me\"\n| \u2014\n| align=\"left\"| ''One Winter's Night''\n|- \n| rowspan=\"3\"| 1994\n! scope=\"row\"| \"If I Had Us\"\n| 46\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"4\"| ''My Brother and Me''\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"Smooth Bottom Autumn\"\n| 26\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"Light in My Life\" <small>(with [[Lisa Brokop]])</small>\n| 16\n|- \n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1995\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Starting Right Now\"\n| 18\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"Ten More Miles\"\n| 22\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"5\"| ''Ten More Miles''\n|- \n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1996\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Hillbilly Country Boy\"\n| 22\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"Feel So Bad\"\n| 78\n|- \n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1997\n! scope=\"row\"| \"First Love\"\n| 52\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"A Little Too Late\"\n| 87\n|- \n| 1998\n! scope=\"row\"| \"I Don't Wanna Know\" <small>(with [[Suzanne Gitzi]])</small>\n| 73\n| align=\"left\" rowspan=\"6\"| ''The Perfect Life''\n|- \n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1999\n! scope=\"row\"| \"The Perfect Life\"\n| 36\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"Still in Love with You\"\n| \u2014\n|- \n| rowspan=\"2\"| 2000\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Maybe She'll Change Her Mind\"\n| 24\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| \"See Jane Run\"\n| *\n|- \n| 2001\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Head Over Heels in Love\"\n| *\n|- \n| 2002\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Good Ol' Days\"\n| *\n| align=\"left\"| ''Greatest Hits''\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart<br>* denotes unknown peak positions\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The following year, he released his debut solo album, ''[[P.O. Box 423]]''. The first four singles from the project all reached the top 10 on the Canadian country chart, including \"[[Anita Got Married]],\" which became Steele's first No.&nbsp;1 song. He was nominated for the Vista Rising Star Award by the [[Canadian Country Music Association]] (CCMA) in 1996, but lost to [[Terri Clark]]. He also received a nomination for Male Vocalist of the Year. In 1997, the [[Juno Award]]s nominated Steele for Best Country Male Vocalist, and also the all-genre Best New Solo Artist. He won his first award, Vocal Event of the Year, at the 1997 CCMA Awards for his duet with [[Lisa Brokop]], \"Two Names On An Overpass.\"\n\nSteele's second album, ''[[This Is the Life (Duane Steele album)|This Is the Life]]'', was released in September 1997. The disc included a cover of [[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s \"[[If You Could Read My Mind (song)|If You Could Read My Mind]].\" The first two singles, \"Tell The Girl\" and \"If I Could Just Get To You,\" both reached the Canadian top 10. Steele was again nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year in 1998 at both the CCMA Awards and the Juno Awards. When subsequent singles failed to reach the top 30, Steele and Mercury parted ways.<ref>{{usurped|1=[https://archive.today/20120711074656/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/S/Steele_Duane/1998/10/06/749944.html CANOE \u2013 JAM!
