[[Atlantic Records]] signed the group and re-released ''Break In The Storm'' as well as the band's third album, ''Revolutions''. ''Remain'', the group's fifth album, was released independently at the end of 2002.\n\nThe Great Divide originally consisted of bassist Kelley Green, singer-songwriter [[Mike McClure]] and brothers Scott and J.J.

The band was formed in 2011 by [[Cody Canada]], the former lead vocalist and guitarist for [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] after that band broke up in 2010. The band currently consists of Canada (guitars and lead vocals), Jeremy Plato (bass guitar and vocals), and [[Eric Hansen (drummer)|Eric Hansen]] (drums).\n\n==Formation==\nAfter Oklahoma based southern rock band [[Cross Canadian Ragweed]] broke up in 2010, [[Cody Canada]] decided to start the Departed that was billed by Texas and Oklahoma music scene observers as a \"Super Group.\" Canada remained on lead vocals and lead guitar and former Ragweed bass guitar player Jeremy Plato joined Canada. Canada recruited friend and Texas based blues rock singer and songwriter Seth James to be co-lead on guitar and vocals, well known red dirt keyboardist Steve Littleton, and fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma]] native Dave Bowen on drums. Naming themselves \"The Departed\" as all had left previous bands to join together, the group at first billed themselves as \"Cody Canada and The Departed\" namely for fan recognition according to the band members in a 2011 interview.\n\n==''This Is Indian Land''==\nThe band released its first album in June 2011 titled ''This Is Indian Land'' through its own record label, Underground Sound. The record was a tribute album to Oklahoma music and songwriters. The band's cover version of the Red Dirt Rangers song \"Staring Down the Sun\" was the only released single from the album. Two other songs, \"The Ballad of Rosalie\" and \"Skyline Radio\" both charted on the Texas and Oklahoma music charts.\n\n==''Advent\u016bs''==\nOn August 24, 2012, now billed as simply The Departed, the band announced on its website and in social media that it would release its first original album, ''Advent\u016bs'' (Latin for \"arrival\") on November 13, 2012, on Underground Sound. Bowen had left the group and was replaced by Chris Doege on the drums. The band moved to an [[alternative rock]] and grunge sound with driving electric guitars and the power vocals of James and Canada. Three singles were released: \"Worth The Fight\", \"Prayer For the Lonely\" and \"Flagpole\".\n\n==''HippieLovePunk'' & Line-Up Changes==\nIn September 2013, Seth James announced that he intended to leave the band. The parting was amicable; as James said. \"After three years of great times and great music, I have decided to take a step down as a band member of the Departed. It has been an unbelievable ride and I am so grateful for the support and love along the way. My last show will be November 23 at Gruene Hall. I look forward to supporting these guys alongside you as they continue down the road.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/cody-canada-announces-the-departed-lineup-changes-new-solo-acoustic-live-album-due-this-fall/article/3883601 |title=Cody Canada announces The Departed lineup changes, new solo acoustic live album due this fall |author= Brandy McDonnell |date= September 16, 2013 |work=NewsOK }}</ref> The band continued performing as a four-piece group.\n\nIn 2014, the band finished a new album, ''HippieLovePunk''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/5-minutes-in-texas-with-cody-canada-20140721 |title=5 Minutes in Texas With Cody Canada|author= Jim Casey |date=July 21, 2014 |magazine= Rolling Stone }}</ref> It was released on January 13, 2015, and debuted at No. 9 on the Top [[Alternative Country]] Albums chart, with 4,700 copies sold in the US in its first week.

[[East Texas]] native Ross Smith replaced Littleton on keyboards and took up rhythm guitars, while [[Eric Hansen (drummer)|Eric Hansen]] became the drummer in place of Doege. In late November 2015, the band produced a music video for the song \"All Nighter\" on ''HippieLovePunk'' at John T. Floore's Country Store in [[Helotes, Texas]]. The song and the video were dedicated to the former bass guitar player for [[Micky and the Motorcars]] Mark McCoy, who had died in [[Idaho]] in 2012 while on vacation. The songs \"Inbetweener\" and \"Easy\" were released as singles.\n\n==''Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect''==\nIn early 2016, the band announced on social media that it would be releasing an album consisting of cover versions of classic country songs. This project was named ''Jeremy Plato And The Departed: In Retrospect'', honoring 1960s era country music with songs by [[Johnny Paycheck]], Stonewall Jackson and [[Charlie Walker (musician)|Charlie Walker]], among others. The bass guitarist, Plato, took the lead vocals and had Canada, Smith and Hansen as his backing on the project. [[Reckless Kelly (band)|Reckless Kelly's]] Cody Braun and Cody Angel of Jason Boland and the Stragglers contributed their instrumentation to the project, as well as the folk singer Jamie Lin Wilson, who sang backing vocals and also appeared on a popular duet with Plato.\n\n==''3''==\nIn early 2017, Ross Smith left the band and The Departed became a 3 piece set with Canada, Plato, and Hansen. On April 20, 2018 the band released the single \"Lipstick\" from their new album ''3'', that was released on June 29, 2018, by the Underground Sound Label. [[Mike McClure]], who had produced several of Cross Canadian Ragweed's albums, came back to produce the album. The name of the album comes from the number of those who were left in the band. It was also their 3rd album of original content as '''In Retrospect''', and '''Indian Land''' had both been cover albums.\n\n==Current==\nDue to the band's current lineup, several popular Cross Canadian Ragweed songs have made their way back into the Departed's nightly set list in addition to the new material the band has written. Canada said in a 2018 Rolling Stone interview that he was \"truly happy with the way the band is now and I feel this is the band I have always wanted, and really deserved.\"\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cody canada|chart=Country Albums C}}|title=Cody Canada Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cody canada|chart=Billboard 200}}|title=Cody Canada Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Billboard 200|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Independent Albums|US<br />Indie]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=cody canada|chart=Independent Albums}}|title=Cody Canada Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Independent Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=July 31, 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''This Is Indian Land''\n| \n* Release date: June 21, 2011\n* Label: Underground Sound\n| 13\n| 68\n| 11\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Advent\u016bs''\n| \n* Release date: November 13, 2012\n* Label: Underground Sound\n| 19\n| 133\n| 16\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''HippieLovePunk''\n| \n* Release date: January 13, 2015\n* Label: Underground Sound\n| 9\n| 136\n| 9\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''3''\n| \n* Release date: June 29, 2018\n* Label: Red 11 Music\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

The Brauns had previously toured with their father in Muzzie Braun & the Boys, a Western swing band, and were joined in their own group by the lead guitarist Casey Pollock, the bass guitarist Chris Schelske and the drummer Jay Nazz.\n\nWith their younger brothers Micky and Gary, Cody and Willy were raised in [[central Idaho]] near the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Mountains]], between [[Clayton, Idaho|Clayton]] and [[Challis, Idaho|Challis]] in [[Custer County, Idaho|Custer County]], and were homeschooled by their mother. Originally they were \"Muzzie Braun & the Little Braun Brothers\", as Muzzie and his brothers Gary and Billy were the \"Braun Brothers\" from [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]] in the 1970s and early 1980s, sons of the musician Eustaceus \"Mustie\" Braun.<ref name=bbhra>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eJVfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JDEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3614%2C1990319 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho)|last=McCarthy |first=John |title=Braun Brothers hit the road again for tour |date=June 22, 1990 |page=1D}}</ref><ref name=lntobitmmb81>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tJxfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tjEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5698%2C1808942 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=(obituary) |title=Mustie and Marian Braun, former Lewiston residents |date=February 20, 1981 |page=5C}}</ref> From [[North Dakota]], Mustie was a neighbor and relative of the bandleader [[Lawrence Welk]], and was a keyboard player during the last days of legalized gambling in Idaho at [[Weiser, Idaho|Weiser]] in the early 1950s.

They turned Lucy's Retired Surfers Bar, a small bar and restaurant, into a noted music venue with their Monday night residency from November 1996 to May 1998. During this period, other music venues in Austin invited them to play, including the Continental Club, the Saxon Pub, [[Stubb's Bar-B-Q|Stubb's Barbecue]], and Antone's Home of the Blues.\n\nReckless Kelly's first album, ''[[Millican (album)|Millican]]'', appeared in fall 1997 and was officially released in 1998. ''[[Acoustic: Live at Stubb's]]'' and ''[[The Day (Reckless Kelly album)|The Day]]'' followed two years later, after which David Abeyta replaced Pollock on lead guitar. ''[[Under the Table and Above the Sun|Under the Table & Above the Sun]]'' in 2003 began the band's relationship with the high-profile Sugar Hill label and won the hearts of the music press and the honky tonkin' legend [[Joe Ely]], who sang the band's praises in interviews. ''[[Wicked Twisted Road]]'' was released in 2005, and the next year the live album ''[[Reckless Kelly Was Here]]'' captured the band's stage presence. ''[[Bulletproof (Reckless Kelly album)|Bulletproof]]'' was released in summer 2008 on a new label, [[Yep Roc Records]], and includes tracks critical of and reflecting on recent sociopolitical unfoldings, such as the [[Iraq War]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In 2010, Reckless released an album of songs by one of their musical heroes, Pinto Bennett. ''[[Somewhere in Time (Reckless Kelly album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', in the band's own words, highlighted their love of \"straight-up honky tonk\". The band regularly returns to Austin to play before capacity crowds at venues like Nutty Brown Cafe & Amphitheatre.\n\nYounger brothers Micky and Gary Braun front their own band, [[Micky & The Motorcars]]. Both bands play at the annual Braun Brothers Reunion in Challis, Idaho, in August.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Millican (album)|Millican]]''\n|\n* Release date: July 7, 1998\n* Label: [[Cold Spring (label)|Cold Spring]]\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[The Day (Reckless Kelly album)|The Day]]''\n|\n* Release date: October 31, 2000\n* Label: [[Valley Entertainment]]\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Under the Table and Above the Sun|Under the Table & Above the Sun]]''\n|\n* Release date: May 13, 2003\n* Label: [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]]\n| 67\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Wicked Twisted Road]]''\n|\n* Release date: February 8, 2005\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n| 66\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Bulletproof (Reckless Kelly album)|Bulletproof]]''\n|\n* Release date: June 24, 2008\n* Label: [[Yep Roc Records]]\n| 22\n| 117\n| 2\n| 14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Somewhere in Time (Reckless Kelly album)|Somewhere in Time]]''\n|\n* Release date: February 9, 2010\n* Label: Yep Roc Records\n| 22\n| 146\n| 2\n| 15\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Good Luck & True Love''\n|\n* Release date: September 13, 2011\n* Label: No Big Deal/Red Eye\n| 20\n| 78\n| \u2014\n| 18\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Long Night Moon''\n|\n* Release date: September 3, 2013\n* Label: No Big Deal/Red Eye\n| 22\n| 106\n| \u2014\n| 22\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Sunset Motel''\n|\n* Release date: September 23, 2016\n* Label: No Big Deal/Thirty Tigers\n| 12\n| 191\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''American Jackpot / American Girls''\n|\n* Release date: May 22, 2020 (Digital)\n* Release date: July 24, 2020 (CD)\n* Label: No Big Deal/Thirty Tigers\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Live albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\" | Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Acoustic: Live at Stubb's]]''\n|\n* Release date: June 6, 2000\n* Label: Valley Entertainment\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Reckless Kelly Was Here]]''\n|\n* Release date: August 8, 2006\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n| 56\n| 41\n| 38\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Compilations ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Best of the Sugar Hill Years (Reckless Kelly album)|Best of the Sugar Hill Years]]''\n|\n* Release date: July 10, 2007\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

The band consisted of [[Cody Canada]] (lead guitar/vocals), Grady Cross (guitar), [[Randy Ragsdale]] (drums), and Jeremy Plato (bass guitar). The group released five studio albums and three live albums from 1994 until 2010. The band was at the forefront of the rise of the red dirt music scene in Oklahoma and the Texas Music scene. After almost 15 years together, the group disbanded in 2010.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nCross Canadian Ragweed started when Randy Ragsdale met Cody Canada, Matt Weidemann, and Grady Cross, who had also been playing together. The four had known each other since grade school and started playing together in Ragsdale's home seven nights a week under the tutelage of Ragsdale's father, Johnny, who had worked with musical artists in the area. After playing together, the band officially formed by combining a part of every band member's last name, coming up with the name Cross Canadian Ragweed. Matt Weidemann left the band, and Jeremy Plato joined the band, playing the bass guitar. After finishing high school, the band moved to the [[College Town]] of [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], where acts like Mike McClure's [[The Great Divide (band)|The Great Divide]] and singer-songwriter [[Jimmy LaFave]] had established enough of a local scene to earn Stillwater the nickname North Austin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/north_austin_stillwater_ok_nickname/|title=Barry Popik|website=Barrypopik.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===''Carney'' and ''Live And Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon''===\nThe group had already received significant [[college radio]] [[airplay (song)|airplay]] before it released its first album, ''Carney'' in 1998 on their own independent label. Initially, selling the band in the market it was based in, was considered by music observers to be far-fetched; however, the fan base's passion and loyalty to the band allowed them to find success in releasing that first album. Carney was well received, then the band released ''Live and Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon'' in 1999, which was also well received, especially in the local scene.\n\n===''Highway 377''===\nRagweed released its second studio album Highway 377 in 2001, though it was recorded in 1999. It propelled them into wider audience and into [[Texas]], where Canada was born and also where the band had been touring heavily. Though not a released single, the song \"Long Way Home\" was featured on several [[Dodge]] Truck Commercials in both Texas and Oklahoma which added to the popularity of the band. The band paid tribute to drummer Randy Ragsdale's father Johnny, who has passed away from cancer in 1997 with the track \"Johnny's Song.\"\n\n===''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas''===\nIn 2002 Ragweed recorded the popular live album ''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas'' in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The songs were mainly live versions of songs off ''Carney'' and ''Highway 377'', with a handful of cover songs.\n\n===''Cross Canadian Ragweed (Purple Album)''===\nIn 2002, the group then signed with [[Show Dog Nashville|Universal South]] Records and released a self-titled album also alternately known as 'The Purple Album'.  It was a tribute to the band's \"little sister\" Mandy Ragsdale, the younger sister of the band's drummer Randy Ragsdale, who had died in an auto accident near [[College Station, Texas]], and whose favorite color was purple. The album produced charted singles \"17\" and the ballad \"Constantly\", and released a music video for the hard rock track \"Don't Need You.\"\n\n===''Soul Gravy''===\nRagweed's 2004 album, ''[[Soul Gravy]]'', debuted at No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard charts. [[Lee Ann Womack]] provided background vocals on the popular single \"Sick and Tired\". The project also saw the re-release of the song \"Alabama\" (off of 2001's Highway 377) with a heavier electric sound, which appeared on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Charts]] as well.\n\n===''Garage''===\nIn October 2005 the band released ''Garage'', described by both the band and raters at [[AllMusic]] as the group's \"grungiest album ever.\" Two songs, \"Fighting' For\" and \"This Time Around\" both became hits off the album. The album charted higher than any studio album the band ever released and for the first time, the band broke into rock radio airplay across the United States due to the song \"Dimebag\", a tribute to former [[Damageplan]] and [[Pantera]] guitarist \"Dimebag\" [[Darrell Abbott]], who had been killed months earlier during a concert, in addition to a heavier rock sound overall.\n\n===''Back To Tulsa: Live And Loud At Cain's Ballroom''===\nIn late 2006, Ragweed released their third and final live album, ''Live and Loud At Cain's Ballroom'' in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The band's 24 song project was well received and featured songs from their previous projects The Purple Album, Soul Gravy, and Garage. It also featured a handful of covers as well such as [[Neil Young]]'s [[The Needle and the Damage Done]] and [[Robert Earl Keen]]'s \"Lonely Feeling.\"\n\n===''Mission California''===\nCross Canadian Ragweed recorded ''[[Mission California]]'', their fourth studio album, at the end of March 2007. The namesake of the album was due to the recording taking place in [[San Diego]], California. The band spent 25 days in the studio; the first 5 cutting 15 tracks, the next 20 polishing each. [[Lee Ann Womack]] once again laid down background vocals on 4 of the tracks to include the [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] cover \"Cry Lonely.\" ''[[Mission California]]'' was released on October 2, 2007. AllMusic reviewed the Album and found that the project was \"name appropriately, the band sounds much more a progressive West Coast sound in many of the tracks and less rural rock.\"\n\n===''Happiness and All the Other Things''===\nThe band's tenth and final album, ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was released on August 31, 2009, commemorating the band's 15th Anniversary. It featured 12 new studio tracks and three live tracks. Recorded in California, this album includes a track entitled \"51 Pieces\", which Canada penned with Micky Braun. The song was based on an incident where Ohio State police ransacked the band's bus after a stop in Cleveland at the [[House of Blues]]. It also featured \"Blue Bonnets\" which is dedicated to Cody's oldest son Dierks. ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was officially dedicated to the late Randall Locke ([[Willie Nelson]]'s long-time stage manager) who suddenly died on May 6, 2009. Other popular tracks were \"To Find My Love\", \"Burn Like The Sun\", and \"Kick In The Head.\"\n\n=== Hiatus and band break-up ===\nIn May 2010, Cross Canadian Ragweed announced a hiatus from touring.  In a band press release, Ragsdale explained, \"Right now, I need to be at home for my family, particularly my son JC, who has autism. He's 10 years old now and still struggling in his development. I feel the only way I can help him is to be more hands on and close to home.\" Despite Ragsdale wanting to \"get another drummer and press on,\" Canada stated \"We\u2019ve always said from the start, we\u2019re Ragweed as the four of us, or not Ragweed at all.\"<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cross Canadian Ragweed cancels Oklahoma City Family Jam  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701165713/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |archive-date=July 1, 2012  }}</ref> In September 2010, Canada officially announced the band was calling it quits by announcing their  \"Last Call Show\" in October 2010 at Joe's Bar in Chicago, IL, stating \"as far as that\u2019s concerned, Oct 24 is the last one, the last gig.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caller.com/news/2010/sep/16/cross-canadian-ragweed-frontmans-career-evolves/|title=Cross Canadian Ragweed frontman's career evolves|website=Caller.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Post break-up ===\nSince Cross Canadian Ragweed, Canada and Plato formed [[The Departed (band)|The Departed]] with fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma|Yukon]]-native Dave Bowen (drums), Seth James (guitar), and Steve Littleton (keyboards), releasing their debut album \"This Is Indian Land\" in June 2011.<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cody Canada & The Departed digging into red dirt roots with debut album, \"This Is Indian Land\"  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707211521/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |archive-date=July 7, 2012  }}</ref>\nRagsdale and Cross both returned to Yukon.
