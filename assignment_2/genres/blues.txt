In 1971, Raitt released her [[Bonnie Raitt (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Following this, she released a series of critically acclaimed [[Americana (music)|roots]]-influenced albums that incorporated elements of [[blues]], [[rock music|rock]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[Country music|country]]. She was also a frequent session player and collaborator with other artists, including [[Warren Zevon]], [[Little Feat]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[the Pointer Sisters]], [[John Prine]], and [[Leon Russell]].\n\nIn 1989, after several years of limited commercial success, she had a major hit with her tenth studio album,  ''[[Nick of Time (album)|Nick of Time]]'', which included the [[Nick of Time (song)|song of the same name]]. The album reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, and won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].

Her following two albums, ''[[Luck of the Draw (album)|Luck of the Draw]]'' (1991) and ''[[Longing in Their Hearts]]'' (1994), were multimillion sellers, generating several hit singles, including \"[[Something to Talk About (Bonnie Raitt song)|Something to Talk About]]\", \"[[Love Sneakin' Up On You]]\", and the ballad \"[[I Can't Make You Love Me]]\" (with [[Bruce Hornsby]] on piano).

In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on [[Warren Zevon]]'s [[Warren Zevon (album)|eponymous album]].\n\nShe was influenced by the playing style of [[Lowell George]], of the band [[Little Feat]], particularly his use of a pre-amp [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] with a [[slide guitar]].

However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Records]]. \"There was this big Columbia\u2013Warner war going on at the time\", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"[[James Taylor]] had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia... And then, Warner signed [[Paul Simon]] away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia \u2013 no matter what! So, I renegotiated my contract, and they basically matched Columbia's offer. Frankly the deal was a really big deal.\"{{sfn|Bego|1995|p=76}}\n\nWarner Brothers held higher expectations for Raitt's next album, ''[[The Glow (Bonnie Raitt album)|The Glow]]'', in 1979, but it was released to poor reviews as well as modest sales.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> Raitt had one commercial success in 1979 when she helped organize the five concerts of [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. Those shows spawned the three-record gold album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', as well as a Warner Brothers feature film [[No Nukes (film)|of the same name]], and featured co-founders [[Jackson Browne]], [[Graham Nash]], [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], and Raitt as well as [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Carly Simon]], [[James Taylor]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]], and others.\n\nIn 1980, she appeared as herself in the [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' where she sang \"Don't It Make You Wanna Dance\".\n\nFor her next record, 1982's ''[[Green Light (Bonnie Raitt album)|Green Light]]'', Raitt made a conscious attempt to revisit the sound of her earlier records. However, to her surprise, many of her peers and the media compared her new sound to the burgeoning [[New wave music|new wave]] movement. The album received her strongest reviews in years, but her sales did not improve and this had a severe impact on her relationship with Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/>\n\n====''Tongue and Groove'' and release from Warner Brothers====\nIn 1983, Raitt was finishing work on her follow-up album, ''Tongue and Groove''. The day after mastering was completed on ''Tongue & Groove'', the record company dropped Raitt from its roster, not being happy with her commercial performance up to that point.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/> The album was shelved and not released, and Raitt was left without a record contract. At this time Raitt was also struggling with alcohol and drug abuse problems.<ref name=\"notbroken\">{{cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bonnie-raitt-will-not-be-broken/ |title=Bonnie Raitt Will Not Be Broken |work=[[CBS News]] |last=Benjamin |first=Scott |date=February 18, 2009 |access-date=2012-04-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422171711/http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3445_162-1209936.html |archive-date=April 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite her personal and professional problems, Raitt continued to tour and participate in political activism. In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of \"[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]\", the anti-[[apartheid]] song written and produced by guitarist [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Along with her participation in [[Farm Aid]] and [[Amnesty International]] concerts, Raitt traveled to [[Moscow, Russia]] in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in [[Los Angeles]] for Countdown '87 to Stop [[Contras|Contra]] Aid. The benefit featured herself, along with [[Don Henley]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and others.\n\nTwo years after Warner Brothers Records dropped Raitt from their label, they notified her of their plans to release the ''Tongue and Groove'' album. \"I said it wasn't really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as ''[[Nine Lives (Bonnie Raitt album)|Nine Lives]]''.\" That album, released in 1986 to critical and commercial disappointment, was Raitt's last new recording for Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/>\n\nIn late 1987, Raitt joined singers [[k.d. lang]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] as background vocalists for [[Roy Orbison]]'s television special, ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]''. Following this highly acclaimed broadcast, Raitt began working on new material. By then, she was clean and sober, having resolved her problems with substance abuse.

During this time, Raitt considered signing with the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]-owned [[Paisley Park|Paisley Park Records]], but they could not come to an agreement and negotiations fell through. Instead, she began recording a bluesy mix of pop and rock songs under the production guidance of [[Don Was]] at [[Capitol Records]].<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/>\n\nRaitt had met Was through [[Hal Willner]], who was putting together ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films|Stay Awake]]'', a tribute album to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] music for [[A&M Records|A&M]]. Was and Willner both wanted Raitt to sing lead on an adult-contemporary arrangement created by Was for \"[[Baby Mine (song)|Baby Mine]]\", the lullaby from ''[[Dumbo]]''.

He was one of the main figures of the [[outlaw country]] subgenre that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the [[Nashville sound]]. The critical success of his album ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' (1975) and ''[[Stardust (Willie Nelson album)|Stardust]]'' (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of [[biofuel]]s and the [[Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|legalization of marijuana]].\n\nNelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended [[Baylor University]] for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. He worked as a [[disc jockey]] at radio stations in his native Texas, and at several radio stations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], all the while working as a singer and songwriter throughout the late 1950s. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\", \"[[Hello Walls]]\", \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\", and \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\". In 1960 he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price's]] band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]''. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with [[RCA Victor]] and joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson grew weary of the corporate Nashville music scene, and in 1972 he moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return to performing, appearing frequently at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]].\n\nIn 1973, after signing with [[Atlantic Records]], Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as ''Shotgun Willie'' and ''Phases and Stages''. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album ''Red Headed Stranger''. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', along with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jessi Colter]], and [[Tompall Glaser]]. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (album)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'' and recording hit songs like \"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]\", \"[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]\", and \"[[Pancho and Lefty]]\", he joined the country [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], along with fellow singers [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. In 1985, he helped organize the first [[Farm Aid]] concert to benefit American farmers; the concerts have been held annually ever since and Nelson has been a fixture, appearing at every one.\n\nIn 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which claimed that he owed $32{{nbsp}}million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]''; the profits of the double album\u2014destined to the IRS\u2014and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.\n\nNelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'', followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the [[biodiesel]] brand [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]], whose product is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 120\n   | footer    = Nelson as a junior at [[Abbott High School]] (top, pictured in 1949).

Butts died in 2017.{{sfn|Krauser, Emily|2023}}\n\nNelson owns \"Luck, Texas\", a ranch in [[Spicewood, Texas|Spicewood]],{{sfn|Rolling Stone staff|2017}}{{sfn|Parker|2014}} and also lives in Maui, Hawaii{{sfn|Kane|2008}} with several celebrity neighbors.{{sfn|Grigoriadis|p=57|2007}} While swimming in Hawaii in 1981, Nelson's [[Pneumothorax|lung collapsed]]. He was taken to the Maui Memorial Hospital and his scheduled concerts were canceled.{{sfn|Krebs|1981}} Nelson temporarily stopped smoking cigarettes each time his lungs became congested, and resumed when the congestion ended.{{sfn|O'Hare|2010}} He was then smoking between two and three packs per day. After suffering from pneumonia several times, he decided to quit either marijuana or tobacco. He chose to quit tobacco.{{sfn|NPR staff|2012}} In 2008, he started to smoke marijuana with a carbon-free system to avoid the effects of smoke.{{sfn|Patoski|2011}} In 2004, Nelson underwent surgery for [[carpal tunnel syndrome]], as he had damaged his wrists by continuously playing the guitar.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2002}} On the recommendation of his doctor, he canceled his scheduled concerts and only wrote songs during his recovery.{{sfn|Miller Loncaric|2008}} In 2012, he canceled a fund-raising appearance in the Denver area. He suffered from breathing problems due to high altitude and emphysema and was taken to a local hospital. His publicist Elaine Schock confirmed soon after that Nelson's health was good and that he was heading to his next scheduled concert in Dallas, Texas.{{sfn|McKinnley|2012}} After repeated instances of pneumonia and emphysema through the years, Nelson underwent [[stem-cell therapy]] in 2015 to improve the state of his lungs.{{sfn|Heim|2015}}\n\nDuring his childhood, Nelson grew interested in martial arts. He ordered self-defense manuals on [[jujitsu]] and judo that he saw advertised in ''[[Batman]]'' and ''[[Superman]]'' comic books. Nelson started to formally practice [[kung fu]] after he moved to Nashville, in the 1960s.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=55}} During the 1980s, Nelson began training in [[tae kwon do|taekwondo]] and now holds a second-degree black belt in that discipline.{{sfn|Chilton|2012}} During the 1990s, Nelson started to practice the Korean martial art [[GongKwon Yusul]].{{sfn|Hall|2014}} In 2014, after 20 years in the discipline, his Grand Master Sam Um presented him with a fifth-degree black belt in a ceremony held in Austin, Texas.{{sfn|Chilton|2014}} A 2014 ''[[Tae Kwon Do Times]]'' magazine interview revealed that Nelson had developed an unorthodox manner of training during the lengthy periods of time he was on tour. Nelson would conduct his martial arts training on his tour bus \"The Honeysuckle Rose\" and send videos to his supervising Master for review and critique.{{sfn|Zirogiannis|2014}}\n\nIn March 2021, \"I'll Be Seeing You\", a new original by Nelson, was used on a [[public service announcement]] by the [[Ad Council]] to encourage [[COVID-19 vaccination in the United States]].{{sfn|Weisholtz, Drew|2021}} Earlier in January 2021, Nelson and his sister received the [[Moderna COVID-19 vaccine]].{{sfn|Doyle, Patrick|2021}} In May 2022, Nelson postponed several shows after he contracted [[COVID-19]]. Nelson's wife detailed that he was severely affected by the illness, and that he received a treatment including [[Paxlovid]], [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]], and steroids. Nelson resumed his tour in September 2022.{{sfn|Goldstein, Tiffany|2022}} During June 2024, Nelson had to cancel his performances at Outlaw Music Festival due to health complications and was ordered to rest for four days by a doctor.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Morrow |first=Brendan |title=Willie Nelson cancels Outlaw Music Festival performances for health reasons |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2024/06/23/willie-nelson-illness-outlaw-music-festival/74185542007/ |access-date=June 23, 2024 |newspaper=USA Today}}</ref>\n\n===Legal issues===\nNelson has been arrested several times for marijuana possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in [[Dallas]], Texas.{{sfn|Goddard|2010}} In 1977, after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to [[The Bahamas]]. Nelson and Cochran arrived late to the airport and boarded the flight without luggage.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=247}} The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=248}} Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=249}}\n\nIn 1994, [[Texas Highway Patrol|Texas Highway patrolmen]] found marijuana in his car near Waco, Texas. His requirement to appear in court prevented his attending the Grammy awards that year.{{sfn|Patoski|2011}} While traveling to [[Ann W. Richards]]' funeral in 2006, Nelson, along with his manager and his sister, Bobbie, were arrested in [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana]], and charged with possession of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms.{{sfn|People staff|2006}} Nelson received six months probation.{{sfn|Patoski|p=471|2008}}\n\nOn November 26, 2010, Nelson was arrested in [[Sierra Blanca, Texas]], for possession of six ounces of marijuana found in his tour bus while traveling from Los Angeles back to Texas. He was released after paying bail of $2,500.{{sfn|Cline|2010}} Prosecutor Kit Bramblett supported not sentencing Nelson to jail due to the small amount of marijuana involved, but suggested instead a $100 fine and told Nelson that he would have him sing \"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\" for the court. Judge Becky Dean-Walker said that Nelson would have to pay the fine but not to perform the song, explaining that the prosecutor was joking.{{sfn|Caulfield|2011}} Nelson's lawyer Joe Turner reached an agreement with the prosecutor. Nelson was set to pay a $500 fine to avoid a two-year jail sentence with a 30-day review period, which in case of another incident would end the agreement.{{sfn|Amter|2011}} The judge later rejected the agreement, claiming that Nelson was receiving preferential treatment for his celebrity status; the offense normally carried a one-year jail sentence.{{sfn|TMZ staff|2011}} Bramblett declared that the case would remain open until it was either dismissed or the judge changed her opinion.{{sfn|Cohen|2012}}\n\n===Issues with the Internal Revenue Service===\nIn 1990, the IRS seized most of Nelson's assets, claiming that he owed $32&nbsp;million. In addition to the unpaid taxes, Nelson's situation was worsened by the weak investments he had made during the early 1980s.{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=177}} In 1978, after he fired his manager Neil Reshen, Nelson was introduced by Dallas lawyer Terry Bray to the accounting firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|Price Waterhouse]]. To repay the debt Reshen had created with the IRS, Nelson was recommended to invest in tax shelters that ultimately flopped.{{sfn|Patoski|p=407|2008}} While the IRS disallowed his deductions for 1980, 1981 and 1982 (at a time that Nelson's income multiplied),{{sfn|Patoski|p=407|2008}} due to penalties and interests, the debt increased by the end of the decade.{{sfn|Patoski|p=406|2008}}\n\nHis lawyer, [[Jay Goldberg]], negotiated the sum to be lowered to $16&nbsp;million. Later, Nelson's attorney renegotiated a settlement with the IRS in which he paid $6&nbsp;million, although Nelson did not comply with the agreement.{{sfn|Draper|1991|p=177}} Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]'' as a double album, with all profits destined for the IRS. Many of his assets were auctioned and purchased by friends, who donated or rented his possessions to him for a nominal fee. He sued Price Waterhouse, contending that they put his money in illegal tax shelters.{{sfn|Cowan|1991}} The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount and Nelson cleared his debts by 1993.{{sfn|Johnston|1995}}\n\n==Legacy==\n{{See also|List of awards and nominations received by Willie Nelson}}\n[[Image:Willie Nelson BLVD.jpg|thumb|Willie Nelson boulevard in Austin, Texas|alt=A sign of a street that reads \"2nd street, Willie Nelson BLVD 100\".

Nelson was named honorary chairman of the advisory board of the project.{{sfn|Texas Music Project staff|2011}} In 2005, Democratic Texas Senator [[Gonzalo Barrientos]] introduced a bill to name {{convert|49|mi|km}} of the [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] section of [[Texas State Highway 130|State Highway 130]] after Nelson, and at one point 23 of the 31 state senators were co-sponsors of the bill.{{sfn|Ward|2005}} The legislation was dropped after two Republican senators, [[Florence Shapiro]] and Wentworth, objected, citing Nelson's lack of connection to the highway, his fund raisers for Democrats, his drinking, and his marijuana advocacy.{{sfn|Fort Worth Star-telegram staff|2005}}\n\nAn important collection of Willie Nelson materials (1975\u20131994) became part of the [[Wittliff collections]] of Southwestern Writers, [[Texas State University]], [[San Marcos, Texas]]. The collection contains lyrics, screenplays, letters, concert programs, tour itineraries, posters, articles, clippings, personal effects, promotional items, souvenirs, and documents. It documents Nelson's IRS troubles and how Farm Aid contributions were used. Most of the material was collected by Nelson's friend [[Bill Wittliff]], who wrote or co-wrote ''Honeysuckle Rose'', ''Barbarosa'' and ''Red Headed Stranger''.{{sfn|Alkek Library staff|2010}} In 2014, Nelson donated his personal collection to the [[Dolph Briscoe Center for American History]]. The items include photographs, correspondence, song manuscripts, posters, certificate records, awards, signed books, screenplays, personal items and gifts and tributes from Nelson's fans.{{sfn|Briscoe Center staff|2014}}\n\nIn April 2010, Nelson received the \"Feed the Peace\" award from [[The Nobelity Project]] for his extensive work with Farm Aid and overall contributions to world peace. On June 23, 2010, he was inducted into the Library of Congress's [[National Recording Registry]].{{sfn|Donahue|2010}} Nelson is an honorary trustee of the [[Dayton International Peace Museum]].{{sfn|Dayton Peace Museum staff|2010}}\nIn 2010, Austin, Texas renamed Second Street to Willie Nelson Boulevard. The city also unveiled [[Willie Nelson statue|a life-size statue]] to honor him, placed at the entrance of ''Austin City Limits''' new studio.{{sfn|BBC News staff|2010}} The non-profit organization Capital Area Statues commissioned sculptor Clete Shields to execute the project.{{sfn|Houston Chronicle staff|2010}} The statue was unveiled on April 20, 2012.{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012a}} The date selected by the city of Austin unintentionally coincided with the number 4/20, [[420 (cannabis culture)|associated with cannabis culture]]. In spite of the coincidence and Nelson's advocacy for the legalization of marijuana, the ceremony was scheduled also for 4:20&nbsp;pm. During the ceremony, Nelson performed the song \"[[Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die]]\".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012b}} The same year, Nelson was honored during the 46th Annual Country Music Association Awards as the first recipient of the [[Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]], which was also named after him.{{sfn|Lewis|2012}} In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Berklee College of Music]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2013}} The following year, he was part of the inaugural class inducted into the ''Austin City Limits'' Hall of Fame. Also included among the first inductees was his friend Darrell Royal, whose jamming parties that Nelson participated in were the source of inspiration for the show.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2014}}\n\nFor many years, Nelson's image was marked by his red hair, often divided into two long braids partially concealed under a bandanna. In the April 2007 issue of [[Stuff Magazine]] Nelson was interviewed about his long locks.{{sfn|Everett|2010}} \"I started braiding my hair when it started getting too long, and that was, I don't know, probably in the 70's.\" On May 26, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair,{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2010}} and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published a photograph of the pigtail-free Nelson on his website. Nelson wanted a more maintainable hairstyle, as well helping him stay cool more easily at his Maui home.{{sfn|Carter|2010}} In October 2014, the braids of Nelson were sold for $37,000 at an auction of the Waylon Jennings estate. In 1983, Nelson cut his braids and gave them to Jennings as a gift during a party celebrating Jennings' sobriety.{{sfn|New York Post staff|2014}}\n\nNelson's touring and recording group, the Family, is full of longstanding members. The original lineup included his sister Bobbie Nelson, drummer Paul English, harmonicist [[Mickey Raphael]], bassist Bee Spears, drummer/percussionist Billy English (Paul's younger brother), and guitarist [[Jody Payne]].{{sfn|Scobey|1982|pp=198, 358}} The current lineup only includes Nelson himself, Raphael, and Billy English from the classic lineup, as Jody Payne retired (before dying in 2013), Bee Spears died in 2011, Paul English died in 2020, and Willie's sister [[Bobbie Nelson]] died in 2022.{{sfn|Kerns|2012}} ''Willie & Family'' tours North America in the bio-diesel bus ''Honeysuckle Rose'', which is fueled by Bio-Willie.{{sfn|Vancouver Province staff|2007}} Nelson's tour buses were customized by Florida Coach since 1979. The company built the ''Honeysuckle Rose I'' in 1983, which was replaced after a collision in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, in 1990. The interior was salvaged and reused for the second version of the bus the same year. Nelson changed his tour bus in 1996, 2005 and 2013, currently touring on the ''Honeysuckle Rose V''.{{sfn|Langer|2014}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Further|Willie Nelson albums discography|Willie Nelson singles discography|List of songs written by Willie Nelson}}\n;Solo studio albums\n<!--This section is just for solo studio albums.

Active since 1990, he has recorded eight studio albums, and has charted more than twenty singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. His highest-charting hits are \"[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]\" (1992), \"[[Tender Moment]]\" (1993), and \"[[A Little Bit of You (Lee Roy Parnell song)|A Little Bit of You]]\" (1995), all of which peaked at No.&nbsp;2. Four more of his singles have charted in the Top Ten as well. Parnell made a shift in the early 2000s back to the bluesier sounds of his early works, releasing two blues albums on [[Vanguard Records]] and [[Universal South]]. Besides his own work, Parnell has played [[slide guitar]] and [[National String Instrument Corporation|National guitar]] on several other country and blues recordings.\n\n==Early years==\nParnell was born in [[Abilene, Texas]], but raised in [[Stephenville, Texas]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Landon|first2=Grelun|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&q=%22lee+roy+parnell%22&pg=PA359|date=July 14, 2000|publisher=Macmillan|pages=359\u2013360|isbn=9780312264871}}</ref> His father had performed with [[Bob Wills]], and Parnell gave his first performance at age six on Wills' radio show.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Parnell played guitar and drums in various bands during his teenage years. He joined [[Kinky Friedman]]'s [[Texas Jewboys]] in his late teens and moved to Austin in 1974 to join the city's budding music scene. <ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1987, and he signed with the [[Arista Nashville]] recording company two years later.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===''Lee Roy Parnell''===\nParnell released his [[Lee Roy Parnell (album)|self-titled debut album]] for [[Arista Records]] in 1990.<ref name=\"Rusty Russell 2009\">Rusty Russell.  \"Lee Roy Parnell: A Nashville hitmaker breaks out. \" Guitar Player  December 1, 2001: General Interest Module, ProQuest. Web.  July 14, 2009.</ref> This album produced three chart singles in \"Crocodile Tears\", \"Oughta Be a Law\" and \"Family Tree\", none of which charted in the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. A video for \"Mexican Money\" was created and released, but the song was not released to radio.\n\n===''Love Without Mercy''===\n''[[Love Without Mercy]]'' was Parnell's breakthrough album, released in 1992. Although its lead-off single \"The Rock\" fell short of Top 40, the next three singles all reached Top Ten:<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \"[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]\" at No.&nbsp;2, the title track at No.&nbsp;8, and finally \"Tender Moment\" also at No.&nbsp;2. These three were also Top Ten hits on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' charts in Canada.\n\n===''On the Road''===\n1993's ''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'', Parnell's third album for the Arista label, also produced two top-10 hits: the [[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell song)|title track]] and \"I'm Holding My Own\", at No.&nbsp;6 and No.&nbsp;3 respectively. The album also contained a No.&nbsp;17-peaking rendition of the [[Hank Williams]] song \"Take These Chains from My Heart\", which Parnell recorded as a duet with [[Ronnie Dunn]] of [[Brooks & Dunn]], although Dunn was not credited on the chart. The final single from ''On the Road'', \"The Power of Love\", peaked at No.&nbsp;51.\n\n===''We All Get Lucky Sometimes''===\nParnell's fourth album, 1995's ''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'', was also his first for Career Records, then a newly formed subsidiary of [[Arista Nashville]]. This album's lead-off single \"A Little Bit of You\" was the third single of his career to reach No.&nbsp;2. Following it were the No.&nbsp;12 \"When a Woman Loves a Man\" (featuring background vocals by [[Trisha Yearwood]]), the No.&nbsp;3 \"Heart's Desire\" and another No.&nbsp;12 in \"Giving Water to a Drowning Man\". The album's title track, which was its fifth single, peaked at No.&nbsp;46.\n\n===''Every Night's a Saturday Night'' and ''Hits and Highways Ahead''===\n''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' was Parnell's final release for Career Records. This was his first album since his debut release that did not produce a Top Ten hit, and only three singles were released from it: \"Lucky Me, Lucky You\" at No.&nbsp;35, \"You Can't Get There From Here\" at No.&nbsp;39 (his final Top 40 hit), and \"All That Matters Anymore\" at No.&nbsp;50. After Career Records was merged back into Arista Nashville, Parnell released his final album for the Arista label, 1999's ''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]''. This album's only single, \"She Won't Be Lonely Long\", peaked at No.&nbsp;57, and by the year's end, Parnell exited Arista's roster.\n\n===''Tell the Truth'', ''Back to the Well'' and ''Midnight Believer''===\nIn 2000 Parnell signed to [[Vanguard Records]]<ref name=\"Rusty Russell 2009\"/> and released the album ''Tell the Truth''. This album's only single, \"South by Southwest\", failed to chart, and he soon left the label as well. Parnell's next album, ''Back to the Well'', came in 2006 on [[Universal South Records]], although it also produced only one non-charting single in \"Daddies and Daughters.\"\n\n==External contributions==\nBesides playing [[slide guitar]] and [[National guitar]] on his albums and co-writing several of his own songs, Parnell has co-written two Top 40 country hits for other artists: \"Too Much\" by [[Pirates of the Mississippi]] and \"[[That's My Story (song)|That's My Story]]\" by [[Collin Raye]], from 1992 and 1993 respectively. In 1994, he and [[Steve Wariner]] collaborated with [[Diamond Rio]] on a cover of [[Merle Haggard]]'s \"[[Workin' Man's Blues]]\", credited to Jed Zeppelin and recorded for a tribute album ''[[Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard]]''. This rendition peaked at No.&nbsp;48 on the country charts. He played slide guitar on [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]'s late-1994 Number One hit \"[[Shut Up and Kiss Me (Mary Chapin Carpenter song)|Shut Up and Kiss Me]]\", and appeared in the song's music video. Parnell added slide guitar to [[Delbert McClinton]]'s \"Sending Me Angels\" in 1997, and in late 2004, he was credited with playing slide guitar on [[David Lee Murphy]]'s No.&nbsp;46-peaking single \"Inspiration\", from the album ''[[Tryin' to Get There]]''.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Lee Roy Parnell discography}}\n\n;Studio albums\n*''[[Lee Roy Parnell (album)|Lee Roy Parnell]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Love Without Mercy]]'' (1992)\n*''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'' (1993)\n*''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' (1997)\n*''Tell the Truth'' (2001)\n*''Back to the Well'' (2006)\n*''Midnight Believer'' (2017)\n\n;Compilation albums\n*''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]'' (1999)\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*A{{anchor|endnote_A}}'''[[#ref_A|^]]''' Jed Zeppelin was an all-star group featuring [[Diamond Rio]], Lee Roy Parnell, and [[Steve Wariner]].\n\n{{refend}}\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Organization\n!Award\n!Nominee/Work\n!Result\n|-\n|1994\n|rowspan=2| [[Country Music Association Awards]]\n|[[Country Music Association Award for New Artist of the Year|Horizon Award]]\n|Lee Roy Parnell\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1995\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"[[Workin' Man Blues]]\" <small>with [[Diamond Rio]] and [[Steve Wariner]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1996\n|[[Grammy Awards]]\n|[[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]]\n|\"Cat Walk\" <small>with [[Flaco Jimenez]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1997\n|Country Music Association Awards\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"John the Revelator: Peace in the Valley\" <small>with [[The Fairfield Four]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1998\n|Grammy Awards\n|Best Country Instrumental Performance\n|\"Mama, Screw Your Wig On Tight\"\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- *Cronin, Peter. \"Parnell slips into the mainstream.\" ''Billboard'' 105.46 (Nov 13, 1993): 35.\n*Flippo, Chet. \"Parnell Revisits Hits and Looks `Ahead'; Remembering Music Pioneer Anita Carter.\" ''Billboard'' 111.33 (Aug 14, 1999): 28. \n*Huey, Steve.

She filmed a music video in her hometown with the help of her community, and the music video is now being used in schools across Canada, as a teaching tool of this rising issue. This album was nominated for \"Aboriginal Album of the year\", and Shawanda was invited to perform at the Juno Awards opening Gala.\n\nIn 2016, Shawanda released her 4th album \"Fish out of water\", feeling torn between her future and her past, the album had a mix of Blues and country music songs, which ended up having am Americana sound.

Later that year Crystal signed a record deal with True North Records, who rereleased the album later that year, and they achieved moderate airplay at Blues Radio in America.\n\nIn 2020, Shawanda released \"Church House Blues\",which had extensive airplay at Blues Radio in America, and in Europe.

He was known for performing in [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. Allman grew up with an interest in [[rhythm and blues]] music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with rock music, [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] at times. He wrote several of the band's most popular songs, including \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", \"[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]\", and \"[[Midnight Rider]]\". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven studio albums. He was born and spent much of his childhood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], before relocating to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] and then [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\nHe and his brother [[Duane Allman]] formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 live album ''[[At Fillmore East]]'', but shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, and released  ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', which became their most successful album, in 1973. Allman began a solo career with ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' the same year. He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star [[Cher]]. He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song \"[[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|I'm No Angel]]\" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, ''[[Low Country Blues]]'' (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance use, which formed the basis of his memoir ''[[My Cross to Bear]]'' (2012). His final album, ''[[Southern Blood (album)|Southern Blood]]'', was released posthumously on September 8, 2017.\n\nAllman performed with a [[Hammond organ]] and guitar, and was recognized for his soulful voice. For his work in music, Allman was referred to as a [[Southern rock]] pioneer<ref>Sources:\n* {{Cite news |last=Lewis |first=Andy |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-cross-bear-318317 |title=My Cross to Bear |date=April 30, 2012 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=May 27, 2024}}\n* {{Cite news |last=Morris |first=Chris |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/people-news/gregg-allman-dies-dead-69-southern-rock-1202446640/ |title=Gregg Allman, Southern Rock Pioneer, Dies at 69 |date=May 27, 2024 |work=Variety |access-date=May 27, 2017}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last=Gehr |first=Richard |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/gregg-allman-southern-rock-legend-dead-at-69-w433068 |title=Gregg Allman, Southern Rock Pioneer, Dead at 69 |date=May 27, 2017 |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=May 27, 2017}}</ref> and received numerous awards, including one [[Grammy Award]]; he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Georgia Music Hall of Fame]].

They met a man named [[Floyd Miles]], and they began to jam with his band, the Houserockers. \"I would just sit there and study Floyd ... I studied how he phrased his songs, how he got the words out, and how the other guys sang along with him\", Gregg would later recall.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=46}} They later formed their first \"real\" band, the Escorts, which performed a mix of [[top 40]] and R&B music at clubs around town.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=49}} Duane, who took the lead vocal role on early demos, encouraged his younger brother to sing instead.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=21}} He and Duane often spent all of their money on records, as they attempted to learn songs from them. The group performed constantly as music became their entire focus; Gregg missed his high school graduation because he was performing that evening.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=50}} In his autobiography, Gregg recalls listening to Nashville R&B station [[WLAC]] at night and discovering artists such as [[Muddy Waters]], who later became central to his musical evolution.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=63}} He avoided being drafted into the [[Vietnam War]] by intentionally shooting himself in the foot.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=61}}\n\nThe Escorts evolved into [[the Allman Joys]], the brothers' first successful band.

It contained more original songs by Allman, though they still felt constricted by its process. The band broke up when Duane explicitly told off executives at Liberty. They threatened to [[Non-compete clause|freeze the band]], so they would be unable to record for any other label for seven years.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=96}} Allman stayed behind to appease the label, giving them the rights to a solo album.

In 1991, she signed to [[BNA Records]] (then known as BNA Entertainment), releasing her self-titled debut album that year. This album produced two singles for her on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Stewart is a BMI Award winning songwriter and has  appeared in films alongside Oscar winners Gwynneth Paltrow and Melissa Leo. She currently tours with her jazz combo.\n\n==Life and career==\nStewart was born August 6, 1968, in [[Louisville, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"miss\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/musicians/lisa-stewart.html |title=Lisa Stewart, Mississippi country singer |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |last=Glass |first=Paul |work=Mississippi Writers and Musicians}}</ref> She first sang in public at age six in her church. Five years later, she attended a Tent Show at the Nashville Fan Fair, where she gave her first country performance. By 1987, Stewart had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she won the Roy Acuff scholarship at Belmont University and found work as a studio singer.\n\nWhile performing at a wedding reception in 1991, Stewart was noticed by Mark Thompson, [[Wynonna Judd]]'s bandleader, who asked Stewart to sing demos for him. After recording the demos, Stewart signed to a recording contract with BNA Entertainment (now known as [[BNA Records]]), releasing her debut single \"Somebody's in Love\" in late 1992. This song was the first of three singles from her self-titled debut album \u2014 which was released in January 1993 \u2014 followed by \"Under the Light of the Texaco\" and \"Drive Time\". Also included on the album was a cover of [[Jeannie Seely]]'s 1966 single \"Don't Touch Me\".\n\nIn addition to promoting her album on radio tours, Stewart hosted the nationally syndicated entertainment news show ''#1 Country''. She also made appearances on [[The Nashville Network]], hosting their programs ''Yesteryear'' and ''This Week in Country Music'' and was a featured performer on \"Music City Tonight\". \n\nIn 1994, she recorded her second album for BNA. Produced by [[Barry Beckett]], the album was entitled <i>Solitary Heart</i>, and the first single was set to be \"[[Let's Go to Vegas]]\" (later a Top 5 hit for [[Faith Hill]]), but after a shakeup at the label, Stewart was dropped and the album was shelved. \n\nFrom 1997-1999, she co-hosted <i>This Week in Country Music</i> with Steve Phillips on TNN. She also continued to tour throughout the late 1990s.\n\nStewart began acting in the 21st century under her married name of Lisa Stewart Seals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/lisa-stewart-seals-movie/ |title=Lisa Stewart Seals Scores Role in Tim McGraw Movie |website=Theboot.com |date= 8 February 2010|accessdate=2020-04-04}}</ref> but is currently known as Lisa Stewart.\n\nShe is now making a mark in the jazz world and performs with her combo, often featuring Chester Thompson on drums (Genesis, Weather Report, Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention).\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Lisa Stewart (album)|Lisa Stewart]]''\n| \n* Release date: January 1993\n* Label: [[BNA Records]]\n* Format: CD, [[audio cassette|cassette]]\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Somebody's in Love\"\n| 61\n| \u2014\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1993\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Under the Light of the Texaco\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1993/BB-1993-06-19.pdf|title=Single Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=June 19, 1993}}</ref>\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Drive Time\"\n| 72\n| 60\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

Between 1997 and 1999, Thomas Wade & Wayward received seven CCMA awards, winning best group or duo three times, and both independent single and song awards for '97 and '98. The group was also nominated for three [[Juno Award]]s for [[Juno Award for Country Recording of the Year|Best Country Group or Duo]] in 1997, 1998 and 1999.

Five singles were released from the album, including the top 10 \"Running Away with You\". Following the release of a career retrospective in 2001, ''So Far'', Wade was diagnosed with [[oromandibular dystonia]].<ref name=\"cmn\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=1168 |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 15, 2008 |archive-date=April 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430043546/http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=1168 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While he was forced to end his recording career, he has continued his career as a songwriter.

Largely co-written with Canadian songwriter Tim Taylor, this record is a return to Wade's musical roots, the music of the fifties, [[classic country]] and [[blues]] as well as a musical reunion with bassist John Dymond, keyboardist Steve O'Connor and drummer Gary Craig. As of 2016, Wade has been touring again as a headlining act.

In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on [[Warren Zevon]]'s [[Warren Zevon (album)|eponymous album]].\n\nShe was influenced by the playing style of [[Lowell George]], of the band [[Little Feat]], particularly his use of a pre-amp [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] with a [[slide guitar]].

However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Records]]. \"There was this big Columbia\u2013Warner war going on at the time\", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"[[James Taylor]] had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia... And then, Warner signed [[Paul Simon]] away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia \u2013 no matter what!

However, to her surprise, many of her peers and the media compared her new sound to the burgeoning [[New wave music|new wave]] movement.

In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of \"[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]\", the anti-[[apartheid]] song written and produced by guitarist [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Along with her participation in [[Farm Aid]] and [[Amnesty International]] concerts, Raitt traveled to [[Moscow, Russia]] in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in [[Los Angeles]] for Countdown '87 to Stop [[Contras|Contra]] Aid. The benefit featured herself, along with [[Don Henley]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and others.\n\nTwo years after Warner Brothers Records dropped Raitt from their label, they notified her of their plans to release the ''Tongue and Groove'' album. \"I said it wasn't really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as ''[[Nine Lives (Bonnie Raitt album)|Nine Lives]]''.\" That album, released in 1986 to critical and commercial disappointment, was Raitt's last new recording for Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/>\n\nIn late 1987, Raitt joined singers [[k.d. lang]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] as background vocalists for [[Roy Orbison]]'s television special, ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]''.

He was one of the main figures of the [[outlaw country]] subgenre that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the [[Nashville sound]]. The critical success of his album ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' (1975) and ''[[Stardust (Willie Nelson album)|Stardust]]'' (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of [[biofuel]]s and the [[Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|legalization of marijuana]].\n\nNelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended [[Baylor University]] for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. He worked as a [[disc jockey]] at radio stations in his native Texas, and at several radio stations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], all the while working as a singer and songwriter throughout the late 1950s. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\", \"[[Hello Walls]]\", \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\", and \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\". In 1960 he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price's]] band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]''. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with [[RCA Victor]] and joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson grew weary of the corporate Nashville music scene, and in 1972 he moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return to performing, appearing frequently at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]].\n\nIn 1973, after signing with [[Atlantic Records]], Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as ''Shotgun Willie'' and ''Phases and Stages''. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album ''Red Headed Stranger''. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', along with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jessi Colter]], and [[Tompall Glaser]]. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (album)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'' and recording hit songs like \"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]\", \"[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]\", and \"[[Pancho and Lefty]]\", he joined the country [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], along with fellow singers [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. In 1985, he helped organize the first [[Farm Aid]] concert to benefit American farmers; the concerts have been held annually ever since and Nelson has been a fixture, appearing at every one.\n\nIn 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which claimed that he owed $32{{nbsp}}million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]''; the profits of the double album\u2014destined to the IRS\u2014and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.\n\nNelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'', followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the [[biodiesel]] brand [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]], whose product is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 120\n   | footer    = Nelson as a junior at [[Abbott High School]] (top, pictured in 1949).

Meanwhile, Nelson had a short stint as a relief phone operator in Abbott, followed by a job as a [[tree care|tree trimmer]] for the local electric company, as well as a [[pawn shop]] employee.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} After leaving school in 1950, he joined the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]; he served for nine months before being medically discharged because of issues with his back.{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=392}} Upon his return in 1952, he married Martha Matthews, and from 1954 to 1956 studied agriculture at [[Baylor University]], where he joined the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity, until dropping out to pursue a career in music.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=24}} He worked as a nightclub bouncer, autohouse partsman, saddle maker, and tree trimmer again. He later joined [[Johnny Bush]]'s band.\n\nNelson moved with his family to [[Pleasanton, Texas]], where he auditioned for a job as a DJ at [[KWMF|KBOP]]. The owner of the station, Dr. Ben Parker, gave Nelson the job despite his lack of experience working on radio.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} With the equipment of the station, Nelson made his first two recordings in 1955: \"[[The Storm Has Just Begun]]\" and \"When I've Sung My Last Hillbilly Song\". He recorded the tracks on used tapes, and sent the demos to the local label SARG Records, which rejected them.{{sfn|Thomson|p=24|2012}} He then had stints working for KDNT in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], [[KAMM (AM)|KCUL]], and [[KFJZ|KCNC]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], where he hosted ''[[The Western Express]]'', taught Sunday school, and played in nightclubs. He then decided to move to [[San Diego]] but, when he was unable to find a job there, he hitchhiked to [[Portland, Oregon]], where his mother lived.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} When nobody picked him up, he ended up sleeping in a ditch{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=92}} before hopping a [[Rail freight transport|freight train]] bound for [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. A truck driver drove him to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=93}}\n\n==Music career==\n===Beginnings (1956\u20131971)===\nNelson was hired by [[KVAN (AM)|KVAN]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]], and appeared frequently on a television show.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}}{{sfn|Patoski|pp=74\u201376|2008|}} He made his first record in 1956, \"[[No Place for Me]]\", that included [[Leon Payne]]'s \"Lumberjack\" on the B-side.{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=70}} The recording failed.{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|page=246}} 246]}} Nelson continued working as a radio announcer and singing in Vancouver clubs.{{sfn|Erlewine|1997|p=324}}\nHe made several appearances in a Colorado nightclub, later moving to [[Springfield, Missouri]]. After failing to land a spot on the ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', he started to work as a dishwasher. Unhappy with his job, he moved back to Texas. After a short time in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], he settled in Fort Worth, and quit the music business for a year.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} He sold bibles and vacuum cleaners door-to-door,{{sfn|Dingus|1992|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZysEAAAAMBAJ|77|page=77}} 77]}} and eventually became a sales manager for the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=5}}\n\nAfter his son Billy was born in 1958, the family moved to [[Houston]], Texas. On the way, Nelson stopped by the [[Esquire Ballroom]] to sell his original songs to house band singer [[Larry Butler (producer)|Larry Butler]]. Butler refused to purchase the song \"[[Mr. Record Man]]\" for $10, instead giving Nelson a $50 loan to rent an apartment and a six-night job singing in the club.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=116, 117}} Nelson rented the apartment near Houston in [[Pasadena, Texas]], where he also worked at the radio station as the sign-on disc jockey. During this time, he recorded two singles for [[Pappy Daily]] on [[D Records]]{{sfn|Smith|2013}} \"[[Man With the Blues]]\"/\"The Storm Has Just Begun\" and \"[[What a Way to Live (song)|What a Way to Live]]\"/\"Misery Mansion\".{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=117}} Nelson then was hired by guitar instructor Paul Buskirk to work as an instructor in his school.

He recorded the song for his debut album ''...&nbsp;And Then I Wrote''.}}\n\nNelson moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1960, but was unable to find a label to sign him. During this period he often spent time at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]], a bar near the Grand Ole Opry frequented by the show's stars and other singers and songwriters.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=36}} There Nelson met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter who worked for the publishing company Pamper Music, owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Cochran heard Nelson during a jam session with [[Buddy Emmons]] and Jimmy Day. Cochran had just earned a raise of $50 a week, but convinced Smith to pay Nelson the money instead to sign him to Pamper Music. On hearing Nelson sing \"Hello Walls\" at Tootsie's, [[Faron Young]] decided to record it.{{sfn|Kosser|2006|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=DL6gHNXWToQC|page=73}} 73]}} After Ray Price recorded Nelson's \"Night Life\", and his previous bassist [[Johnny Paycheck]] quit, Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the [[Cherokee Cowboys]], his songs became hits for other artists, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\" ([[Billy Walker (singer)|Billy Walker]]), \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" ([[Roy Orbison]]), and, most famously, \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\" by [[Patsy Cline]].{{sfn|Erlewine|1997|p=324}} Nelson and Cochran also met Cline's husband, [[Charlie Dick]] at Tootsie's. Dick liked a song of Nelson's he heard on the bar's jukebox. Nelson played him a demo tape of \"Crazy\". Later that night Dick played the tape for Cline, who decided to record it.{{sfn|Patoski|2008|p=6}} \"Crazy\" became the biggest [[jukebox]] hit of all time.{{sfn|NPR staff|1996}}\n\n[[File:Willie Nelson Grand Ole Opry publicity - cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|Nelson performing on a [[Grand Ole Opry]] package show in 1965]]\nNelson signed with [[Liberty Records]] and was recording by August 1961 at the [[Bradley Studios]] in Nashville. His first two successful singles as an artist were released by the next year, including \"[[Willingly]]\" (a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, [[Shirley Collie Nelson|Shirley Collie]], which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at No.&nbsp;10) and \"[[Touch Me (Willie Nelson song)|Touch Me]]\" (his second Top Ten, stalling at No.&nbsp;7).{{sfn|Edwards|Callahan|2001}} Nelson's tenure at Liberty yielded his first album entitled ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]'', released in September 1962.{{sfn|Bush|Mitchell|2007|p=79}} In 1963 Collie and Nelson were married in [[Las Vegas]].

During the ceremony, Nelson performed the song \"[[Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die]]\".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012b}} The same year, Nelson was honored during the 46th Annual Country Music Association Awards as the first recipient of the [[Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]], which was also named after him.{{sfn|Lewis|2012}} In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Berklee College of Music]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2013}} The following year, he was part of the inaugural class inducted into the ''Austin City Limits'' Hall of Fame. Also included among the first inductees was his friend Darrell Royal, whose jamming parties that Nelson participated in were the source of inspiration for the show.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2014}}\n\nFor many years, Nelson's image was marked by his red hair, often divided into two long braids partially concealed under a bandanna. In the April 2007 issue of [[Stuff Magazine]] Nelson was interviewed about his long locks.{{sfn|Everett|2010}} \"I started braiding my hair when it started getting too long, and that was, I don't know, probably in the 70's.\" On May 26, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair,{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2010}} and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published a photograph of the pigtail-free Nelson on his website. Nelson wanted a more maintainable hairstyle, as well helping him stay cool more easily at his Maui home.{{sfn|Carter|2010}} In October 2014, the braids of Nelson were sold for $37,000 at an auction of the Waylon Jennings estate. In 1983, Nelson cut his braids and gave them to Jennings as a gift during a party celebrating Jennings' sobriety.{{sfn|New York Post staff|2014}}\n\nNelson's touring and recording group, the Family, is full of longstanding members. The original lineup included his sister Bobbie Nelson, drummer Paul English, harmonicist [[Mickey Raphael]], bassist Bee Spears, drummer/percussionist Billy English (Paul's younger brother), and guitarist [[Jody Payne]].{{sfn|Scobey|1982|pp=198, 358}} The current lineup only includes Nelson himself, Raphael, and Billy English from the classic lineup, as Jody Payne retired (before dying in 2013), Bee Spears died in 2011, Paul English died in 2020, and Willie's sister [[Bobbie Nelson]] died in 2022.{{sfn|Kerns|2012}} ''Willie & Family'' tours North America in the bio-diesel bus ''Honeysuckle Rose'', which is fueled by Bio-Willie.{{sfn|Vancouver Province staff|2007}} Nelson's tour buses were customized by Florida Coach since 1979. The company built the ''Honeysuckle Rose I'' in 1983, which was replaced after a collision in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, in 1990. The interior was salvaged and reused for the second version of the bus the same year. Nelson changed his tour bus in 1996, 2005 and 2013, currently touring on the ''Honeysuckle Rose V''.{{sfn|Langer|2014}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Further|Willie Nelson albums discography|Willie Nelson singles discography|List of songs written by Willie Nelson}}\n;Solo studio albums\n<!--This section is just for solo studio albums.

His highest-charting hits are \"[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]\" (1992), \"[[Tender Moment]]\" (1993), and \"[[A Little Bit of You (Lee Roy Parnell song)|A Little Bit of You]]\" (1995), all of which peaked at No.&nbsp;2.

Besides his own work, Parnell has played [[slide guitar]] and [[National String Instrument Corporation|National guitar]] on several other country and blues recordings.\n\n==Early years==\nParnell was born in [[Abilene, Texas]], but raised in [[Stephenville, Texas]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Landon|first2=Grelun|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&q=%22lee+roy+parnell%22&pg=PA359|date=July 14, 2000|publisher=Macmillan|pages=359\u2013360|isbn=9780312264871}}</ref> His father had performed with [[Bob Wills]], and Parnell gave his first performance at age six on Wills' radio show.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Parnell played guitar and drums in various bands during his teenage years.

Although its lead-off single \"The Rock\" fell short of Top 40, the next three singles all reached Top Ten:<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \"[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]\" at No.&nbsp;2, the title track at No.&nbsp;8, and finally \"Tender Moment\" also at No.&nbsp;2. These three were also Top Ten hits on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' charts in Canada.\n\n===''On the Road''===\n1993's ''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'', Parnell's third album for the Arista label, also produced two top-10 hits: the [[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell song)|title track]] and \"I'm Holding My Own\", at No.&nbsp;6 and No.&nbsp;3 respectively. The album also contained a No.&nbsp;17-peaking rendition of the [[Hank Williams]] song \"Take These Chains from My Heart\", which Parnell recorded as a duet with [[Ronnie Dunn]] of [[Brooks & Dunn]], although Dunn was not credited on the chart. The final single from ''On the Road'', \"The Power of Love\", peaked at No.&nbsp;51.\n\n===''We All Get Lucky Sometimes''===\nParnell's fourth album, 1995's ''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'', was also his first for Career Records, then a newly formed subsidiary of [[Arista Nashville]]. This album's lead-off single \"A Little Bit of You\" was the third single of his career to reach No.&nbsp;2. Following it were the No.&nbsp;12 \"When a Woman Loves a Man\" (featuring background vocals by [[Trisha Yearwood]]), the No.&nbsp;3 \"Heart's Desire\" and another No.&nbsp;12 in \"Giving Water to a Drowning Man\". The album's title track, which was its fifth single, peaked at No.&nbsp;46.\n\n===''Every Night's a Saturday Night'' and ''Hits and Highways Ahead''===\n''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' was Parnell's final release for Career Records. This was his first album since his debut release that did not produce a Top Ten hit, and only three singles were released from it: \"Lucky Me, Lucky You\" at No.&nbsp;35, \"You Can't Get There From Here\" at No.&nbsp;39 (his final Top 40 hit), and \"All That Matters Anymore\" at No.&nbsp;50. After Career Records was merged back into Arista Nashville, Parnell released his final album for the Arista label, 1999's ''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]''. This album's only single, \"She Won't Be Lonely Long\", peaked at No.&nbsp;57, and by the year's end, Parnell exited Arista's roster.\n\n===''Tell the Truth'', ''Back to the Well'' and ''Midnight Believer''===\nIn 2000 Parnell signed to [[Vanguard Records]]<ref name=\"Rusty Russell 2009\"/> and released the album ''Tell the Truth''. This album's only single, \"South by Southwest\", failed to chart, and he soon left the label as well. Parnell's next album, ''Back to the Well'', came in 2006 on [[Universal South Records]], although it also produced only one non-charting single in \"Daddies and Daughters.\"\n\n==External contributions==\nBesides playing [[slide guitar]] and [[National guitar]] on his albums and co-writing several of his own songs, Parnell has co-written two Top 40 country hits for other artists: \"Too Much\" by [[Pirates of the Mississippi]] and \"[[That's My Story (song)|That's My Story]]\" by [[Collin Raye]], from 1992 and 1993 respectively. In 1994, he and [[Steve Wariner]] collaborated with [[Diamond Rio]] on a cover of [[Merle Haggard]]'s \"[[Workin' Man's Blues]]\", credited to Jed Zeppelin and recorded for a tribute album ''[[Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard]]''. This rendition peaked at No.&nbsp;48 on the country charts. He played slide guitar on [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]'s late-1994 Number One hit \"[[Shut Up and Kiss Me (Mary Chapin Carpenter song)|Shut Up and Kiss Me]]\", and appeared in the song's music video. Parnell added slide guitar to [[Delbert McClinton]]'s \"Sending Me Angels\" in 1997, and in late 2004, he was credited with playing slide guitar on [[David Lee Murphy]]'s No.&nbsp;46-peaking single \"Inspiration\", from the album ''[[Tryin' to Get There]]''.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Lee Roy Parnell discography}}\n\n;Studio albums\n*''[[Lee Roy Parnell (album)|Lee Roy Parnell]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Love Without Mercy]]'' (1992)\n*''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'' (1993)\n*''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' (1997)\n*''Tell the Truth'' (2001)\n*''Back to the Well'' (2006)\n*''Midnight Believer'' (2017)\n\n;Compilation albums\n*''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]'' (1999)\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*A{{anchor|endnote_A}}'''[[#ref_A|^]]''' Jed Zeppelin was an all-star group featuring [[Diamond Rio]], Lee Roy Parnell, and [[Steve Wariner]].\n\n{{refend}}\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Organization\n!Award\n!Nominee/Work\n!Result\n|-\n|1994\n|rowspan=2| [[Country Music Association Awards]]\n|[[Country Music Association Award for New Artist of the Year|Horizon Award]]\n|Lee Roy Parnell\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1995\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"[[Workin' Man Blues]]\" <small>with [[Diamond Rio]] and [[Steve Wariner]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1996\n|[[Grammy Awards]]\n|[[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]]\n|\"Cat Walk\" <small>with [[Flaco Jimenez]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1997\n|Country Music Association Awards\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"John the Revelator: Peace in the Valley\" <small>with [[The Fairfield Four]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1998\n|Grammy Awards\n|Best Country Instrumental Performance\n|\"Mama, Screw Your Wig On Tight\"\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- *Cronin, Peter. \"Parnell slips into the mainstream.\" ''Billboard'' 105.46 (Nov 13, 1993): 35.\n*Flippo, Chet. \"Parnell Revisits Hits and Looks `Ahead'; Remembering Music Pioneer Anita Carter.\" ''Billboard'' 111.33 (Aug 14, 1999): 28. \n*Huey, Steve.

She signed a publishing deal with Island Bound Music in 2014,and then signed a production deal with Scott Hendricks in 2015, and signed with RCA records in 2016.\n\nMany of Shawanda's songs have been inspired by her connections to Wiikwemkoong and part of her 2016 album was recorded at the Debajehmujig Creation Centre in [[Assiginack|Manitowaning, Manitoulin Island]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.manitoulin.ca/2016/04/27/crystal-shawanda-talks-two-new-albums-set-release-summer/|title=Crystal Shawanda talks about her two new albums set to release this summer|last=Burridge|first=Robin|date=2016-04-27|work=Manitoulin Expositor|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315070442/http://www.manitoulin.ca/2016/04/27/crystal-shawanda-talks-two-new-albums-set-release-summer/|archive-date=2018-03-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\nShawanda's first album, ''[[Dawn of a New Day (Crystal Shawanda album)|Dawn of a New Day]]'', was released in Canada on June 24, 2008, and in the United States on August 19. The album entered the Canadian Country Albums chart at number 2, and the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart at number 16. It became the highest charted album by a full-blooded Canadian First Nations country artist in the SoundScan era.<ref>[http://www.sonybmgnashville.com/pressreleases/details.cfm?artistid=1000010&pressid=1000520]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nShawanda toured with various artists across Canada and the northern United States in 2008. In 2009, she toured Canada and the United States with [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Dierks Bentley]] as a special guest on the Paisley Party 2009 tour. Her first single, \"You Can Let Go\", peaked at number 21 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. In mid-2009, Shawanda left RCA Nashville and, through her own record label, New Sun Records, and a distribution deal with EMI released a Christmas album titled ''I'll Be Home for Christmas''.\n\nIn 2010, Shawanda released a single, \"Beautiful Day\", via her own label, New Sun Records. Shawanda also performed at the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in 2010, performing \"Let's Come Together\" and \"This Is My Land\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nashville.com/music/2010/11/crystal-shawanda-to-perform-at-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/ |title=Crystal Shawanda to Perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade \u00ab Nashville.com |accessdate=2014-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222192231/http://www.nashville.com/music/2010/11/crystal-shawanda-to-perform-at-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/ |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}</ref> She then released another single, \"Love Enough\", on August 15, 2011, in both Canada and the United States, and in promotion she went on to tour with Reba. Shawanda's second studio album, ''[[Just Like You (Crystal Shawanda album)|Just Like You]]'', was released by New Sun on April 24, 2012, and won a Juno award for Aboriginal Album of the year in 2013. She became the first full blood Indigenous woman as the CEO of a record label, to procure these milestones.\n\nIn 2014, Shawanda made a departure from country music and released a Blues album titled \"The Whole World's got the Blues\",she focused on rather than regurgitating someone else's blues, she told her story as an Indigenous woman in \"Pray Sister Pray\", which raised awareness of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous women issue, across Canada. She filmed a music video in her hometown with the help of her community, and the music video is now being used in schools across Canada, as a teaching tool of this rising issue. This album was nominated for \"Aboriginal Album of the year\", and Shawanda was invited to perform at the Juno Awards opening Gala.\n\nIn 2016, Shawanda released her 4th album \"Fish out of water\", feeling torn between her future and her past, the album had a mix of Blues and country music songs, which ended up having am Americana sound. Perhaps best said by DMME.net \"She's a force of nature, Crystal Shawanda, the Canadian singer may reside in Nashville, but her casting as a country artist, whitewashed as the genre demands, is hopefully over\".\n\nIn 2017, Shawanda released \"Voo Doo Woman\", consisting of 6 covers of blues standards, and 4 originals. Later that year Crystal signed a record deal with True North Records, who rereleased the album later that year, and they achieved moderate airplay at Blues Radio in America.\n\nIn 2020, Shawanda released \"Church House Blues\",which had extensive airplay at Blues Radio in America, and in Europe. She also went on to become the first Indigenous woman to win a Juno award for \"Blues album of the year\".\n\nIn 2022 Crystal released \"Midnight Blues\", which debuted at #8 on the American Billboard blues chart, and she became the first full blood Indigenous person to appear on this chart. She also received extensive airplay at Blues radio. This album was also nominated for \"blues album of the year\" at the Juno awards.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/crystal-shawanda/chart-history/clp/|title=Crystal Shawanda- Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/crystal-shawanda/chart-history/tlp/|title=Crystal Shawanda - Billboard 200|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Dawn of a New Day (Crystal Shawanda album)|Dawn of a New Day]]''\n| \n* Release date: June 24, 2008\n* Label: [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]]\n| 16\n| 81\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''I'll Be Home for Christmas''\n| \n* Release date: December 1, 2009\n* Label: New Sun/EMI/On Ramp Records\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Just Like You (Crystal Shawanda album)|Just Like You]]''\n| \n* Release date: April 24, 2012\n* Label: New Sun Records/[[Fontana North]]\n| _\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''The Whole World's Got the Blues''\n| \n* Release date: September 30, 2014\n* Label: New Sun Records\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Fish Out of Water''\n|\n* Release date: October 2016\n* Label: New Sun Records\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Voodoo Woman''\n|\n* Release date: October 31, 2017\n* Label: New Sun Records/Fontana North\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Church House Blues''\n|\n* Release date: April 17, 2020\n* Label: True North Records\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n|Midnight Blues                               \n|Release date: 2022\nLabel: True North Records\n|8\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\" |\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n;Notes\n{{refbegin}}\n*a<span id=\"endnote_a\" ></span>'''[[#ref_a|^]]''' \"You Can Let Go\" also reached number nine on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] chart.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|page=376|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref>\n{{refend}}\n\n====As a featured artist====\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Single\n!

He was known for performing in [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. Allman grew up with an interest in [[rhythm and blues]] music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with rock music, [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] at times. He wrote several of the band's most popular songs, including \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", \"[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]\", and \"[[Midnight Rider]]\". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven studio albums. He was born and spent much of his childhood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], before relocating to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] and then [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\nHe and his brother [[Duane Allman]] formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 live album ''[[At Fillmore East]]'', but shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, and released  ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', which became their most successful album, in 1973. Allman began a solo career with ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' the same year. He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star [[Cher]]. He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song \"[[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|I'm No Angel]]\" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, ''[[Low Country Blues]]'' (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance use, which formed the basis of his memoir ''[[My Cross to Bear]]'' (2012).

In 1991, she signed to [[BNA Records]] (then known as BNA Entertainment), releasing her self-titled debut album that year. This album produced two singles for her on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Stewart is a BMI Award winning songwriter and has  appeared in films alongside Oscar winners Gwynneth Paltrow and Melissa Leo. She currently tours with her jazz combo.\n\n==Life and career==\nStewart was born August 6, 1968, in [[Louisville, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"miss\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/musicians/lisa-stewart.html |title=Lisa Stewart, Mississippi country singer |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |last=Glass |first=Paul |work=Mississippi Writers and Musicians}}</ref> She first sang in public at age six in her church. Five years later, she attended a Tent Show at the Nashville Fan Fair, where she gave her first country performance. By 1987, Stewart had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she won the Roy Acuff scholarship at Belmont University and found work as a studio singer.\n\nWhile performing at a wedding reception in 1991, Stewart was noticed by Mark Thompson, [[Wynonna Judd]]'s bandleader, who asked Stewart to sing demos for him. After recording the demos, Stewart signed to a recording contract with BNA Entertainment (now known as [[BNA Records]]), releasing her debut single \"Somebody's in Love\" in late 1992. This song was the first of three singles from her self-titled debut album \u2014 which was released in January 1993 \u2014 followed by \"Under the Light of the Texaco\" and \"Drive Time\". Also included on the album was a cover of [[Jeannie Seely]]'s 1966 single \"Don't Touch Me\".\n\nIn addition to promoting her album on radio tours, Stewart hosted the nationally syndicated entertainment news show ''#1 Country''. She also made appearances on [[The Nashville Network]], hosting their programs ''Yesteryear'' and ''This Week in Country Music'' and was a featured performer on \"Music City Tonight\". \n\nIn 1994, she recorded her second album for BNA. Produced by [[Barry Beckett]], the album was entitled <i>Solitary Heart</i>, and the first single was set to be \"[[Let's Go to Vegas]]\" (later a Top 5 hit for [[Faith Hill]]), but after a shakeup at the label, Stewart was dropped and the album was shelved. \n\nFrom 1997-1999, she co-hosted <i>This Week in Country Music</i> with Steve Phillips on TNN. She also continued to tour throughout the late 1990s.\n\nStewart began acting in the 21st century under her married name of Lisa Stewart Seals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/lisa-stewart-seals-movie/ |title=Lisa Stewart Seals Scores Role in Tim McGraw Movie |website=Theboot.com |date= 8 February 2010|accessdate=2020-04-04}}</ref> but is currently known as Lisa Stewart.\n\nShe is now making a mark in the jazz world and performs with her combo, often featuring Chester Thompson on drums (Genesis, Weather Report, Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention).\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Lisa Stewart (album)|Lisa Stewart]]''\n| \n* Release date: January 1993\n* Label: [[BNA Records]]\n* Format: CD, [[audio cassette|cassette]]\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Somebody's in Love\"\n| 61\n| \u2014\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1993\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Under the Light of the Texaco\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1993/BB-1993-06-19.pdf|title=Single Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=June 19, 1993}}</ref>\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Drive Time\"\n| 72\n| 60\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

Between 1997 and 1999, Thomas Wade & Wayward received seven CCMA awards, winning best group or duo three times, and both independent single and song awards for '97 and '98. The group was also nominated for three [[Juno Award]]s for [[Juno Award for Country Recording of the Year|Best Country Group or Duo]] in 1997, 1998 and 1999.

Five singles were released from the album, including the top 10 \"Running Away with You\". Following the release of a career retrospective in 2001, ''So Far'', Wade was diagnosed with [[oromandibular dystonia]].<ref name=\"cmn\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=1168 |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 15, 2008 |archive-date=April 30, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200430043546/http://www.countrymusicnews.ca/news.ihtml?step=2&article_id=1168 |url-status=dead }}</ref> While he was forced to end his recording career, he has continued his career as a songwriter.

Largely co-written with Canadian songwriter Tim Taylor, this record is a return to Wade's musical roots, the music of the fifties, [[classic country]] and [[blues]] as well as a musical reunion with bassist John Dymond, keyboardist Steve O'Connor and drummer Gary Craig. As of 2016, Wade has been touring again as a headlining act.

In 1976, Raitt made an appearance on [[Warren Zevon]]'s [[Warren Zevon (album)|eponymous album]].\n\nShe was influenced by the playing style of [[Lowell George]], of the band [[Little Feat]], particularly his use of a pre-amp [[Dynamic range compression|compressor]] with a [[slide guitar]].

However, the song's commercial success prompted a bidding war for Raitt between [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Columbia Records]]. \"There was this big Columbia\u2013Warner war going on at the time\", recalled Raitt in a 1990 interview. \"[[James Taylor]] had just left Warner Bros. and made a big album for Columbia... And then, Warner signed [[Paul Simon]] away from Columbia, and they didn't want me to have a hit record for Columbia \u2013 no matter what!

However, to her surprise, many of her peers and the media compared her new sound to the burgeoning [[New wave music|new wave]] movement.

In 1985, she sang and appeared in the video of \"[[Sun City (song)|Sun City]]\", the anti-[[apartheid]] song written and produced by guitarist [[Steven Van Zandt]]. Along with her participation in [[Farm Aid]] and [[Amnesty International]] concerts, Raitt traveled to [[Moscow, Russia]] in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in [[Los Angeles]] for Countdown '87 to Stop [[Contras|Contra]] Aid. The benefit featured herself, along with [[Don Henley]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and others.\n\nTwo years after Warner Brothers Records dropped Raitt from their label, they notified her of their plans to release the ''Tongue and Groove'' album. \"I said it wasn't really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad. I mean, I was out there touring on my savings to keep my name up, and my ability to draw was less and less. So they agreed to let me go in and recut half of it, and that's when it came out as ''[[Nine Lives (Bonnie Raitt album)|Nine Lives]]''.\" That album, released in 1986 to critical and commercial disappointment, was Raitt's last new recording for Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"LarkinBlues\"/>\n\nIn late 1987, Raitt joined singers [[k.d. lang]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] as background vocalists for [[Roy Orbison]]'s television special, ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night]]''.

He was one of the main figures of the [[outlaw country]] subgenre that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the [[Nashville sound]]. The critical success of his album ''[[Shotgun Willie]]'' (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of ''[[Red Headed Stranger]]'' (1975) and ''[[Stardust (Willie Nelson album)|Stardust]]'' (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of [[biofuel]]s and the [[Legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States|legalization of marijuana]].\n\nNelson wrote his first song at age seven and joined his first band at ten. During high school, he toured locally with the Bohemian Polka as their lead singer and guitar player. After graduating from high school in 1950, he joined the [[U.S. Air Force]] but was later discharged due to back problems. After his return, Nelson attended [[Baylor University]] for two years but dropped out because he was succeeding in music. He worked as a [[disc jockey]] at radio stations in his native Texas, and at several radio stations in the [[Pacific Northwest]], all the while working as a singer and songwriter throughout the late 1950s. During that time, he wrote songs that would become country standards, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\", \"[[Hello Walls]]\", \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\", and \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\". In 1960 he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and later signed a publishing contract with Pamper Music which allowed him to join [[Ray Price (musician)|Ray Price's]] band as a bassist. In 1962, he recorded his first album, ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]''. Due to this success, Nelson signed in 1964 with [[RCA Victor]] and joined the [[Grand Ole Opry]] the following year. After mid-chart hits in the late 1960s and the early 1970s, Nelson grew weary of the corporate Nashville music scene, and in 1972 he moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. The ongoing music scene of Austin motivated Nelson to return to performing, appearing frequently at the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]].\n\nIn 1973, after signing with [[Atlantic Records]], Nelson turned to outlaw country, including albums such as ''Shotgun Willie'' and ''Phases and Stages''. In 1975, he switched to Columbia Records, where he recorded the critically acclaimed album ''Red Headed Stranger''. The same year, he recorded another outlaw country album, ''[[Wanted! The Outlaws]]'', along with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Jessi Colter]], and [[Tompall Glaser]]. During the mid-1980s, while creating hit albums like ''[[Honeysuckle Rose (album)|Honeysuckle Rose]]'' and recording hit songs like \"[[On the Road Again (Willie Nelson song)|On the Road Again]]\", \"[[To All the Girls I've Loved Before]]\", and \"[[Pancho and Lefty]]\", he joined the country [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]], along with fellow singers [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. In 1985, he helped organize the first [[Farm Aid]] concert to benefit American farmers; the concerts have been held annually ever since and Nelson has been a fixture, appearing at every one.\n\nIn 1990, Nelson's assets were seized by the [[Internal Revenue Service]], which claimed that he owed $32{{nbsp}}million. The difficulty of paying his outstanding debt was aggravated by weak investments he had made during the 1980s. In 1992, Nelson released ''[[The IRS Tapes: Who'll Buy My Memories?]]''; the profits of the double album\u2014destined to the IRS\u2014and the auction of Nelson's assets cleared his debt. During the 1990s and 2000s, Nelson continued touring extensively and released albums every year. Reviews ranged from positive to mixed. He explored genres such as reggae, blues, jazz, and folk.\n\nNelson made his first movie appearance in the 1979 film ''[[The Electric Horseman]]'', followed by other appearances in movies and on television. Nelson is a major [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] activist and the co-chair of the advisory board of the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML), which is in favor of marijuana legalization. On the environmental front, Nelson owns the [[biodiesel]] brand [[Willie Nelson Biodiesel]], whose product is made from vegetable oil. Nelson is also the honorary chairman of the advisory board of the Texas Music Project, the official music charity of the state of Texas.\n\n==Early life==\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 120\n   | footer    = Nelson as a junior at [[Abbott High School]] (top, pictured in 1949).

Meanwhile, Nelson had a short stint as a relief phone operator in Abbott, followed by a job as a [[tree care|tree trimmer]] for the local electric company, as well as a [[pawn shop]] employee.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} After leaving school in 1950, he joined the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]; he served for nine months before being medically discharged because of issues with his back.{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=392}} Upon his return in 1952, he married Martha Matthews, and from 1954 to 1956 studied agriculture at [[Baylor University]], where he joined the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity, until dropping out to pursue a career in music.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=24}} He worked as a nightclub bouncer, autohouse partsman, saddle maker, and tree trimmer again. He later joined [[Johnny Bush]]'s band.\n\nNelson moved with his family to [[Pleasanton, Texas]], where he auditioned for a job as a DJ at [[KWMF|KBOP]]. The owner of the station, Dr. Ben Parker, gave Nelson the job despite his lack of experience working on radio.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} With the equipment of the station, Nelson made his first two recordings in 1955: \"[[The Storm Has Just Begun]]\" and \"When I've Sung My Last Hillbilly Song\". He recorded the tracks on used tapes, and sent the demos to the local label SARG Records, which rejected them.{{sfn|Thomson|p=24|2012}} He then had stints working for KDNT in [[Denton, Texas|Denton]], [[KAMM (AM)|KCUL]], and [[KFJZ|KCNC]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], where he hosted ''[[The Western Express]]'', taught Sunday school, and played in nightclubs. He then decided to move to [[San Diego]] but, when he was unable to find a job there, he hitchhiked to [[Portland, Oregon]], where his mother lived.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} When nobody picked him up, he ended up sleeping in a ditch{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=92}} before hopping a [[Rail freight transport|freight train]] bound for [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. A truck driver drove him to a bus station and loaned him $10 for a ticket to reach [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].{{sfn|Nelson|Ritz|2015|p=93}}\n\n==Music career==\n===Beginnings (1956\u20131971)===\nNelson was hired by [[KVAN (AM)|KVAN]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]], and appeared frequently on a television show.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}}{{sfn|Patoski|pp=74\u201376|2008|}} He made his first record in 1956, \"[[No Place for Me]]\", that included [[Leon Payne]]'s \"Lumberjack\" on the B-side.{{sfn|Evans|2006|p=70}} The recording failed.{{sfn|Dicair|2007|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=MYMQl9dsKJEC|page=246}} 246]}} Nelson continued working as a radio announcer and singing in Vancouver clubs.{{sfn|Erlewine|1997|p=324}}\nHe made several appearances in a Colorado nightclub, later moving to [[Springfield, Missouri]]. After failing to land a spot on the ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', he started to work as a dishwasher. Unhappy with his job, he moved back to Texas. After a short time in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], he settled in Fort Worth, and quit the music business for a year.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=4}} He sold bibles and vacuum cleaners door-to-door,{{sfn|Dingus|1992|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=ZysEAAAAMBAJ|77|page=77}} 77]}} and eventually became a sales manager for the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''.{{sfn|Myers|1969|p=5}}\n\nAfter his son Billy was born in 1958, the family moved to [[Houston]], Texas. On the way, Nelson stopped by the [[Esquire Ballroom]] to sell his original songs to house band singer [[Larry Butler (producer)|Larry Butler]]. Butler refused to purchase the song \"[[Mr. Record Man]]\" for $10, instead giving Nelson a $50 loan to rent an apartment and a six-night job singing in the club.{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=116, 117}} Nelson rented the apartment near Houston in [[Pasadena, Texas]], where he also worked at the radio station as the sign-on disc jockey. During this time, he recorded two singles for [[Pappy Daily]] on [[D Records]]{{sfn|Smith|2013}} \"[[Man With the Blues]]\"/\"The Storm Has Just Begun\" and \"[[What a Way to Live (song)|What a Way to Live]]\"/\"Misery Mansion\".{{sfn|Nelson|Shrake|Shrake|2000|p=117}} Nelson then was hired by guitar instructor Paul Buskirk to work as an instructor in his school.

He recorded the song for his debut album ''...&nbsp;And Then I Wrote''.}}\n\nNelson moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1960, but was unable to find a label to sign him. During this period he often spent time at [[Tootsie's Orchid Lounge]], a bar near the Grand Ole Opry frequented by the show's stars and other singers and songwriters.{{sfn|Richmond|2000|p=36}} There Nelson met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter who worked for the publishing company Pamper Music, owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Cochran heard Nelson during a jam session with [[Buddy Emmons]] and Jimmy Day. Cochran had just earned a raise of $50 a week, but convinced Smith to pay Nelson the money instead to sign him to Pamper Music. On hearing Nelson sing \"Hello Walls\" at Tootsie's, [[Faron Young]] decided to record it.{{sfn|Kosser|2006|p=[{{google books|plainurl=y|id=DL6gHNXWToQC|page=73}} 73]}} After Ray Price recorded Nelson's \"Night Life\", and his previous bassist [[Johnny Paycheck]] quit, Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the [[Cherokee Cowboys]], his songs became hits for other artists, including \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\" ([[Billy Walker (singer)|Billy Walker]]), \"[[Pretty Paper (song)|Pretty Paper]]\" ([[Roy Orbison]]), and, most famously, \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\" by [[Patsy Cline]].{{sfn|Erlewine|1997|p=324}} Nelson and Cochran also met Cline's husband, [[Charlie Dick]] at Tootsie's. Dick liked a song of Nelson's he heard on the bar's jukebox. Nelson played him a demo tape of \"Crazy\". Later that night Dick played the tape for Cline, who decided to record it.{{sfn|Patoski|2008|p=6}} \"Crazy\" became the biggest [[jukebox]] hit of all time.{{sfn|NPR staff|1996}}\n\n[[File:Willie Nelson Grand Ole Opry publicity - cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|Nelson performing on a [[Grand Ole Opry]] package show in 1965]]\nNelson signed with [[Liberty Records]] and was recording by August 1961 at the [[Bradley Studios]] in Nashville. His first two successful singles as an artist were released by the next year, including \"[[Willingly]]\" (a duet with his soon-to-be second wife, [[Shirley Collie Nelson|Shirley Collie]], which became his first charting single and first Top Ten at No.&nbsp;10) and \"[[Touch Me (Willie Nelson song)|Touch Me]]\" (his second Top Ten, stalling at No.&nbsp;7).{{sfn|Edwards|Callahan|2001}} Nelson's tenure at Liberty yielded his first album entitled ''[[...And Then I Wrote]]'', released in September 1962.{{sfn|Bush|Mitchell|2007|p=79}} In 1963 Collie and Nelson were married in [[Las Vegas]].

During the ceremony, Nelson performed the song \"[[Roll Me Up and Smoke Me When I Die]]\".{{sfn|Tomlinson|2012b}} The same year, Nelson was honored during the 46th Annual Country Music Association Awards as the first recipient of the [[Willie Nelson Lifetime Achievement Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]], which was also named after him.{{sfn|Lewis|2012}} In 2013, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Berklee College of Music]].{{sfn|Sullivan|2013}} The following year, he was part of the inaugural class inducted into the ''Austin City Limits'' Hall of Fame. Also included among the first inductees was his friend Darrell Royal, whose jamming parties that Nelson participated in were the source of inspiration for the show.{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2014}}\n\nFor many years, Nelson's image was marked by his red hair, often divided into two long braids partially concealed under a bandanna. In the April 2007 issue of [[Stuff Magazine]] Nelson was interviewed about his long locks.{{sfn|Everett|2010}} \"I started braiding my hair when it started getting too long, and that was, I don't know, probably in the 70's.\" On May 26, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Nelson had cut his hair,{{sfn|Associated Press staff|2010}} and Nashville music journalist Jimmy Carter published a photograph of the pigtail-free Nelson on his website. Nelson wanted a more maintainable hairstyle, as well helping him stay cool more easily at his Maui home.{{sfn|Carter|2010}} In October 2014, the braids of Nelson were sold for $37,000 at an auction of the Waylon Jennings estate. In 1983, Nelson cut his braids and gave them to Jennings as a gift during a party celebrating Jennings' sobriety.{{sfn|New York Post staff|2014}}\n\nNelson's touring and recording group, the Family, is full of longstanding members. The original lineup included his sister Bobbie Nelson, drummer Paul English, harmonicist [[Mickey Raphael]], bassist Bee Spears, drummer/percussionist Billy English (Paul's younger brother), and guitarist [[Jody Payne]].{{sfn|Scobey|1982|pp=198, 358}} The current lineup only includes Nelson himself, Raphael, and Billy English from the classic lineup, as Jody Payne retired (before dying in 2013), Bee Spears died in 2011, Paul English died in 2020, and Willie's sister [[Bobbie Nelson]] died in 2022.{{sfn|Kerns|2012}} ''Willie & Family'' tours North America in the bio-diesel bus ''Honeysuckle Rose'', which is fueled by Bio-Willie.{{sfn|Vancouver Province staff|2007}} Nelson's tour buses were customized by Florida Coach since 1979. The company built the ''Honeysuckle Rose I'' in 1983, which was replaced after a collision in [[Nova Scotia]], Canada, in 1990. The interior was salvaged and reused for the second version of the bus the same year. Nelson changed his tour bus in 1996, 2005 and 2013, currently touring on the ''Honeysuckle Rose V''.{{sfn|Langer|2014}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Further|Willie Nelson albums discography|Willie Nelson singles discography|List of songs written by Willie Nelson}}\n;Solo studio albums\n<!--This section is just for solo studio albums.

His highest-charting hits are \"[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]\" (1992), \"[[Tender Moment]]\" (1993), and \"[[A Little Bit of You (Lee Roy Parnell song)|A Little Bit of You]]\" (1995), all of which peaked at No.&nbsp;2.

Besides his own work, Parnell has played [[slide guitar]] and [[National String Instrument Corporation|National guitar]] on several other country and blues recordings.\n\n==Early years==\nParnell was born in [[Abilene, Texas]], but raised in [[Stephenville, Texas]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Landon|first2=Grelun|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&q=%22lee+roy+parnell%22&pg=PA359|date=July 14, 2000|publisher=Macmillan|pages=359\u2013360|isbn=9780312264871}}</ref> His father had performed with [[Bob Wills]], and Parnell gave his first performance at age six on Wills' radio show.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Parnell played guitar and drums in various bands during his teenage years.

Although its lead-off single \"The Rock\" fell short of Top 40, the next three singles all reached Top Ten:<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \"[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]\" at No.&nbsp;2, the title track at No.&nbsp;8, and finally \"Tender Moment\" also at No.&nbsp;2. These three were also Top Ten hits on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' charts in Canada.\n\n===''On the Road''===\n1993's ''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'', Parnell's third album for the Arista label, also produced two top-10 hits: the [[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell song)|title track]] and \"I'm Holding My Own\", at No.&nbsp;6 and No.&nbsp;3 respectively. The album also contained a No.&nbsp;17-peaking rendition of the [[Hank Williams]] song \"Take These Chains from My Heart\", which Parnell recorded as a duet with [[Ronnie Dunn]] of [[Brooks & Dunn]], although Dunn was not credited on the chart. The final single from ''On the Road'', \"The Power of Love\", peaked at No.&nbsp;51.\n\n===''We All Get Lucky Sometimes''===\nParnell's fourth album, 1995's ''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'', was also his first for Career Records, then a newly formed subsidiary of [[Arista Nashville]]. This album's lead-off single \"A Little Bit of You\" was the third single of his career to reach No.&nbsp;2. Following it were the No.&nbsp;12 \"When a Woman Loves a Man\" (featuring background vocals by [[Trisha Yearwood]]), the No.&nbsp;3 \"Heart's Desire\" and another No.&nbsp;12 in \"Giving Water to a Drowning Man\". The album's title track, which was its fifth single, peaked at No.&nbsp;46.\n\n===''Every Night's a Saturday Night'' and ''Hits and Highways Ahead''===\n''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' was Parnell's final release for Career Records. This was his first album since his debut release that did not produce a Top Ten hit, and only three singles were released from it: \"Lucky Me, Lucky You\" at No.&nbsp;35, \"You Can't Get There From Here\" at No.&nbsp;39 (his final Top 40 hit), and \"All That Matters Anymore\" at No.&nbsp;50. After Career Records was merged back into Arista Nashville, Parnell released his final album for the Arista label, 1999's ''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]''. This album's only single, \"She Won't Be Lonely Long\", peaked at No.&nbsp;57, and by the year's end, Parnell exited Arista's roster.\n\n===''Tell the Truth'', ''Back to the Well'' and ''Midnight Believer''===\nIn 2000 Parnell signed to [[Vanguard Records]]<ref name=\"Rusty Russell 2009\"/> and released the album ''Tell the Truth''. This album's only single, \"South by Southwest\", failed to chart, and he soon left the label as well. Parnell's next album, ''Back to the Well'', came in 2006 on [[Universal South Records]], although it also produced only one non-charting single in \"Daddies and Daughters.\"\n\n==External contributions==\nBesides playing [[slide guitar]] and [[National guitar]] on his albums and co-writing several of his own songs, Parnell has co-written two Top 40 country hits for other artists: \"Too Much\" by [[Pirates of the Mississippi]] and \"[[That's My Story (song)|That's My Story]]\" by [[Collin Raye]], from 1992 and 1993 respectively. In 1994, he and [[Steve Wariner]] collaborated with [[Diamond Rio]] on a cover of [[Merle Haggard]]'s \"[[Workin' Man's Blues]]\", credited to Jed Zeppelin and recorded for a tribute album ''[[Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard]]''. This rendition peaked at No.&nbsp;48 on the country charts. He played slide guitar on [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]'s late-1994 Number One hit \"[[Shut Up and Kiss Me (Mary Chapin Carpenter song)|Shut Up and Kiss Me]]\", and appeared in the song's music video. Parnell added slide guitar to [[Delbert McClinton]]'s \"Sending Me Angels\" in 1997, and in late 2004, he was credited with playing slide guitar on [[David Lee Murphy]]'s No.&nbsp;46-peaking single \"Inspiration\", from the album ''[[Tryin' to Get There]]''.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Lee Roy Parnell discography}}\n\n;Studio albums\n*''[[Lee Roy Parnell (album)|Lee Roy Parnell]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Love Without Mercy]]'' (1992)\n*''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'' (1993)\n*''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' (1997)\n*''Tell the Truth'' (2001)\n*''Back to the Well'' (2006)\n*''Midnight Believer'' (2017)\n\n;Compilation albums\n*''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]'' (1999)\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*A{{anchor|endnote_A}}'''[[#ref_A|^]]''' Jed Zeppelin was an all-star group featuring [[Diamond Rio]], Lee Roy Parnell, and [[Steve Wariner]].\n\n{{refend}}\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Organization\n!Award\n!Nominee/Work\n!Result\n|-\n|1994\n|rowspan=2| [[Country Music Association Awards]]\n|[[Country Music Association Award for New Artist of the Year|Horizon Award]]\n|Lee Roy Parnell\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1995\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"[[Workin' Man Blues]]\" <small>with [[Diamond Rio]] and [[Steve Wariner]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1996\n|[[Grammy Awards]]\n|[[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]]\n|\"Cat Walk\" <small>with [[Flaco Jimenez]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1997\n|Country Music Association Awards\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"John the Revelator: Peace in the Valley\" <small>with [[The Fairfield Four]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1998\n|Grammy Awards\n|Best Country Instrumental Performance\n|\"Mama, Screw Your Wig On Tight\"\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- *Cronin, Peter. \"Parnell slips into the mainstream.\" ''Billboard'' 105.46 (Nov 13, 1993): 35.\n*Flippo, Chet. \"Parnell Revisits Hits and Looks `Ahead'; Remembering Music Pioneer Anita Carter.\" ''Billboard'' 111.33 (Aug 14, 1999): 28. \n*Huey, Steve.

She signed a publishing deal with Island Bound Music in 2014,and then signed a production deal with Scott Hendricks in 2015, and signed with RCA records in 2016.\n\nMany of Shawanda's songs have been inspired by her connections to Wiikwemkoong and part of her 2016 album was recorded at the Debajehmujig Creation Centre in [[Assiginack|Manitowaning, Manitoulin Island]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.manitoulin.ca/2016/04/27/crystal-shawanda-talks-two-new-albums-set-release-summer/|title=Crystal Shawanda talks about her two new albums set to release this summer|last=Burridge|first=Robin|date=2016-04-27|work=Manitoulin Expositor|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315070442/http://www.manitoulin.ca/2016/04/27/crystal-shawanda-talks-two-new-albums-set-release-summer/|archive-date=2018-03-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Music career==\nShawanda's first album, ''[[Dawn of a New Day (Crystal Shawanda album)|Dawn of a New Day]]'', was released in Canada on June 24, 2008, and in the United States on August 19. The album entered the Canadian Country Albums chart at number 2, and the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart at number 16. It became the highest charted album by a full-blooded Canadian First Nations country artist in the SoundScan era.<ref>[http://www.sonybmgnashville.com/pressreleases/details.cfm?artistid=1000010&pressid=1000520]{{dead link|date=August 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n\nShawanda toured with various artists across Canada and the northern United States in 2008. In 2009, she toured Canada and the United States with [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Dierks Bentley]] as a special guest on the Paisley Party 2009 tour. Her first single, \"You Can Let Go\", peaked at number 21 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. In mid-2009, Shawanda left RCA Nashville and, through her own record label, New Sun Records, and a distribution deal with EMI released a Christmas album titled ''I'll Be Home for Christmas''.\n\nIn 2010, Shawanda released a single, \"Beautiful Day\", via her own label, New Sun Records. Shawanda also performed at the [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in 2010, performing \"Let's Come Together\" and \"This Is My Land\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nashville.com/music/2010/11/crystal-shawanda-to-perform-at-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/ |title=Crystal Shawanda to Perform at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade \u00ab Nashville.com |accessdate=2014-02-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222192231/http://www.nashville.com/music/2010/11/crystal-shawanda-to-perform-at-macys-thanksgiving-day-parade/ |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}</ref> She then released another single, \"Love Enough\", on August 15, 2011, in both Canada and the United States, and in promotion she went on to tour with Reba. Shawanda's second studio album, ''[[Just Like You (Crystal Shawanda album)|Just Like You]]'', was released by New Sun on April 24, 2012, and won a Juno award for Aboriginal Album of the year in 2013. She became the first full blood Indigenous woman as the CEO of a record label, to procure these milestones.\n\nIn 2014, Shawanda made a departure from country music and released a Blues album titled \"The Whole World's got the Blues\",she focused on rather than regurgitating someone else's blues, she told her story as an Indigenous woman in \"Pray Sister Pray\", which raised awareness of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous women issue, across Canada. She filmed a music video in her hometown with the help of her community, and the music video is now being used in schools across Canada, as a teaching tool of this rising issue. This album was nominated for \"Aboriginal Album of the year\", and Shawanda was invited to perform at the Juno Awards opening Gala.\n\nIn 2016, Shawanda released her 4th album \"Fish out of water\", feeling torn between her future and her past, the album had a mix of Blues and country music songs, which ended up having am Americana sound. Perhaps best said by DMME.net \"She's a force of nature, Crystal Shawanda, the Canadian singer may reside in Nashville, but her casting as a country artist, whitewashed as the genre demands, is hopefully over\".\n\nIn 2017, Shawanda released \"Voo Doo Woman\", consisting of 6 covers of blues standards, and 4 originals. Later that year Crystal signed a record deal with True North Records, who rereleased the album later that year, and they achieved moderate airplay at Blues Radio in America.\n\nIn 2020, Shawanda released \"Church House Blues\",which had extensive airplay at Blues Radio in America, and in Europe. She also went on to become the first Indigenous woman to win a Juno award for \"Blues album of the year\".\n\nIn 2022 Crystal released \"Midnight Blues\", which debuted at #8 on the American Billboard blues chart, and she became the first full blood Indigenous person to appear on this chart. She also received extensive airplay at Blues radio. This album was also nominated for \"blues album of the year\" at the Juno awards.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"45\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]<br><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/crystal-shawanda/chart-history/clp/|title=Crystal Shawanda- Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref>\n! width=\"45\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]<br /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/crystal-shawanda/chart-history/tlp/|title=Crystal Shawanda - Billboard 200|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=April 30, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Dawn of a New Day (Crystal Shawanda album)|Dawn of a New Day]]''\n| \n* Release date: June 24, 2008\n* Label: [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]]\n| 16\n| 81\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''I'll Be Home for Christmas''\n| \n* Release date: December 1, 2009\n* Label: New Sun/EMI/On Ramp Records\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Just Like You (Crystal Shawanda album)|Just Like You]]''\n| \n* Release date: April 24, 2012\n* Label: New Sun Records/[[Fontana North]]\n| _\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''The Whole World's Got the Blues''\n| \n* Release date: September 30, 2014\n* Label: New Sun Records\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Fish Out of Water''\n|\n* Release date: October 2016\n* Label: New Sun Records\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Voodoo Woman''\n|\n* Release date: October 31, 2017\n* Label: New Sun Records/Fontana North\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Church House Blues''\n|\n* Release date: April 17, 2020\n* Label: True North Records\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n|Midnight Blues                               \n|Release date: 2022\nLabel: True North Records\n|8\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\" |\n|-\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n;Notes\n{{refbegin}}\n*a<span id=\"endnote_a\" ></span>'''[[#ref_a|^]]''' \"You Can Let Go\" also reached number nine on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] chart.<ref name=\"whitburn\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc|page=376|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref>\n{{refend}}\n\n====As a featured artist====\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Single\n!

He was known for performing in [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. Allman grew up with an interest in [[rhythm and blues]] music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with rock music, [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] at times. He wrote several of the band's most popular songs, including \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", \"[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]\", and \"[[Midnight Rider]]\". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven studio albums. He was born and spent much of his childhood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], before relocating to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] and then [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\nHe and his brother [[Duane Allman]] formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 live album ''[[At Fillmore East]]'', but shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, and released  ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', which became their most successful album, in 1973. Allman began a solo career with ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' the same year. He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star [[Cher]]. He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song \"[[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|I'm No Angel]]\" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, ''[[Low Country Blues]]'' (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance use, which formed the basis of his memoir ''[[My Cross to Bear]]'' (2012).

In 1991, she signed to [[BNA Records]] (then known as BNA Entertainment), releasing her self-titled debut album that year. This album produced two singles for her on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Stewart is a BMI Award winning songwriter and has  appeared in films alongside Oscar winners Gwynneth Paltrow and Melissa Leo. She currently tours with her jazz combo.\n\n==Life and career==\nStewart was born August 6, 1968, in [[Louisville, Mississippi]].<ref name=\"miss\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mswritersandmusicians.com/musicians/lisa-stewart.html |title=Lisa Stewart, Mississippi country singer |accessdate=July 25, 2008 |last=Glass |first=Paul |work=Mississippi Writers and Musicians}}</ref> She first sang in public at age six in her church. Five years later, she attended a Tent Show at the Nashville Fan Fair, where she gave her first country performance. By 1987, Stewart had moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she won the Roy Acuff scholarship at Belmont University and found work as a studio singer.\n\nWhile performing at a wedding reception in 1991, Stewart was noticed by Mark Thompson, [[Wynonna Judd]]'s bandleader, who asked Stewart to sing demos for him. After recording the demos, Stewart signed to a recording contract with BNA Entertainment (now known as [[BNA Records]]), releasing her debut single \"Somebody's in Love\" in late 1992. This song was the first of three singles from her self-titled debut album \u2014 which was released in January 1993 \u2014 followed by \"Under the Light of the Texaco\" and \"Drive Time\". Also included on the album was a cover of [[Jeannie Seely]]'s 1966 single \"Don't Touch Me\".\n\nIn addition to promoting her album on radio tours, Stewart hosted the nationally syndicated entertainment news show ''#1 Country''. She also made appearances on [[The Nashville Network]], hosting their programs ''Yesteryear'' and ''This Week in Country Music'' and was a featured performer on \"Music City Tonight\". \n\nIn 1994, she recorded her second album for BNA. Produced by [[Barry Beckett]], the album was entitled <i>Solitary Heart</i>, and the first single was set to be \"[[Let's Go to Vegas]]\" (later a Top 5 hit for [[Faith Hill]]), but after a shakeup at the label, Stewart was dropped and the album was shelved. \n\nFrom 1997-1999, she co-hosted <i>This Week in Country Music</i> with Steve Phillips on TNN. She also continued to tour throughout the late 1990s.\n\nStewart began acting in the 21st century under her married name of Lisa Stewart Seals,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/lisa-stewart-seals-movie/ |title=Lisa Stewart Seals Scores Role in Tim McGraw Movie |website=Theboot.com |date= 8 February 2010|accessdate=2020-04-04}}</ref> but is currently known as Lisa Stewart.\n\nShe is now making a mark in the jazz world and performs with her combo, often featuring Chester Thompson on drums (Genesis, Weather Report, Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention).\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:12em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n|- \n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Lisa Stewart (album)|Lisa Stewart]]''\n| \n* Release date: January 1993\n* Label: [[BNA Records]]\n* Format: CD, [[audio cassette|cassette]]\n|}\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Single\n! colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart<br />positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[Hot Country Songs|US Country]]\n! style=\"width:45px;\"| [[RPM (magazine)|CAN Country]]\n|-\n| 1992\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Somebody's in Love\"\n| 61\n| \u2014\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"| 1993\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Under the Light of the Texaco\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/90s/1993/BB-1993-06-19.pdf|title=Single Reviews|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=June 19, 1993}}</ref>\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| \"Drive Time\"\n| 72\n| 60\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!
