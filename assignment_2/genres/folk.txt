Two of these singles succeeded in making the lower reaches of the Billboard country music charts. Her debut studio album for Capitol, ''[[Somewhere Between (album)|Somewhere Between]]'' was released in March 1989. ''Somewhere Between'', with its blend of traditional and contemporary styles, drew positive reviews from critics. The album's second single, \"Cross My Broken Heart,\" became a top-20 hit on the country music charts. The same year, Bogguss won the award for Top New Female Vocalist by the [[Academy of Country Music]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/e55633900c6bceb10404c1c6a0b3be43|title=Winners of the 24th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards With PM-Country Awards|location=Burbank, California|work=Associated Press News|date=April 11, 1989|access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFor her second album, ''[[Moment of Truth (Suzy Bogguss album)|Moment of Truth]]'', production tasks were taken over by new label-head and Nashville producer [[Jimmy Bowen]], who moved Bogguss's sound in a more polished direction. However, the album's two singles failed to rise beyond the lower reaches of the Billboard charts. A duet she recorded with [[Lee Greenwood]], \"Hopelessly Yours,\" went to No.&nbsp;12 on the country singles chart and received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nIn 1991 Bogguss released her third studio album, the platinum-selling ''[[Aces (Suzy Bogguss)|Aces]]''. The LP yielded four hit singles - \"[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]\", \"[[Outbound Plane]]\", \"[[Aces (song)|Aces]]\", and \"[[Letting Go (Suzy Bogguss song)|Letting Go]]\", the latter three reaching the country Top Ten.

The album's first single, a cover of the 1988 song \"[[Drive South]]\" by [[John Hiatt]], missed the No.&nbsp;1 spot but gave Bogguss the highest-charting hit of her career to date. Her streak continued the following year with another gold record, ''[[Something Up My Sleeve]]'', giving her two additional Top Five hits in \"[[Just Like the Weather]]\" and \"[[Hey Cinderella]]\". The latter, which she cowrote with [[Matraca Berg]] and Gary Harrison, has gone on to become one of Bogguss's [[signature song]]s. In May 1993, Bogguss appeared on the CBS television special ''The Women of Country''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-04-27-ca-27667-story.html|title=Morning Report - Television|last=Snow|first=Shauna|date=April 27, 1993|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=May 30, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEventually, Bogguss became the sole producer of her sixth studio album, ''[[Simpatico (Atkins/Bogguss)|Simpatico]]''. The album consisted of duets with long-time friend and guitarist [[Chet Atkins]]. The album was released in 1994, and though it was generally well reviewed, its only single, \"One More for the Road,\" did not chart. That same year, Bogguss's ''[[Greatest Hits (Suzy Bogguss)|Greatest Hits]]'' album was released and went gold. Later, Bogguss collaborated with [[Alison Krauss]], [[Kathy Mattea]], and [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] to contribute \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit compilation album [[Red Hot + Country]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nUpon completing ''Simpatico'', Bogguss temporarily set her music aside to start a family.

During her break, the climate of country music had changed considerably, with more pop-oriented female singers such as [[Martina McBride]], [[Faith Hill]], and [[Shania Twain]] dominating the charts. Bogguss's traditional, straightforward style failed to connect with younger listeners, and the record yielded low sales. In March 1997, Bogguss performed at the Every Woman's Challenge charity concert, which was held at the [[Palm Springs Convention Center]] in California.<ref name=\"LATInterview\"/>\n\nAfter her next album, 1998's ''[[Nobody Love, Nobody Gets Hurt]]'', also proved unsuccessful, Bogguss was dropped from Capitol. On February 18, 1999, Bogguss issued the following statement:\n\n{{cquote|I had a great tenure with Capitol, during which I weathered a lot of changes in both personnel and philosophy.

The label's first album, ''Live at Caff\u00e9 Milano'', documents three separate 1999 performances at the Caff\u00e9 Milano in Nashville. This release is only available for purchase at Bogguss's official website.

Her first release on this label was the [[Western swing]] album, ''Swing'', that she had been recording with producer [[Ray Benson]], the bandleader of Western swing group [[Asleep at the Wheel]]. Although the album saw only lukewarm sales (it reached No.&nbsp;6 on the jazz album charts, but failed to appear on the Billboard 200), it was well received by critics. Bogguss' next album, ''Sweet Danger'', was released in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1570099/suzy-bogguss-finds-herself-in-sweet-danger.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509115504/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1570099/suzy-bogguss-finds-herself-in-sweet-danger.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 9, 2008|title=Suzy Bogguss Finds Herself in Sweet Danger|last=Shelburne|first=Craig|publisher=CMT|date=September 19, 2007|access-date=May 23, 2013}}</ref> The album peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the jazz charts.

Aces also was her break out album which brought her serious attention on Country Radio and secured her future on Capitol Nashville for several more albums.  On August 18, 2016, the actual 25th anniversary of the release of the original Aces album, she released a new re-imagined and rerecorded version of the album entitled ''Aces Redux''. A release party and concert was held that night at the \"3rd and Lindsley\" venue in Nashville. ''Aces Redux'' was recorded with the help of a number of the musicians that have toured with Bogguss over the years and included background vocals by friends [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]] and [[Kim Carnes]] along with several others.   The album takes a more acoustic and simpler production tack than the original which also reflects her more recent touring approach as a trio with Charlie Chadwick on standup Bass and Craig Smith on lead guitar.\n\nBogguss's 17th studio album, ''Prayin' for Sunshine'', was released on November 3, 2023. It marks the first time she is credited as a writer of all songs on one of her albums.

The eight band members, all from the Leahy family of 11 siblings, are from [[Lakefield, Ontario]] and have been touring Canada and internationally since the early 1980s, when they were known as '''The Leahy Family'''. In 1985, they were the subject of a short film entitled ''Leahy: Music Most of All'' which received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in the category of \"Best Foreign Student Film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/saa/winners/winners.pdf |title=Student Film Award Winners -- By Year |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229173821/http://www.oscars.org/awards/saa/winners/winners.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2012 }}</ref>\nThe members of Leahy take significant pride in their Irish roots and Canadian upbringing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://irishamerica.com/2006/10/leahy-staying-true-to-the-tune/ | title=Leahy: Staying True to the Tune | date=October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe line-up of the group varies depending upon the availability of its members, who are present or absent due to marriage, childrearing and other obligations. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the band recorded a number of privately released LPs and cassettes (most of which used the same title, ''The Leahy Family'') which were sold at their concerts and they were frequent guests at the [[Big Valley Jamboree]] concerts in [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]].\n\nIn 1997, the band resumed recording with their \"relaunch\" album, ''[[Leahy (album)|Leahy]]'' which also introduced the group's new branding. ''Leahy'' was an instrumental album, but the band also includes vocal performances in their live performances and subsequent albums have included both vocals and instrumentals.\n\nDespite their established history, they were awarded two [[Juno Awards of 1998|Juno awards in 1998]], for [[Juno Award for New Group of the Year|Best New Group]]<ref name=\"Inc.1998\">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=McLaughlin at top of Juno nominations|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|date=21 February 1998|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=14\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and [[Juno Award for Instrumental Album of the Year|Best Instrumental Artist]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://junoawards.ca/database/artist-summary/?artist_name=leahy |title=(Juno Awards Database Lookup) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723180613/http://junoawards.ca/database/artist-summary/?artist_name=leahy |archivedate=2011-07-23 }}</ref>  The following year, Leahy took a third Juno Award, for [[Juno Award for Country Recording of the Year|Best Country Group or Duo]]. Also in 1998, Leahy were added as the opening act for Canadian country singer [[Shania Twain]]'s 1998 [[Come on Over Tour]] and were featured in two television specials from the tour, ''[[Live (Shania Twain DVD)|Live]]'' and ''[[The Specials (Shania Twain DVD)|The Specials]]'', performing with Twain on the song \"[[Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)]]\".<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=The Specials (Winter Break / Come On Over) |others=[[Shania Twain]] |year=2001 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Shania-Twain-Specials-Winter-Break/dp/product-description/B00005RIIO |at=Back Cover |type=DVD |publisher=Mercury |id=B00005RIIO |location=Nashville }}</ref>\n\nThe group's members are both instrumentalists and dancers, with several members skilled in fiddle-playing (most notably the band's most famous member, Donnell). The female members of the band often perform [[step-dancing]]-style routines and do most of the singing.\n\n==Members==\n[[File:Leahy.jpg|thumb|Leahy in concert at the Fergus Scottish Festival in 2009]]\nAll members of the band are siblings.

Kramer in Latham, Sean (ed.), 2021, ''The World of Bob Dylan'', pp. 251\u2013263.</ref>\n\nDylan was born and raised in [[St. Louis County, Minnesota]]. Following [[Bob Dylan (album)|his self-titled debut album]] of traditional [[Folk-songs|folk songs]] in 1962, he made his breakthrough with ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' (1963). The album featured \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\", which adapted the tunes and phrasing of older folk songs. He released the politically charged ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'' in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan [[Electric Dylan controversy|drew controversy]] among folk purists when he adopted [[Amplifier|electrically amplified]] rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most influential rock albums of the 1960s: ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'', ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' and ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]''. When Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to rock, the mix became more complex. His six-minute single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.<ref name=LARS>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-20110516| title=500 Greatest Songs Of All Time| date=April 7, 2011| access-date=January 6, 2020|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]| archive-date=October 31, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031103816/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-151127/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-2-54028/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Rogovoy|first=Seth| title=How Bob Dylan's greatest song changed music history \u2014 a deep-dive into an accidental masterpiece| url=https://forward.com/culture/475865/how-bob-dylans-greatest-song-changed-music-history-a-deep-dive-into-an/| date=September 27, 2021| access-date=September 30, 2021| url-status=live| archive-date=September 28, 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210928170718/https://forward.com/culture/475865/how-bob-dylans-greatest-song-changed-music-history-a-deep-dive-into-an/| quote=Bruce Springsteen, who was originally touted as a 'new Dylan' when he was signed to Columbia Records, Dylan's label, by the same label honcho, John Hammond, who signed Dylan, said this about 'Like a Rolling Stone':<br />'Dylan freed your mind and showed us that because the music was physical did not mean it was anti-intellect. He had the vision and talent to make a pop song so that it contained the whole world. He invented a new way a pop singer could sound, broke through the limitations of what a recording could achieve, and he changed the face of rock 'n' roll for ever and ever.'| publisher=[[The Forward]]}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylan's withdrawal from touring. During this period, he recorded [[List of Basement Tapes songs|a large body of songs]] with members of [[the Band]], who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were later released as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'' in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored [[country music]] and rural themes on ''[[John Wesley Harding]]'' (1967), ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969) and ''[[New Morning]]'' (1970). In 1975, he released ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] and released three albums of contemporary [[gospel music]] before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's [[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|''Time Out of Mind'']] (1997) marked the beginning of a career renaissance. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since, most recently ''[[Rough and Rowdy Ways]]'' (2020). He also recorded a trilogy of albums covering the [[Great American Songbook]], especially songs sung by [[Frank Sinatra]], and an album smoothing his early rock material into a mellower [[Americana (music)|Americana]] sensibility, ''[[Shadow Kingdom]]'' (2023). Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the [[Never Ending Tour]].<ref>Heylin, Clinton, 2011, ''Bob Dylan: Behind The Shades, The 20th Anniversary Edition'', pp. 646\u2013652.</ref>\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published [[Bob Dylan bibliography#Art books by Bob Dylan|nine books of paintings and drawings]], and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.

While Shelton was writing Dylan's biography in the 1960s, Dylan told him, \"Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas's poetry is for people that aren't really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance.\" At the University of Minnesota, Dylan told a few friends that Dillon was his mother's maiden name, which was untrue. He later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon. Shelton added that only when he reached New York in 1961 did he begin to spell his name \"Dylan\", by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Shelton (2011), pp. 44\u201345.</ref> In a 2004 interview, he said, \"You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself.

He came to feel it was a label the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, ''[[Chronicles, Volume One|Chronicles]]'', Dylan wrote: \"The press never let up. Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an interview so they wouldn't beat the door down.

In his teens, he decided upon a career as a [[rodeo]] rider. Recovering from injuries sustained from a fall during the mid-1950s, he started learning guitar. In the late 1950s, he relocated to Toronto, aspiring to a career as a commercial artist. He also started playing clubs and coffeehouses in Toronto.<ref name=\"ch\">{{cite web|url=http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000752|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205043718/http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000752|url-status=dead|title=Coffeehouses|archive-date=December 5, 2005}}</ref> By 1959 he was performing music as a full-time occupation.\n\n[[Sylvia Tyson]], n\u00e9e Fricker, CM, was born in Chatham, Ontario in 1940. While still in her teens, she started frequenting the folk clubs of Toronto.\n\n===Career===\n====Folk duo====\nThe two started performing together in Toronto in 1959. By 1962, they were living in New York City, where they caught the attention of manager [[Albert Grossman]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilliland, John. |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1692106/m1/#track/9 |title=Pop Chronicles Interviews #184 - Ian and Sylvia Tyson - All Tracks UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |date=1968-01-12 |accessdate=2021-03-02}}</ref> who managed [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] and would soon become [[Bob Dylan]]'s manager. Grossman secured them a contract with [[Vanguard Records]] and they released their first album late in the year.<ref name=\"canadianmusichalloffame.ca\"/>\n\nTheir first album, self-titled ''Ian & Sylvia'', on Vanguard Records consists mainly of traditional songs.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=August 25, 1962|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=24|title=Ian & Sylvia|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> There were British and Canadian folk songs, spiritual music, and a few [[blues]] songs thrown into the mix. The album was moderately successful and they made the list of performers for the 1963 [[Newport Folk Festival]].\n\n''Four Strong Winds'', their second album, was similar to the first, with the exception of the inclusion of the early Dylan composition \"[[Tomorrow Is a Long Time]]\" and the title song \"[[Four Strong Winds]]\", written by Ian Tyson. \"Four Strong Winds\" was a major hit in Canada and ensured their stardom.<ref>[http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1963/Ch196310.html 30 Years of Canadian Chart Listings] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20021102214504/http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1963/Ch196310.html |date=2002-11-02 }} - #9 on 28 October 1963</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Ian & Sylvia|date=October 19, 1963|journal=Billboard Magazine|page=18|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Years later, the song was named as the greatest Canadian song of all time by the CBC-Radio program ''50 Tracks: The Canadian Version''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe two married in June 1964; they also released their third album, ''Northern Journey'', that year. It included a song written by Sylvia, titled \"[[You Were on My Mind]]\", recorded by both the California group [[We Five]] (a 1965 #4 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, #1 on the Cashbox chart, #3 on the Billboard Hot 100) and British [[folk rock]] singer [[Crispian St. Peters]] (#29 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, #36 in 1967).<ref>Joel Whitburn, ''Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits''</ref> A recording of \"Four Strong Winds\" by [[Bobby Bare]] made it to #3 on the [[country music|country]] charts around that time.\n\nOn the ''Northern Journey'' album was the song \"[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]\", a composition by Ian Tyson that would rival \"Four Strong Winds\" in its popularity. (Both songs would eventually be recorded by dozens of singers.)\n\nTheir fourth album, ''Early Morning Rain'', consisted in large part of new songs. They introduced the work of the couple's fellow Canadian songwriter and performer [[Gordon Lightfoot]] through the title song and \"(That's What You Get) For Lovin' Me\". They also included the first recording of the song \"[[Darcy Farrow]]\" by [[Steve Gillette]] and Tom Campbell, as well as a number of their own compositions.\n \nThey performed at the [[1965 Newport Folk Festival]].<ref name=pc32>{{Pop Chronicles |32| 1}}</ref> ''Play One More'', their offering of 1965, showed a move toward the electrified folk-like music that was becoming popular with groups like [[the Byrds]] and [[the Lovin' Spoonful]]. The title tune used horns to evoke the [[mariachi]] style.\n\nIn 1967, they released two albums, one recorded for Vanguard, the other for [[MGM]]. These two efforts, ''So Much For Dreaming'' and ''Lovin' Sound'', were far less dynamic presentations.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1975, Ian Tyson hosted ''The Ian Tyson Show'' on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], known as ''Nashville North'' in its first season. Sylvia Tyson and the Great Speckled Bird appeared often on the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/17889/ian_tyson_show,_the/details/ | title=Ian Tyson Show, The (Series) (1970-1975) |date=February 2003 | access-date=July 18, 2019 | publisher=TV Archive}}</ref>\n\n====Country rock pioneers====\nThey moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where they recorded two albums; one to fulfill the terms of their Vanguard contract, the other to supply MGM with a second (and last) album for that label. The albums can be defined as early [[country rock]] music; ''Nashville'' for Vanguard was cut in February 1968, one month before the Byrds' ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'', widely considered the first collaboration of rock and Nashville players.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone-Nashville\"/> Three of Bob Dylan's ''[[Basement Tapes]]'' songs are included on their Nashville albums; most of the rest were written by Ian or Sylvia.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone-Nashville\">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-ian-sylvias-nashville-country-rocks-great-lost-album-20150722 | title=Inside Ian & Sylvia's 'Nashville,' Country-Rock's Great Lost Album | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=July 22, 2015 | access-date=October 11, 2016 | author=Browne, David | author-link=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Ian & Sylvia formed the [[country rock]] group [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|Great Speckled Bird]]. In addition to participating in the cross-Canada rock-and-roll rail tour [[Festival Express]], they recorded [[Great Speckled Bird (album)|a self-titled album]] for the short-lived [[Ampex]] label. Produced by [[Todd Rundgren]], the record failed when Ampex was unable to establish widespread distribution. Thousands of copies never left the warehouse, and it has become a much sought-after collector's item. Initially, the album artist was given as Great Speckled Bird but later copies had a sticker saying that it featured the duo.\n\nIan & Sylvia's last two albums were recorded on [[Columbia Records]]. The first, 1971's ''Ian and Sylvia'' (not to be confused with their 1962 self-titled release) consists largely of mainstream country-flavored songs. This album was released on CD, with extra tracks, as ''The Beginning of the End'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r245993|pure_url=yes}}|title=''The Beginning of the End''|website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2012-04-04}}</ref> Their second Columbia record, 1972's ''You Were on My Mind'', featured a later incarnation of Great Speckled Bird. The songs range from hard country rock to middle-of-the-road country material. Neither of the Columbia albums sold well. They were eventually combined and released as 1974's ''The Best of Ian and Sylvia''.\n\nIn 1972, Ian & Sylvia performed the song \"Let Her Alone\" for [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]' live-action drama ''[[Run, Cougar, Run]]''. Ian also served as the film's narrator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://every70smovie.blogspot.com/2016/08/run-cougar-run-1972.html|title=Every 70s Movie: Run, Cougar, Run (1972)|first=Peter|last=Hanson|website=Every70smovie.blogspot.com|date=August 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy 1975, Ian & Sylvia had stopped performing together and soon afterwards were divorced. Their final appearance as a duo was in May 1975 at the [[Horseshoe Tavern]] in Toronto.<ref name=ce/>\n\n===Post-divorce===\nAfter their marriage ended in 1975, Ian returned to Southern Alberta to farm and train horses, but continued his musical career.

Her follow up album, ''[[Stones in the Road]]'', appeared two years later and won Carpenter the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album]], while going double platinum for shipments of two million copies. After a number of commercially unsuccessful albums throughout the first decade of the 21st century, she exited Columbia for [[Zo\u00eb Records]]. Her first album for this label was 2007's ''[[The Calling (Mary Chapin Carpenter album)|The Calling]]''.

Erlewine wrote that Carpenter \"found favor on country radio in the 1980s and '90s by taking her emotionally intelligent songs to a mass audience.\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Of her 1980s albums, he stated that \"Country radio was hesitant to play her soft, folky, [[feminism|feminist]] material, but she received good reviews and airplay on more progressive country stations, as well as college radio\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> In the ''Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', Colin Larkin noted the use of electric guitar in her more upbeat material such as \"Passionate Kisses\" and \"The Hard Way\", while also referring to \"House of Cards\" as \"thought-provoking\".<ref name=\"virgin\"/> He also stated, \"she, together with the likes of Trisha Yearwood, [[Suzy Bogguss]], and Kathy Mattea, has brought fresh melody to an old and sometimes predictable genre.\"<ref name=\"virgin\"/> Larry Katz of the ''[[Red Deer Advocate]]'' contrasted her with Yearwood and Wynonna Judd, noting that unlike those artists, Carpenter usually wrote her songs herself instead of relying on Nashville-based songwriters.<ref name=\"red deer\"/> Alanna Nash of ''Entertainment Weekly'' thought that by being a graduate of an [[Ivy League]] college, Carpenter \"seemed the least likely female to go the distance on the country charts\".<ref name=\"women\"/> Similarly, Katz thought that her upbringing was atypical of country music, which is more commonly associated with demographics pertaining to the rural [[Southern United States]].<ref name=\"red deer\"/>\n\nNash also noted the difference between \"decidedly noncountry themes like [[Halley\u2019s Comet]] and the spiritual life of old shirts\" in contrast to her more up-tempo material such as \"Down at the Twist and Shout\".<ref name=\"women\"/> In a review of ''Stones in the Road'' for the same publication, Browne contrasted that album with ''Come On Come On'', saying of the latter that \"her square-jawed voice, leaner lyrics, and the sturdy-as-a-wooden-fence folk rock combined to make a deserved[...]breakthrough.\"<ref name=\"stones browne\"/> He also said of her writing style that Carpenter \"sounds like someone who sits down and thinks about it \u2014 a lot \u2014 before committing it to song.

He also stated that the former song had a theme of \"desire\", and the latter a \"call to self-fulfillment\".<ref name=\"eli\"/> Keefe found influences of folk and [[country pop]] in her 1990s albums, but thought that much of her work in the 21st century was \"mixed\" due to a lack of uptempo material and lyrical themes which he considered too similar to each other.

She played guitar, [[banjo]], harmonica, and [[autoharp]], and acted in several films and television shows.

Her mother was a country music performer with June's aunt Sara and uncle [[A. P. Carter]] and she performed with the Carter Family from the age of 10, in 1939. In March 1943, when the Carter Family trio stopped recording together at the end of the [[WBT (AM)|WBT]] contract, Maybelle Carter, with encouragement from her husband Ezra, formed \"The Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle\" with her daughters, Helen on accordion, Anita Carter on bass fiddle and June on autoharp and as front person and comedian. The new group first aired on radio station [[WRNL]] in [[Richmond, Virginia]], on June 1. Doc (Addington) and Carl (McConnell)\u2014Maybelle's brother and cousin, respectively, known as \"The Virginia Boys\", joined them in late 1945. June, then 16, was a co-announcer with Ken Allyn and did the commercials on the radio shows for Red Star Flour, Martha White, and [[Thalhimers|Thalhimers Department Store]], just to name a few.<ref name=\"JUNE CARTER CASH BIOGRAPHY\">{{Citation | url = http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/cash_june_carter/bio.jhtml | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040106040953/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/cash_june_carter/bio.jhtml | url-status = dead | archive-date = January 6, 2004 | title = Artists | contribution = June Carter Cash | type = biography | publisher = CMT}}</ref> For the next year {1946}, the Carters and Doc and Carl did show dates within driving range of Richmond, through [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[Delaware]], and [[Pennsylvania]].

With her thin and lanky frame, June Carter often played a comedic foil during the group's performances alongside other Opry stars [[Faron Young]] and [[Webb Pierce]]. Carl McConnell wrote in his memoirs that June was \"a natural-born clown, if there ever was one\". Decades later, Carter revived Aunt Polly for the 1976 TV series ''Johnny Cash & Friends''.\n\nAfter Doc and Carl dropped out of the music business in late 1946, Maybelle and her daughters moved to [[Sunshine Sue|Sunshine Sue Workman's]] \"Old Dominion Barn Dance\" on the [[WRVA (AM)|WRVA]] Richmond station. After a while there, they moved to [[WNOX]] in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], where they met [[Chet Atkins]] with Homer and Jethro.\n\nIn 1949, the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle, with their lead guitarist, Atkins, were living in [[Springfield, Missouri]], and performing regularly at [[KWTO (AM)|KWTO]]. Ezra \"Eck\" Carter, Maybelle's husband and manager of the group, declined numerous offers from the [[Grand Ole Opry]] to move the act to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], because the Opry would not permit Atkins to accompany the group onstage. Atkins' reputation as a guitar player had begun to spread, and studio musicians were fearful that he would displace them as a 'first-call' player if he came to Nashville. Finally, in 1950, Opry management relented and the group, along with Atkins, became part of the Opry company. Here the family befriended [[Hank Williams]] and [[Elvis Presley]] (to whom they were distantly related), and June met Johnny Cash.\n\nCarter and her sisters, with their mother Maybelle and aunt Sara joining in from time to time, reclaimed the name \"The Carter Family\" for their act during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n==Career highlights==\n[[File:President Richard Nixon, Pat Nixon, June Carter Cash, and Johnny Cash.jpg|thumb|Cash with husband [[Johnny Cash|Johnny]], President [[Richard Nixon]] and First Lady [[Pat Nixon]] on April 17, 1970.]]\nWhile Carter may be best known for singing and songwriting, she was also an author, dancer, actress, comedian, philanthropist, and humanitarian.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://johnnycash.com/june/june2.html |contribution=June |title=Johnny Cash.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813152000/http://www.johnnycash.com/june/june2.html |archive-date=August 13, 2008 }}</ref> Director [[Elia Kazan]] saw her perform at the Grand Ole Opry in 1955 and encouraged her to study acting.

As a solo artist, she became somewhat successful with upbeat country tunes of the 1950s, such as \"Jukebox Blues\" and the comedic hit \"No Swallerin' Place\" by Frank Loesser. Carter also recorded \"The Heel\" in the 1960s along with many other songs.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Carter wrote the song \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\", which later went on to be a hit for her future husband, Johnny Cash. She co-wrote the song with fellow songwriter [[Merle Kilgore]]. Carter wrote the lyrics about her relationship with Cash and she offered the song to her sister, [[Anita Carter]], who was the first singer to record the song. In 1963, Cash recorded the song with the Carter Family singing backup and added mariachi horns. The song became a number-one hit and went on to become one of the most recognizable songs in the world of country music.\nIn her autobiography, ''I Walked the Line'', Cash's first wife [[Vivian Cash]] disputes the myth that Carter co-wrote the song \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\". Vivian relates the story that Cash told her in 1963: he wrote the song with Kilgore and Curly Lewis while fishing and he was going to give Carter half credit because \"She needs the money. And I feel sorry for her.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cash, with Ann Sharpsteen |first1=Vivian |title=I Walked the Line: My Life with Johnny |date=2007 |publisher=Scribner |page=338}}</ref>\n\nCarter's first notable studio performance with Johnny Cash occurred in 1964 when she duetted with Cash on \"[[It Ain't Me Babe]]\", a [[Bob Dylan]] composition, that was released as a single and on Cash's album ''[[Orange Blossom Special (album)|Orange Blossom Special]]''. In 1967, the two found more substantial success with their recording of \"[[Jackson (Johnny Cash and June Carter song)|Jackson]]\", which was followed by a collaboration album, ''[[Carryin' On with Johnny Cash and June Carter]]''. All these releases predated her marriage to Cash, after which she changed her professional name to June Carter Cash. She continued to work with Cash on recordings and on stage for the rest of her life, recording a number of duets with Cash for his various albums and being a regular on ''[[The Johnny Cash Show]]'' from 1969 to 1971 and on Cash's annual Christmas specials. After ''Carryin' On'', Carter recorded one more direct collaboration album, ''[[Johnny Cash and His Woman]]'', released in 1973, and, along with her daughters, was a featured vocalist on Cash's 1974 album ''[[The Junkie and the Juicehead Minus Me]]''. She also shared sleeve credit with her husband on a 2000 small-label gospel release, ''[[Return to the Promised Land]].''\n\nAlthough she provided vocals on many recordings and shared the billing with Cash on several album releases, June Carter Cash only recorded three solo albums during her lifetime: the first, ''[[Appalachian Pride]]'', released in 1975, ''[[Press On (June Carter Cash album)|Press On]]'' (1999), and ''[[Wildwood Flower (album)|Wildwood Flower]]'', released posthumously in 2003 and produced by her son, [[John Carter Cash]]. ''Appalachian Pride'' is the only one of the three on which Johnny Cash does not perform, while ''Press On'' is notable for featuring Carter singing her original arrangement of \"Ring of Fire\".\n\nOne of her final appearances was a non-speaking/non-singing appearance in the music video for her husband's 2003 single, \"[[Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)|Hurt]]\", filmed a few months before her death. One of her last known public appearances was on April 7, 2003, just over a month before her death, when she appeared on the [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT Flameworthy]] awards program to accept an achievement award on behalf of her husband, who was too ill to attend.\n\nShe won a Grammy award in 1999 for, ''Press On''. Her last album, ''Wildwood Flower'', won two additional Grammys. It contains bonus video enhancements showing extracts from the film of the recording sessions, which took place at the Carter Family estate in [[Hiltons, Virginia]], on September 18\u201320, 2002. The songs on the album include \"Big Yellow Peaches\", \"Sinking in the Lonesome Sea\", \"Temptation\", and the trademark staple \"[[Wildwood Flower]]\". Due to her involvement in providing backing vocals on many of her husband's recordings, a further posthumous release occurred in 2014, when ''[[Out Among the Stars]]'' was released under Johnny Cash's name. The album consists of previously unreleased recordings from the early 1980s, including two on which June Carter Cash provides duet vocals.\n\nHer autobiography was published in 1979, and she wrote a memoir, ''From the Heart'', almost 10 years later.<ref name = \"mtv\" />\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:JohnnyCashJuneCarterCash1969.jpg|thumb|Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash in 1969]]\nCarter was married three times and had one child with each husband.

Jones's career gained wider critical acclaim in 2006 with the release of her album, ''[[My Remembrance of You]]''.  The album made a number of critics end-of-the-year \"best of\" lists.  The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' rated the album as the \"best country recording of 2006\" and described Jones as \"an Americana gem\", whose sound rides \"an old-timey vibe that never sounds fussy, ... in a voice subtly shaded by the high lonesome sound.\"<ref name = \"Tribune\">Chrissie Dickinson, \"The Best of 2006: Music Recordings: Country: No substitute for experience\", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', December 10, 2006 ([http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/chi-0612090228dec10,1,7127316.story?coll=chi-ent_music-hed article]{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})</ref>\n\nJones has also won a number of songwriting competitions including the venerable \"New Folk\" competition at the 2006 [[Kerrville Folk Festival]].

She was first drawn to [[country music]] in the early 1980s while attending high school on [[Long Island]].

He knew all those songs...I felt like I had discovered the source of what I had been trying to find musically.\"<ref name = \"Dispatch\"/>\n\nIn the 1990s Jones continued to develop as a writer and performer in the [[Music of Austin|music scene]] around [[Austin, Texas]] She released two albums, signed a deal with Hamstein Publishing,<ref name = \"Hamstein\">[http://www.hamstein.com/ Hamstein] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228172325/http://www.hamstein.com/ |date=February 28, 2007}}, publisher, official site</ref> and began to develop a grass roots following.\n\nIt was the death of Maranville in 2000 that caused her to move back to the northeastern United States and enter a period of personal reflection: \"I wrote this last project [''My Remembrance of You''] in a cabin in the woods, trying to recover my balance after the loss of my grandfather. I was writing songs because I had to, for myself.\"<ref name = \"Dispatch\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAlthough widely recognized as an \"emerging artist\" in 2006, Jones's recording and songwriting career began a decade earlier.  Her 1997 debut, ''Imagine Me'', has been described as a combination of \"the traditional American folk genre with a cutting edge on modern female folk music.\"<ref name = \"FAME97\">Julie Block, \"Review: ''Imagine Me''\", edited by Shawn Linderman, [http://www.acousticmusic.com/pfms/ Peterborough Folk Music Society] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206091420/http://www.acousticmusic.com/pfms/ |date=February 6, 2007 }}/[http://www.acousticmusic.com/frames/fame.htm Folk and Acoustic Music Exchange], 1997</ref>\nTwo years later, Jones followed-up with ''The One That Got Away''.\n\nJones really caught the attention of folk music fans when she re-emerged with ''My Remembrance of You''.  The album was released March 12, 2006.  It was dedicated to her late grandfather while also paying tribute to producer and archivist [[Alan Lomax]].<ref name = \"Dispatch\"/>\n\nThe recording almost immediately received high praise from critics.<ref name = \"Tribune\"/><ref name = \"FAME06\">Sonny Thomas, \"Review: ''My Remembrance of You''\", edited by David N.

Other musicians include [[Duke Levine]] on strings, [[Bob Dick]] on bass, [[Lorne Entress]] on percussion, and [[Jay Ungar]] on fiddle.\n\nPerhaps the most noted track in the collection is \"Pony\", a song told from the viewpoint of a young Native American girl in the 1920s who is forced to assimilate to a life and culture that is not her own.\n\n\"Pony\" features [[Ferron]] on backing vocals. In addition to being nominated for a \"Song of the Year\" award by the [[North American Folk Alliance]], the song finished the year at number 15 in the 2006 year-end Folk Radio Airplay Chart.<ref name = \"FDJ-L\">[http://folkradio.org/06topsongs.html Top Folk Songs of 2006] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070923124909/http://www.folkradio.org/06topsongs.html |date=September 23, 2007}} by FolkDJ-L DJs, compiled by Richard Gillmann</ref>\n\nIn 2007 Jones produced an album of songs written and performed with [[North Carolina]]-based songwriter [[Jonathan Byrd (musician)|Jonathan Byrd]].  ''[[Radio Soul]]''  is a stripped down recording featuring the voices and guitars of the two songwriters with little added instrumentation.\n\nIn September 2008, [[Joan Baez]] released a recording of Jones's \"Henry Russell's Last Words\" on her album ''[[Day After Tomorrow (Joan Baez album)|Day After Tomorrow]]''. Baez' album has since been nominated for a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]].\n\nIn 2009, Jones released \"Better Times Will Come\" on Proper Records which included \"Henry Russell's Last Words,\" \"Cracked and Broken,\" and \"The Day I Die.\" Nanci Griffith sang back up on the title track.\n\nHigh Atmosphere (Proper) was released in 2011.\n\nMuseum of Appalachia Recordings was recorded at Peters Homestead Cabin, Museum of Appalachia, in Clinton, Tennessee in December 2012, and released in November 2013. Recorded live with two session musicians, the record was inspired by the love of old-time Appalachian music Jones's grandfather passed on to her.\n\nJones is frequently compared to other distinct voices in [[Americana music]] such as [[Gillian Welch]], [[Iris DeMent]], and [[Alison Krauss]].<ref name = \"Tribune\"/> Jones states that she is flattered by the comparisons and if asked to add a name to the list suggests \"[[Ginny Hawker]] would be the name I would add. She has one of the truest voices I have heard. I love everything about the way she sings a song.\"<ref name = \"Dispatch\"/>\n\nJones has shared the stage with many artists, including Janis Ian, Steve Earle, Martina McBride, Nanci Griffith, Richard Thompson, John Gorka, Mary Gauthier, Old Crow Medicine Show, Guy Clark, and many others.\n\n== Discography ==\n* ''Imagine Me'' (1997, New Shoes Records)\n* ''[[The One That Got Away (Diana Jones album)|The One That Got Away]]'' (1998, New Shoes Records)\n* ''[[My Remembrance of You]]'' (2006, NewSong Recordings)\n* ''[[Radio Soul]]'', with [[Jonathan Byrd (musician)|Jonathan Byrd]] (May 2007)\n* ''Better Times Will Come'' (February 2009, [[Proper Records]] [UK]/ April 2009 [US])\n* ''High Atmosphere'' (April 5, 2011, USA)\n* ''Museum Of Appalachia Recordings'' (July 8, 2013 Proper Records [UK]/ November 5, 2013 Goldmine Records USA)\n* ''Song to a Refugee'' (September 25, 2020, [[Proper Records]])\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.dianajonesmusic.com/ Diana Jones], official web site\n* [http://www.myspace.com/dianajonesmusic  Diana Jones] at [[MySpace]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jones, Diana}}\n[[Category:American women country singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American women singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American folk singers]]\n[[Category:Sarah Lawrence College alumni]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Proper Records artists]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:21st-century American women singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Tennessee]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

Lightfoot also recorded in the [[Nashville, Tennessee]] area at [[Bradley's Barn|Forest Hills Music Studio (\"Bradley's Barn\")]] run by [[Owen Bradley]] and his son [[Jerry Bradley (music executive)|Jerry]] during the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/jerry-bradley |access-date=May 2, 2023 |title=Jerry Bradley |website=Country Music Hall of Fame |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220816221321/https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/jerry-bradley |archive-date=August 16, 2022}}</ref>\n\nTo kick off Canada's [[Canadian Centennial|Centennial]] year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] commissioned Lightfoot to write the \"[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]\" for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967.  Between 1966 and 1969, Lightfoot recorded four additional albums for United Artists: ''[[The Way I Feel (Gordon Lightfoot album)|The Way I Feel]]'' (1967), ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'' (1968), ''[[Back Here on Earth]]'' (1968), and the live recording ''[[Sunday Concert]]'' (1969), and consistently placed singles in the Canadian top 40, including \"Go-Go Round\", \"Spin, Spin\", and \"The Way I Feel\". His biggest hit of the era was a rendition of Bob Dylan's \"[[Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the Canadian charts in December 1965. ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'', released in January 1968, featured \"Black Day in July\", about the 1967 Detroit riot. Weeks later, upon the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] on April 4, radio stations in 30 states pulled the song for \"fanning the flames\", even though the song was a plea for racial harmony.  Lightfoot stated at the time radio station owners cared more about playing songs \"that make people happy\" and not those \"that make people think.\"  Unhappy at a lack of support from United Artists, he defected to [[Warner Bros. Records]], scoring his first major international hit in early 1971 with \"If You Could Read My Mind\".\n\nLightfoot's albums from this time were well received abroad but did not produce any hit singles. Outside of Canada, he remained better known as a songwriter than as a performer, yet he was to find commercial success there before he was fully appreciated in his own country.<ref name=\"Edwardson2009\">{{cite book |last1=Edwardson |first1=Ryan |title=Canuck Rock: A History of Canadian Popular Music |date=2009 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0-8020-9989-1 |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwc4o2qntH4C&pg=PA165}}</ref><ref name=\"Marsh1999\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Marsh |editor1-first=James H. |title=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=1999 |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |isbn=978-0-7710-2099-5 |pages=1865\u20131866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wR_-aSFyvuYC&pg=PA1865}}</ref>\n\nHis success as a live performer continued to grow throughout the late 1960s. He embarked on his first Canadian national tour in 1967, and also performed in New York City. Between 1967 and 1974, Lightfoot toured Europe and was well-received on two tours of Australia.\n\nUA continued to release \"Best of\" album compilations in the 1970s even after Lightfoot became a success at Warner Bros./Reprise.\n\n===1970s===\nLightfoot signed to Warner Bros./Reprise in 1970 and scored a major hit in the United States with \"[[If You Could Read My Mind]]\", which sold over one million copies by early 1971 and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= 282\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/282\n}}</ref> The song had originally appeared on the poorly-selling 1970 album ''[[Sit Down Young Stranger]].'' After the song's success, the album was reissued under the new title ''If You Could Read My Mind;'' it reached No.&nbsp;5 nationally and represented a major turning point in Lightfoot's career.<ref name=\"BBC\" /> The album also featured a second recorded version of \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\", as well as \"The Pony Man\", \"Your Love's Return (Song for Stephen Foster)\", and \"Minstrel of the Dawn\".\n\nOver the next seven years, he recorded a series of successful albums that established him as a singer-songwriter:\n* ''[[Summer Side of Life]]'' (1971), with songs \"Ten Degrees and Getting Colder\", \"Miguel\", \"Cabaret\", \"Nous Vivons Ensemble\", and the title track\n* ''[[Don Quixote (album)|Don Quixote]]'' (1972), with \"[[Beautiful_(Gordon_Lightfoot_song)|Beautiful]]\", \"Looking at the Rain\", \"Christian Island (Georgian Bay)\", and the title track\n* ''[[Old Dan's Records]]'' (1972), with the title track, the two-sided single \"That Same Old Obsession\"/\"You Are What I Am\", and the songs \"It's Worth Believin'\" and \"Can't Depend on Love\"\n* ''[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Sundown]]'' (1974).

The affliction curtailed his touring schedule but Lightfoot nevertheless continued to deliver major hits: in June 1974 his classic single \"[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]\" from the album ''Sundown'' went to [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1974|No.1]] on the American and Canadian charts. It would be his only number one hit in the United States. He performed it twice on NBC's ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' series. \"Carefree Highway\" (about [[Arizona State Route 74]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]) was the follow-up single from the same album.

The lyrics in his song, \"[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald|The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']]\", released the following year, were substantially based on facts in the article. It reached number two on the United States ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart and was a number one hit in Canada. Lightfoot appeared at several 25th anniversary memorial services of the sinking, and stayed in personal contact with the family members of the men who perished in the ''Edmund Fitzgerald.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssedmundfitzgerald.org/gordon-lightfoot-song/|title=\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" by Gordon Lightfoot|publisher=S S Edmund Fitzgerald Online|access-date=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Lightfoot had another top 40 hit on the United States Hot 100, a re-recorded version of \"The Circle Is Small (I Can See It in Your Eyes),\" which reached number 33.\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nDuring the 1980s and the 1990s, Lightfoot recorded six more original albums and a compilation for Warner Bros./Reprise: ''[[Dream Street Rose]]'' (1980), ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' (1982), ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' (1983), ''[[East of Midnight]]'' (1986), another compilation ''[[Gord's Gold Volume II]]'' (1988), ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993), and ''[[A Painter Passing Through]]'' (1998).\n\nThe album ''Dream Street Rose'' has the folk-pop sound that Lightfoot established during the previous decade. In addition to the title song, it includes songs such as \"Ghosts of Cape Horn\" and \"On the High Seas\". It also includes the [[Leroy Van Dyke]] 1950s composition \"The Auctioneer\", a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-like number that was a concert staple for Lightfoot from the mid-1960s to the 1980s. The album ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' represents a departure from the acoustic sound of his guitar playing in the 1970s and introduces an adult-contemporary sound. Songs like \"Shadows\" and \"Thank You for the Promises\" contain an underlying sadness and resignation. The 1982 American released single \"Baby Step Back\" marked his last time in the top 50 in that country.\nThe 1983 album ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' produced no hit singles; the 1986 ''East of Midnight'' album had several [[Adult Contemporary]] songs like \"A Passing Ship\", \"Morning Glory\", and \"I'll Tag Along\" (East of Midnight). A single from ''East of Midnight'', \"Anything for Love\", made the 1986 Billboard Country and Western chart.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSQEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22Anything+for+Love%22+billboard+country+and+western+chart&pg=PA35|title=Anything for Love; Billboard|date=October 18, 1986|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1987, Lightfoot filed a lawsuit against composer [[Michael Masser]], claiming that Masser's melody for the song \"The Greatest Love of All\", versions of which were recorded and released by [[George Benson]] in 1977 and [[Whitney Houston]] in 1985, had stolen 24 bars from Lightfoot's 1971 hit song \"If You Could Read My Mind\". The transitional section that begins \"I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow\" of the Masser song has the same melody as \"I never thought I could feel this way and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back\" of Lightfoot's song. Lightfoot later stated that he did not want people thinking that he had stolen his melody from Masser.<ref>{{cite web|author=Florian BODENSEHER |url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/biography.htm |title=Gordon Lightfoot \u2013 Biography |website=Corfid.com |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> The case was settled out of court and Masser issued a public apology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storyofsongs.blogspot.com/2009/08/greatest-love.html |title=Greatest Love |date=August 29, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref> Lightfoot rounded out the decade with his follow-up compilation ''[[Gord's Gold Volume II]],'' in late 1988, which contained re-recorded versions of his most popular songs, including a re-make of the 1970 song \"The Pony Man\". The original had been brisk in pace, acoustic, and about three minutes long. This new version was slower, clocking in at four minutes plus. Lightfoot performed with Canadian singer-songwriter [[Ian Tyson]] at the opening ceremonies of the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Lightfoot returned to his acoustic roots and recorded two albums. ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993) includes songs such as \"Restless\", \"Wild Strawberries\", and Bob Dylan's \"Ring Them Bells\".  1998's ''A Painter Passing Through'' reintroduced a sound more reminiscent of his early recordings,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chrispell|first=James|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-pH4i3jXvAC&q=With+the+release+of+A+Painter+Passing+Through%2C+Lightfoot+appears+to+have+found+home+and+has+turned+in+his+best+work+in+years.+Gone+are+the+uncertain+arrangements+of+the+past%3B+in+their+place%2C+there+is+a+welcome+return+to+the+essence+of+the+%22Sundown%22+musical+era.&pg=PA654|title=All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2002|isbn=9780879306533|editor-last=Bogdanov|editor-first=Vladimir|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=654|chapter=A Painter Passing Through / May 12, 1998 / Reprise|editor-last2=Woodstra|editor-first2=Chris|editor-last3=Erlewine|editor-first3=Stephen Thomas}}</ref> with songs like \"Much to My Surprise\", \"Red Velvet\", \"Drifters\", and \"I Used to Be a Country Singer\".

PBS stations offered a videotape of the concert as a pledge gift, and a tape and DVD were released in 2001 in Europe and North America. This was the first Lightfoot concert video released. In April 2001, Lightfoot performed at the Tin Pan South Legends concert at [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville, closing the show.  In May, he performed \"Ring Them Bells\" at [[Massey Hall]] in honour of Bob Dylan's 60th birthday.\n\nBy January 2002, Lightfoot had written 30 new songs for his next studio album. He recorded guitar and vocal demos of some of these new songs. In September, before the second concert of a two-night stand in [[Orillia]], Lightfoot suffered severe stomach pain and was airlifted to [[McMaster University Medical Centre]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. He underwent emergency [[vascular surgery]] for a ruptured [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/gordon-lightfoot-is-happy-to-be-all-live|title=Gordon Lightfoot is happy to be All Live|date=April 27, 2012|newspaper=National Post|access-date=September 20, 2018|last1=Kaplan|first1=Ben}}</ref> and he remained in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

More than three months after being taken to the McMaster Medical Centre, Lightfoot was released in December to continue his recovery at home.\n\nIn 2003, Lightfoot underwent follow-up surgery to continue the treatment of his abdominal condition. In November he signed a new recording contract with [[Linus Entertainment]] and began rehearsing with his band for the first time since his illness.  Also in 2003, [[Borealis Records]], a label related to Linus Entertainment, released ''Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot''.  On this album, various artists, including The [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[Jesse Winchester]], [[Maria Muldaur]], and [[The Tragically Hip]] interpreted Lightfoot's songs. The final track on the album, \"Lightfoot\", was the only song not previously released by Lightfoot. It was composed and performed by [[Aengus Finnan]].\n\nIn January 2004, Lightfoot completed work on his album ''[[Harmony (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Harmony]]'', which he had mostly recorded prior to his illness. The album was released on his new home label of Linus Records on May 11 of that year.  It was his 20th original album and included a single and new video for \"Inspiration Lady\". Other songs on the album are \"Clouds of Loneliness\", \"Sometimes I Wish\", \"Flyin' Blind\", and \"No Mistake About It\". The album also contains the upbeat yet reflective track called \"End of All Time\" In July 2004, he made a surprise comeback performance, his first since falling ill, at Mariposa in Orillia, performing \"I'll Tag Along\" solo. In August he performed a five-song solo set in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], Ontario, at a flood relief benefit. In November he made his long-awaited return to the concert stage with two sold-out benefit shows in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Lightfoot returned to the music business with his new album selling well and an appearance on ''[[Canadian Idol]]'', where the six top contestants each performed a song of his, culminating in a group performance \u2013 on their own instruments \u2013 of his ''[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]''. In 2005, he made a low-key tour called the ''Better Late Than Never Tour''.\n\nOn September 14, 2006, while in the middle of a performance, Lightfoot suffered a minor stroke that temporarily left him without the use of the middle and ring fingers on his right hand.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/gordon-lightfoot-dead-1.6828991 |title=Canadian folk music icon Gordon Lightfoot dead at 84 |author=Susan Noakes |date=May 1, 2023 |website=cbc.ca |access-date=May 1, 2023}}</ref> He returned to performing nine days later and for a brief time used a substitute guitarist for more difficult guitar work.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/lightfoot |title=Music: Stroke doesn't diminish Lightfoots skills as an entertainer |date=September 25, 2006 |website=Onmilwaukee.com |access-date=May 1, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Denis Armstrong |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Lightfoot_Gordon/ConcertReviews/2006/11/12/2326377.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710212859/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/L/Lightfoot_Gordon/ConcertReviews/2006/11/12/2326377.html |url-status=usurped |archive-date=July 10, 2012 |title=CANOE \u2013 JAM!

His first marriage in April 1963 was to Brita Ingegerd Olaisson, a Swede, with whom he had two children, Fred and Ingrid. They divorced in 1973, the marriage ending in part because of his infidelity. Lightfoot acknowledged that his musical touring and the fact that he found fidelity difficult in a long-distance relationship contributed to the failure of at least two relationships.\n\nThe song \"[[If You Could Read My Mind]]\" was written in reflection upon his disintegrating marriage. At the request of his daughter, Ingrid, he performed the lyrics with a slight change: the line \"I'm just trying to understand the feelings that you lack\" is altered to \"I'm just trying to understand the feelings that ''we'' lack.\" He said in an interview that the difficulty with writing songs inspired by personal stories is that there is not always the emotional distance and clarity to make lyrical improvements such as the one his daughter suggested.\n\nLightfoot was single for 16 years and had two other children from relationships between his first and second marriages: Gaylen McGee and Eric Lightfoot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corfid.com/vbb/archive/index.php/t-15235.html |title=Gord's eldest children |website=Gordon Lightfoot Forums |access-date=December 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, Lightfoot was involved with [[Cathy Smith]]; their volatile relationship inspired his songs \"[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]\" and \"[[Rainy Day People]]\" among others. \"Cathy was a great lady,\" Lightfoot told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' after her death. \"Men were drawn to her, and she used to make me jealous.

When he was successful in persuading a school, college, American Legion hall, or coffeehouse to let him play, Denver distributed posters in the town and usually showed up at the local radio station, guitar in hand, offering himself for an interview.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newmexicomusic.org/2015/11/25/denver-john/ |title=Denver, John |publisher=New Mexico Music Commission |access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref> As the writer of \"[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]\", Denver was often successful in gaining some promotional airtime, usually performing one or two songs live.

Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer [[Jerry Weintraub]], who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a reissue of the track and began a radio airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver's career flourished thereafter, and he had a series of hits over the next four years.

People forget how huge he was worldwide.\"\n\nIn 1977, Denver co-founded [[The Hunger Project]] with [[Werner Erhard]] and [[Robert W. Fuller]]. He served for many years and supported the organization until his death. President [[Jimmy Carter]] appointed Denver to serve on the President's Commission on World Hunger. Denver wrote the song \"I Want to Live\" as the commission's theme song. In 1979, Denver performed \"Rhymes & Reasons\" at the [[Music for UNICEF Concert]].

In 1976, Denver campaigned for [[Jimmy Carter]], who became a close friend and ally. Denver was a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and of a number of charitable causes for the environmental movement, the homeless, the poor, the hungry, and the [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|African AIDS crisis]]. He founded the charitable [[Windstar Foundation]] in 1976 to promote [[sustainable living]].

In an open letter to the media, Denver wrote that he opposed oil drilling in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]]. He had battled to expand the refuge in the 1980s, and he praised President [[Bill Clinton]] for his opposition to the proposed drilling.

He made public expression of his acquaintances and friendships with ecological design researchers such as [[Buckminster Fuller|Richard Buckminster Fuller]] (about whom he wrote and composed \"What One Man Can Do\") and [[Amory Lovins]], from whom he said he learned much. Denver also founded the environmental group Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000). He also had a keen interest in solutions to world hunger and visited Africa during the 1980s to witness firsthand the suffering caused by starvation and work with African leaders toward solutions.\n\nFrom 1973 to at least 1979, Denver annually performed at the fundraising picnic for the Aspen Camp School for the Deaf, raising half of the camp's annual operating budget.<ref name=\"barb1\">{{cite news |last1=Isenberg |first1=Barbara |title=Aspen Takes a Mellow Stance Towards John Denver's Gas Tank |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/493749518/? |access-date=December 18, 2018 |work=The Record |agency=Los Angeles Times News Service |date=August 20, 1979}}</ref> During the Aspen Valley Hospital's $1.7&nbsp;million capital campaign in 1979, Denver was the largest single donor.<ref name=\"barb1\" />\n\nIn 1983 and 1984, Denver hosted the annual Grammy Awards, which he had previously done in 1977, 1978, and 1979.

The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately before the final flight. His newly purchased amateur-built Rutan aircraft had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration. The handle had originally been intended by the plane's designer to be between the pilot's legs. The builder instead put it behind the pilot's left shoulder. The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilot's seat and was not visible to the person at the controls.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" /> An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" />\n\nBefore the flight, Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle using a pair of [[Locking pliers|Vise-Grip pliers]], but this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB officials' post-accident investigation showed that because of the fuel selector valve\u2019s positioning, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] (nose right) and pitch up.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" />\n\nThe mechanic said that he told Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver that there was \"less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank\". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered from the wreckage. Denver said that he would use the autopilot in flight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel the aircraft, saying that he would only be flying for about an hour.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" />\n\nThe NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denver's last flight. Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinos.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" /> Four said the aircraft was originally heading west. Five said that they saw the plane in a steep bank, with four saying that the bank was to the right (north). Twelve described seeing the aircraft in a steep nose-down descent. Witnesses estimated the plane's altitude between {{convert|350 and 500|ft}} when heading toward the shoreline. Eight said they heard a \"pop\" or \"backfire\" accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the plane crashed into the sea.\n\nIn addition to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined other key factors that led to the accident. Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builder's decision to put the fuel selector handle in a hard-to-reach place.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" /> The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating home-built aircraft. It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:JohnDenverMemorialPacificGrove.JPG|thumb|The plaque marking the location of Denver's plane crash in [[Pacific Grove, California]]]]\nUpon the announcement of Denver's death, Colorado Governor [[Roy Romer]] ordered all state flags to be lowered to [[half-mast|half-staff]] in his honor.

Permission was finally granted in 1999, but the project was put on hold at the request of Denver's family.

The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in [[Greenwich Village]].\n\nInitially, Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanac Singers termed \"peace\" songs while the Nazi\u2013Soviet Pact was in effect. After Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, the group wrote anti-fascist songs. The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians, though the core members included Guthrie, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Millard Lampell]] and [[Lee Hays]]. In keeping with common utopian ideals, meals, chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared. The Sunday hootenannies were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent. Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits among all the members, although in the case of \"[[Union Maid]]\", members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song, ensuring that his children would receive residuals.<ref>{{cite book|page=220|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

They had a child, Lorina Lynn. The couple moved to [[Fruit Cove, Florida]], where they briefly lived. They lived in a bus on land called [[Beluthahatchee]], owned by his friend [[Stetson Kennedy]]. Guthrie's arm was hurt in an accident when gasoline used to start the campfire exploded. Although he regained movement in the arm, he was never able to play the guitar again. In 1954, the couple returned to New York,<ref>Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&nbsp;418\u201319.</ref> living in the Beach Haven apartment complex owned and operated by [[Fred Trump]] in [[Gravesend, Brooklyn]]; Guthrie composed there the song \"[[Old Man Trump]]\".

Will Kauffman says,\n{{Blockquote|  As he once claimed: \"If you call me a Communist, I am very proud because it takes a wise and hard-working\n person to be a Communist\" (qtd. in Klein 303). Klein also says that Guthrie applied to join the Communist Party, but his application was turned down. In later years, he'd say, \"I'm not a Communist, but I've been in the red all my life.\" He took great delight in proclaiming his hopes for a communist victory in the Korean War and more than once expressed his admiration for Stalin. Unlike his musical prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Pete Seeger, Guthrie never offered any regret for his Stalinism.<ref name=Kaufman2010/>}}\n\nThe matter of Guthrie's membership, however, remains controversial.

Guthrie wrote numerous Jewish lyrics which can be linked to his close collaborative relationship with Aliza Greenblatt who lived near Guthrie and his family in Brooklyn in the 1940s. Guthrie, the Oklahoma troubadour, and Greenblatt, the Jewish wordsmith, often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other's works, finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice. Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn, where Jewish culture was interwoven with music, modern dance, poetry and anti-fascist, pro-labor, socialist activism. Guthrie was inspired to write songs that arose from this unlikely relationship; he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples.\n\nThese lyrics were rediscovered by [[Nora Guthrie]] and were set to music by the Jewish Klezmer group [[The Klezmatics]] with the release of ''Happy Joyous Hanukkah'' on JMG Records in 2007.

He was the original bassist of [[the Byrds]]. With frequent collaborator [[Gram Parsons]], Hillman was a key figure in the development of [[country rock]], defining the genre through his work with the Byrds, [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]] and the country-rock group [[the Desert Rose Band]]. He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991 as a member of the Byrds.\n\n==Early life==\nHillman was born in Los Angeles, California, the third of four children.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guitarist Chris Hillman|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|url=https://www.loc.gov/today/cyberlc/feature_wdesc.php?rec=4766|access-date=2015-12-10}}</ref> He spent his early years at his family's ranch home in rural northern [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]], approximately {{convert|110|mi}} from Los Angeles. He has credited his older sister with exciting his interest in [[Country music|country]] and [[folk music]], when she returned from college during the late 1950s with folk music records by [[The New Lost City Ramblers]] and others. Hillman soon began watching many of the country-music shows on local television in southern California at the time such as ''Town Hall Party'', ''The [[Spade Cooley]] Show'' and ''Cal's Corral''. Hillman's mother encouraged his musical interests and bought him his first guitar; shortly thereafter he developed an interest in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], particularly the [[mandolin]]. At the age of 15, Hillman went to Los Angeles to see the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|Kentucky Colonels]] bluegrass band at the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]], and later convinced his family to allow him to travel by train to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] for lessons from mandolinist Scott Hambly. When Chris was 16, his father committed suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/interviews/CW98_chris_hillman.aspx |title=Chris Hillman: 'Turn, Turn, Turn' |website=Cbn.com |access-date=2015-12-10}}</ref>\n\nHillman became known in San Diego's folk music community as a solid player; this won him an invitation to join his first band, the [[Scottsville Squirrel Barkers]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The band lasted barely two years, recording only one album (''Blue Grass Favorites'', which was distributed in supermarkets); however, it has a posthumous reputation as the spawning ground for a number of musicians who went on to play in [[the Eagles]], the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Byrds, [[Hearts & Flowers]], and the [[Country Gazette (band)|Country Gazette]]. When the band broke up in late 1963 Hillman received an invitation to join the Golden State Boys, regarded as the top bluegrass band in [[southern California]] and featuring future country star [[Vern Gosdin]], his brother Rex and banjoist [[Don Parmley]] (later of the [[Bluegrass Cardinals]]). Shortly thereafter the band changed its name to [[The Hillmen]];<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> soon Hillman was appearing regularly on television and using a fictitious ID, \"Chris Hardin\", to allow the underage musician into the country bars where many of his gigs were played. When the Hillmen folded, he briefly joined a spinoff of Randy Sparks' [[The New Christy Minstrels|New Christy Minstrels]] known as the Green Grass Revival.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== The Byrds (1964\u20131968) ===\n{{main|The Byrds}}\n[[File:The Byrds 1965.png|thumb|Hillman (far left) as a member of the Byrds in 1965]]\nAt this point a frustrated Hillman considered quitting music and enrolling at [[UCLA]] when he received an offer from The Hillmen's former manager and producer, Jim Dickson, to join Jim (later Roger) McGuinn, David Crosby, Gene Clark and Michael Clarke in a new band, The Byrds.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Hillman was recruited to play bass guitar, although he had never picked up the instrument. Thanks to his bluegrass background, he quickly developed his own melodic style on the instrument. The Byrds' first single, a jangly cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\", was an international hit and marked the birth of [[folk rock]]. During the mid-1960s the Byrds ranked as one of the most successful and influential American pop groups; they recorded a string of hits, including \"[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]\", \"[[Eight Miles High]]\" and \"[[So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star]]\".\n\nHillman kept a low profile on the band's first two albums, on which McGuinn and Clark shared lead vocals with Crosby adding high harmony and singing the bridge on \"[[All I Really Want to Do]]\". However, Clark's departure in 1966 and Crosby's growing restlessness allowed Hillman the opportunity to develop as a singer and songwriter in the group. He came into his own on the Byrds' 1967 album ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'', co-writing and sharing lead vocals with McGuinn on the hit \"[[So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Hillman also wrote (and sang) the minor hit \"[[Have You Seen Her Face]]\", \"Thoughts and Words\", \"Time Between\" and \"The Girl with No Name\", the latter two demonstrating his bluegrass and country roots. Hillman's prominence continued with the Byrds' next album, ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'', on which he shared songwriting credit on seven of the album's eleven songs.\n\n=== Pioneering country rock ===\nInternal strife dogged the Byrds, and by the beginning of 1968 the band was down to two original members (Hillman and McGuinn), with Hillman's cousin [[Kevin Kelley (musician)|Kevin Kelley]] on drums. They then hired [[Gram Parsons]] to replace Crosby. Hillman, who had brought country music into the Byrds' earliest recording of \"Satisfied Mind\", found another lover of country music in Parsons.  ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'' was recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and continues to inspire musicians in the Americana format.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Parsons left the band shortly thereafter; Hillman brought in former Kentucky Colonels guitarist [[Clarence White]] as a replacement and White suggested that the group replace Kelley with [[Gene Parsons]] (no relation to Gram) on drums, but this line-up was short-lived and Hillman himself left the Byrds due to financial misappropriation by their management.\n\n=== The Flying Burrito Brothers (1969\u20131972) ===\n{{Main article|The Flying Burrito Brothers}}\n[[File:FlyingBurritos1970.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] (Amsterdam, 1970). From left to right: [[Pete Kleinow|'Sneaky' Pete Kleinow]], [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], Chris Hillman, [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] & [[Bernie Leadon]] ]]\n\nHillman teamed with Gram Parsons again (this time as vocalist, guitarist and songwriter) to form the [[Flying Burrito Brothers]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Further honing their pioneering country-rock hybrid sound by combining the energy, instrumentation and attitude of [[rock and roll]] with the issues and themes of [[country music]], the Burritos recorded the landmark ''[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]'' (1969) followed by 1970's ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]''. Parsons was fired from the line-up by June 1970 (replaced by guitarist [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]]) when the band toured Canada as part of the [[Festival Express]] tour, with Hillman reverting to bass guitar. Hillman stayed with the band for two more records, ''[[The Flying Burrito Bros (album)|The Flying Burrito Brothers]]'' and ''[[Last of the Red Hot Burritos]]''.\n\n=== Various bands and solo career (1970s) ===\n{{Main article|Manassas (band)|Souther-Hillman-Furay Band|McGuinn, Clark & Hillman}}\nBefore the Flying Burrito Brothers disbanded, Hillman joined [[Stephen Stills]]' band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> They released two albums, a 1972 [[Manassas (album)|self-titled double album]], and a 1973 album ''[[Down the Road (Manassas album)|Down the Road]]''. Led by Stills, Manassas was an exploration into a mixture of rock, country, blues, bluegrass and Latin music. In 1972, Stills gave Hillman a 1924 [[Lloyd Loar]] [[Gibson F-5]] mandolin.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lewis |first=Randy |date=2017-09-18 |title=Byrds co-founder Chris Hillman taps David Crosby, Roger McGuinn, Tom Petty for new solo album |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-chris-hillman-bidin-my-time-tom-petty-20170810-story.html |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-09-18 |title=Chris Hillman |url=https://www.latimes.com/94338813-132.html |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> Hillman remained with Manassas until 1973, when he briefly re-joined the original line-up of the Byrds for a reunion album on [[Asylum Records]].\n\nIn 1974, Hillman teamed with singer-songwriter [[Richie Furay]] (who co-founded [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Poco (band)|Poco]]) and songwriter [[JD Souther]] (who co-wrote much of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' early repertoire) in the [[Souther-Hillman-Furay Band]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> The trio never quite gelled, and broke up in 1975 after two albums and internal squabbles.\n\nHillman released two solo albums, ''Slippin' Away'' and ''Clear Sailin''',<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which included several songs co-written with ''[[Crawdaddy!|Crawdaddy]]'' magazine editor [[Peter Knobler]]. One of their songs, \"Step on Out,\" was recorded by [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] on their 1985 album and became the title cut. He was also an in-demand studio musician, playing and singing on sessions for [[Gene Clark]], [[Dillard & Clark]], [[Poco (band)|Poco]], [[Dan Fogelberg]] and others. After an early 1977 UK tour reunited him with [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[Gene Clark]], the trio stayed together as [[McGuinn, Clark & Hillman]] for two albums<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> (on which Hillman continued his songwriting collaboration with Knobler) and one under the McGuinn-Hillman name, with a hit single in 1979's \"Don't You Write Her Off\".\n\n=== The Desert Rose Band (1985\u20131994, 2008) ===\n{{Main article|The Desert Rose Band}}\nBy the early 1980s Hillman had returned to his bluegrass and country roots, recording two acclaimed (mainly acoustic) albums for [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] with singer/guitarist/banjo player [[Herb Pedersen]] (a former member of [[The Dillards]]). Soon after, Hillman and Pedersen formed the [[Desert Rose Band]];<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> this proved to be Hillman's most commercially successful post-Byrds project. Their self-titled debut album in 1987 generated two [[Record chart|Top Ten]] country hits in \"Love Reunited\" (written with Steve Hill), \"One Step Forward\" and the number-one single \"He's Back and I'm Blue.\" From 1987 until late 1993 the band recorded five albums and one Greatest Hits package and had a string of 16 country-music [[Billboard magazine|hits]] (the majority of which were in the country Top Ten) and a number of [[Academy of Country Music]] awards before disbanding in 1994. As Hillman said, \"We definitely quit while we were ahead.\"\n\nChris Hillman, Herb Pedersen, JayDee Maness, John Jorgenson, Bill Bryson, and Steve Duncan performed their first reunion concert on August 27, 2008  in Solana Beach, CA. Before this date Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen were as a duo joined by John Jorgenson on May 2, 2008 for a small DRB set at the [[Station Inn]] in Nashville. This six-man lineup is the best known, and includes all of the original members present on the hit albums from the 1980s. At this show, Hillman said it was the first time they had played together in 19 years. They went through a string of DRB hits but were unable to play \"He's Back and I'm Blue\" because Hillman said he had forgotten the words. This sold-out show prompted Hillman and the band to play a handful of other reunion shows at  music festivals throughout the U.S. Several of these were recorded for inclusion on a live album, which Hillman hopes to release in the U.S. and Europe. If released, this will be the Desert Rose Band's only live album.\n\n=== 1990s and beyond ===\n[[File:ChrisHillman.jpg|thumb|Hillman in 2004]]\nAt the peak of the Desert Rose Band's success, Hillman began appearing infrequently with McGuinn. A duet recorded by the pair for the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]'s ''[[Will The Circle Be Unbroken Vol. II]]'' album, \"You Ain't Going Nowhere\", reached the Country Top 10 in 1989. Soon the pair joined Crosby in a reformed Byrds, playing a handful of club dates. In 1990 they appeared at a tribute to [[Roy Orbison]], performing \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" with the song's composer [[Bob Dylan]]. That same year the Byrds cut four new songs for inclusion in a career-spanning box set, and in 1991 they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 1996 Hillman reunited with Desert Rose Band alumnus Herb Pederson for the CD ''Bakersfield Bound''. ''Like a Hurricane'' (1998) and three bluegrass-flavored releases on [[Rounder Records]] with Pedersen, [[Larry Rice (musician)|Larry Rice]], and [[Tony Rice]] followed. He appeared on the 1999 album ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'' in a duet with [[Steve Earle]] on \"High Fashion Queen\" (which Hillman wrote with Parsons).\n\nAfter a brief hiatus Hillman and Pedersen returned with ''Way Out West'' (2002), a 17-track collection of country, [[roots rock]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]]; this was followed by ''The Other Side'' (2005). In 2010 he recorded \"Live at Edwards Barn\" with Herb Pedersen for Rounder Records.\n\nHillman has continued to write, perform and tour, with dates in 2017 with Herb Pedersen and John Jorgenson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chrishillman.com/calendar.html |title=Tour Dates |publisher=Chris Hillman |access-date=2017-10-07}}</ref>  He released his latest album, ''Bidin' My Time'' (2017), co-produced with [[Tom Petty]], featuring guests including Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and members of The Heartbreakers.

Since 2018, the band has consisted of [[Jeff Hanna]] and his son Jaime Hanna, both guitarists and vocalists, along with Jimmie Fadden (drums, harmonica, vocals), Bob Carpenter (keyboards, accordion, vocals), [[Ross Holmes]] (fiddle, mandolin, vocals), and [[Jim Photoglo]] (bass guitar, vocals).\n\nJeff Hanna and Fadden founded the band in 1966 with a lineup initially consisting of Bruce Kunkel, Ralph Barr, Les Thompson, and [[Jackson Browne]], who quit early on and was replaced by longtime member [[John McEuen]] (vocals, guitar, banjo). The band had its first hit single in 1967 with \"Buy for Me the Rain\" on [[Liberty Records]]. Their earliest work featured [[jug band]] and traditional [[folk music|folk]] elements. In 1970, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band had their biggest pop hit with a cover of [[Jerry Jeff Walker]]'s \"[[Mr. Bojangles (song)|Mr. Bojangles]]\". The band's sound took on elements of [[soft rock]] in the latter half of the 1970s and early 1980s, including the hit singles \"[[An American Dream (song)|An American Dream]]\" and \"Make a Little Magic\".\n\nStarting in 1983, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band began a shift toward [[country music]], led off by the singles \"Shot Full of Love\" and \"[[Dance Little Jean]]\". By this point, the band consisted of Jeff Hanna, McEuen, Fadden, Carpenter, and [[Jimmy Ibbotson]] (bass guitar, vocals). This lineup recorded several country albums for [[Warner Records]] throughout the 1980s and charted multiple singles on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]]. Of these, \"[[Long Hard Road (The Sharecropper's Dream)]]\", \"[[Modern Day Romance]]\", and \"[[Fishin' in the Dark]]\" all went to number one, with the latter becoming their [[signature song]]. After leaving Warner in the late 1980s, Nitty Gritty Dirt Band recorded for several other labels, including [[Universal Records (1988)|Universal]], [[MCA Nashville]], [[Rising Tide Records|Rising Tide]], and [[DreamWorks Records]]. The band has collaborated with a number of artists, including [[Doc Watson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[John Denver]], and [[Steve Martin]]. In addition, Hanna co-wrote [[Rascal Flatts]]'s 2005 single \"[[Bless the Broken Road]]\", which was originally recorded by Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.\n\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band has released three collaborative albums: ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken (album)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]'' (1972), ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken: Volume Two]]'' in 1989, and ''[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken, Volume III]]'' in 2002. All three albums featured a large number of guests from folk, rock, country, and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. They have also won three [[Grammy Awards]]. The band's sound draws influence from country, pop, rock, bluegrass, and folk music, and has seen generally positive critical reception.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Jackson Browne 2017.jpg|150px|thumb|right|Jackson Browne was a founding member of Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.|alt=Musician Jackson Browne, playing an electric guitar and singing into a microphone.]]\nNitty Gritty Dirt Band was founded in [[Long Beach, California]], in 1966.

These were Jimmie Fadden, who at the time played [[washtub bass]], harmonica, and guitar, along with Ralph Barr (guitar, clarinet), Les Thompson (guitar, [[mandolin]]), and [[Jackson Browne]] (guitar).

Colin Larkin, in ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Country Music'', wrote that their early albums contained [[jug band]] and [[Vaudeville]] influences, while by the release of ''Uncle Charlie and His Dog Teddy'', the band \"abandoned the jokey elements...[and] pursued a career as purveyors of superior [[country rock]].\"<ref name=\"virgin\"/> Mark Deming spoke similarly of their early material, noting influences of [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] in the \"Mr. Bojangles\" cover as well as the tracks from the first ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' album. He also defined the band's late-1970s output as [[soft rock]], and that their 1990s and 21st-century material was indebted to [[American folk music]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> On the same site, Stephen Thomas Erlewine also noticed influences of soft rock on ''The Dirt Band''.<ref name=\"erlewine dirt\"/> Rickey Ferguson thought the band's country influences were more evident on ''Plain Dirt Fashion'' due to the use of instruments such as [[Dobro]], [[fiddle]], and [[mandolin]].<ref name=\"rickey\"/> Holly Gleason noted the [[twang]] evident in Hanna's and Ibbotson's singing voices, and thought the band's [[rhythm section]]s were stronger than usual for a country band.<ref name=\"gleason\"/>\n\nDuring the release of ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'', the band members were noted for their long-haired appearance, which at the time was considered counter to the appearances of country music acts at the time. [[Bill Monroe]] was said to have refused an offer to appear on the album, and [[Roy Acuff]] was initially apprehensive before joining.<ref name=\"gone\"/> The band said that an impetus behind their shift to country music in the 1980s was the lack of a successful pop song after \"An American Dream\" and \"Make a Little Magic\", followed by a realization that members of the country music community in Nashville were still fans of their music.<ref name=\"gone\"/> They also thought that the first two ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' projects helped to \"dim the lines\" between pop and country, especially since the genre of [[country rock]] was still new when the first one was recorded.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/212741105/ | title='The Circle' still unbroken | work=The Times | date=October 4, 1989 | accessdate=July 12, 2024 | author=Troy Moon | pages=6C}}</ref> Walter Tunis of the ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]'' thought that the band was an early example of the California-based country rock movement of the 1970s furthered by bands such as [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]] and [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and that such a comparison was furthered when former Eagles member Bernie Leadon joined. He also thought that the band's success in country in the 1980s was more indebted to marketing and changes in taste from listeners more so than a shift in sound within the band itself.

He was left partially [[blindness|blind]] by a misprescribed medication while still an infant.<ref name=\"Miller p. 160\">Miller p. 160</ref> Early on, he exhibited remarkable musical talents and was able to play almost any instrument he picked up, learning completely [[Learning music by ear|by ear]]. Jenkins, who also showed a proficiency for writing songs at a young age, saw his musical abilities as \"a God gift.\"<ref name = \"Georgia\" /><ref>Peterson p. 242-243</ref>\n\nBecause he had some vision, Jenkins could not attend the state's school for the blind and had to pursue an education on his own. Besides his musical talents, he was skilled in other ways. After becoming a Methodist at the age of nine, he began \"preaching\" to playmates from porches and tree stumps.<ref name=\"McNeil p. 204\" /> Not surprisingly, he became a licensed preacher around the age of 21 and moved into the city, supplementing whatever he could earn from preaching and street performing and also by running a newspaper stand.<ref name=\"Peterson p. 24\">Peterson p. 24</ref> After his first wife's death, Jenkins married Francis Jane Walden Eskew in 1919.<ref name=\"McNeil p. 205\">McNeil p. 205</ref> A young widow, his new wife had three musically talented children, Irene, Mary Lee and a son, T.P.<ref name = \"Georgia\" /> Thus was born the Jenkins Family, one of the most popular family acts of its day.<ref name=\"McNeil p. 205\" />\n\n==The Jenkins Family==\nLittle is known about the Jenkins' musical development over their first three years together, but in 1922, they performed their first program on Atlanta radio station [[WSB (AM)|WSB]] with Andrew Jenkins billed as \"the blind newsboy evangelist.\"<ref name = \"Georgia\" /><ref name=\"Kenney p. 149\">Kenney p. 149</ref> The station, which had begun broadcasting just five months before and had a signal that reached coast-to-coast, became known as The Voice of the South.<ref name=\"Miller p. 160\" /> Performing folk, country and light classical material, the Jenkins Family was an immediate success and remained with the station for nearly a decade.<ref name=\"McNeil p. 205\">McNeil p. 205</ref> Their popularity, which reached to Canada and Mexico,<ref name=\"McNeil p. 205\" /> also attracted the attention of a major record label, [[Okeh Records]], for whom they made their debut recordings in 1924<ref name=\"Miller p. 160\">Miller p. 160</ref> (three years before the [[Carter Family]] began recording).<ref name=\"McNeil p. 205\">McNeil p. 205</ref>\n\nThe Jenkins Family's initial releases were not originals,<ref>Laird p. 119</ref> but were successful enough to earn the group another session, where they recorded four of Rev. Jenkins's songs, including two gospel numbers.<ref name=\"McNeil p. 205\" /> Jenkins was soon asked to write songs for the label's other artists, and his first effort, \"The Death of Floyd Collins\", took just 45 minutes to complete.<ref name=\"Miller p. 160\" /> While the song sold poorly for Okeh,<ref name=\"Peterson p. 24\" /> it was picked up by [[Columbia Records]], which hired [[Vernon Dalhart]], one of the era's leading singers, to record it. The Dalhart version eventually sold more than 300,000 copies,<ref name=\"Wolfe p. 191\">Wolfe p. 191</ref> Besides being one of the all-time best-selling country music [[Gramaphone record|78s]],<ref>{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p437369|pure_url=yes}} | last = Kurutz | first = Steve | title = Reverend Andrew Jenkins | publisher = [[Allmusic]] | accessdate = 2009-06-02}}</ref> the song set a sales record for Columbia that stood for many years.\n\n\"The Death of Floyd Collins\" was based on one of the first great media events of the century, the story of a [[Caving|spelunker]] who became trapped in caverns near [[Mammoth Cave]] in Kentucky.<ref name=\"Carlin p. 204\" /><ref name=\"Kenney p. 149\" /> The song was one of a series of \"event\" songs recorded in the mid-20s. The songs told of train wrecks, natural disasters and outlaws, stories often lifted directly from the daily newspapers. The form was not new, and in fact, the music and lyrics owed much to the folk songs of the previous century. The trend did not develop as a natural revival, either. It was devised by the recording companies in response to the drop in sales they were experiencing as the public turned its attention from what had been the latest technological development, records, to an even more alluring medium, radio.<ref>Wolfe p. 188-198</ref>\n\n==Prolific songwriter==\nJenkins proved a master at crafting topical songs from traditional musical and lyrical forms. For example, \"Floyd Collins\" opened with two lines that came directly from an old British ballad:\n\n''Oh, come all you young people''<br />\n''and listen while I tell''<br />\n''The fate of Floyd Collins,<br />\n''a lad we all know well''<ref name=\"Wolfe p. 191\" />\n\nJenkins was adept at more than just ballads, turning out one song after another, as his stepdaughter Irene described it, like a mill grinding wheat.<ref name=\"Kenney p. 149\" /> Many of his topical compositions were recorded by other artists over the ensuing years, including \"[[Billy the Kid]]\", drawn from a popular 1926 biography of the cowboy killer; \"The Wreck of the Royal Palm\", about a two-train collision in Georgia in 1926; \"The Tragedy on Daytona Beach\", based on the 1929 death of race car driver [[Lee Bible]] in Florida; \"The Fate of Frank Dupre\", the story of an Atlanta robbery/murder; and \"Ben Dewberry's Final Run\", which recounted the death of an Atlantan who was the engineer in a 1908 train wreck.<ref name = \"Georgia\" /><ref name=\"McNeil p. 205\">McNeil p. 205</ref><ref name=\"Miller p. 161\">Miller p. 161</ref> In all, he wrote more than 300 non-sacred songs, many of them \"news ballads\".<ref name=\"McNeil p. 205\" />\n\nAlthough the genre's popularity lasted just one brief year, country artists returned to the form again and again<ref>Peterson p. 31</ref> \u2013 in the late 1920s, pioneers such as [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and the Carter Family and in the 1930s, early folk artists such as [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Lead Belly]].<ref>Wolfe p. 197-198</ref> The genre was revisited during the folk revival of the 1950s and 1960s, in particular, by [[Bob Dylan]], who wrote one of his first songs based on the same \"formula\" used by Jenkins, and [[Phil Ochs]], many of whose songs came directly from newspaper headlines.\n\nMeanwhile, Jenkins earned very little from the songs he wrote.<ref name=\"McNeil p. 205\">McNeil p. 205</ref> The hit \"The Death of Floyd Collins\", for example, brought him just $25, and under his agreement with the producer he was working with at Okeh, he also gave up all rights to the song.<ref>Peterson p. 24-25</ref> After experiencing copyright problems, Jenkins began keeping meticulous records of his songs. The practice eventually paid off. Years later, after [[Mahalia Jackson]] recorded one of his gospel songs, \"God Put a Rainbow in the Sky\", his stepdaughter Irene was able to prove the song was not in the public domain but was Jenkins's composition.<ref name=\"Miller p. 161\" />\n\n==Last recordings and later years==\nRev. Jenkins and the Jenkins Family continued to record with Okeh into the mid-1930s under a variety of names, including the Jenkins Sacred Singers, Irene Spain Family, Gooby Jenkins, Andrew Jenkins & [[Carson Robison]] and Jenkins & (Byron) Whitworth.<ref name=\"McNeil p. 205\" /> Jenkins cut his last record as an accompanied soloist billed as Blind Andy, a name he often recorded under, on April 23, 1930, while the Jenkins Family's last recording session for Okeh was July 30, 1934.<ref>Russell p. 455-7</ref>\n\nThe Jenkins Family's popularity opened Rev. Jenkins's ministry to a wide audience, as they performed at concerts and organized [[revival meeting]]s throughout Georgia. Over time, Jenkins also served as pastor of several churches. In 1939, he lost his eyesight completely, yet continued to preach until the time of his death and also broadcast as an evangelist on [[border blaster|Mexico's powerful, uncontrolled radio stations]].<ref name=\"Miller p. 161\" />\n\nJenkins was killed in an automobile accident in [[Thomaston, Georgia]], in 1957.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book | url =

So that was a real shot in the arm because I hadn't thought about it before, but I thought I might actually be a good singer if Jonathan Edwards is hiring me.\"<ref name=Lenker />\n\nIn 1983, Wheeler released her first album, a four-song EP called ''Newport Songs'', which is now out of print. Her next two releases \u2013 a self-titled album in 1986 and ''Half a Book'' in 1987 \u2013 were produced by North Star Records in Providence. The song \u201cAddicted,\u201d from the self-titled album, was recorded by country singer [[Dan Seals]] and became a No. 1 hit for him in 1988 on Billboard's Top 40 Country chart.<ref name=Bellaire2015 />\n\nFollowing the success of her first two full-length albums, Wheeler was signed to [[Capitol Records]] and released ''Circles and Arrows'' in 1990. [[Suzy Bogguss]] recorded Wheeler's song \u201cAces\u201d from this album, and it reached #9 on the country charts in 1992. Wheeler's next four albums \u2013 ''Driving Home'' (1993), ''Mrs. Pinocci's Guitar'' (1995), ''Sylvia Hotel'' (1999), and ''Defying Gravity'' (2005) \u2013 were produced by the folk-oriented Philo-Rounder Records in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<ref name=Bellaire2015 />\n\nIn 2003, Wheeler approved the production of a double disc album, ''No Previous Record'',<ref>{{Cite web|title=No Previous Record|url=http://cherylwheeler.com/discog/npr.html|website=Cherylwheeler.com|access-date=October 3, 2006|archive-date=October 12, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012134701/http://www.cherylwheeler.com/discog/npr.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> which contains songs that never made it onto a commercial recording.

As one reviewer wrote, she \u201cmasterfully blends blisteringly on-target observational humor, simple storytelling, gorgeous guitar work, and beautiful, rich songs.\u201d<ref name=Hill2007 /> Another commented on her \u201cfree-wheeling live concerts\u201d and called Wheeler a \u201cthoughtful, amusing musician and storyteller (and irrepressible social critic)\u2026. [H]er patter is a delicious, folk-flavored blend of Phyllis Diller and Mort Sahl, sometimes puckish, sometimes barbed.\u201d<ref name=McNally2017 />\n\nAbout half of the songs Wheeler performs in concert are not available on any of her albums.<ref name=Nostrand2016 /> Many never get recorded and eventually fade from her set list.

With each new recording and his continued touring, his popularity was increasing.\n\nTeaming up with [[Brent Maher]] and Steve Gibson in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], Johnson created a two-song demo consisting of \"[[Bluer Than Blue]]\" and \"[[Almost Like Being in Love]]\" (the latter song from the Broadway musical ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]''). [[EMI America]] took one listen and wasted no time in signing him, quickly getting ''The Michael Johnson Album'' out in 1978. \"Bluer Than Blue\" was written by Randy Goodrum.

She is the daughter of country singer Tex Dickerson and the sister of songwriter [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]. \n\nGail Davies established herself as a successful singer and songwriter during the 1970s and 1980s, scoring numerous Top 10 and Top 20 ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' hits. She was one of country music's most influential artists, becoming the genre's first female record producer. She has been cited as a role model for other female singers, including [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Kathy Mattea]], [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]], and [[Pam Tillis]].\n\n== Early life and career ==\nGail Davies was born in [[Broken Bow, Oklahoma]], United States.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Her father was a popular country singer in the 1940s, performing in and around the Texas/Oklahoma region and occasionally appearing on ''[[The Louisiana Hayride]]''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Although born in the South, Gail grew up in [[Washington (state)|Washington state]], where her mother remarried. Her last name was changed when she and her two brothers were adopted by their stepfather, Darby Davies. After graduating from high school, Gail moved to Los Angeles and married a [[jazz]] musician.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> She briefly sang [[jazz]], but quit after they divorced.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> She was later hired as a [[session musician|session singer]] at [[A&M Records]],<ref name=\"AMG\"/> working with such artists as [[Neil Young]], [[Hoyt Axton]] and [[Glen Campbell]]. She was able to sit in on a John Lennon session, produced by Phil Spector, and was befriended by songwriter, [[Joni Mitchell]]. Mitchell's recording engineer, Henry Lewy, taught Gail how to produce records. She was invited to tour Europe with [[Frank Zappa]], but turned the offer down to work with country artist [[Roger Miller]],<ref name=\"AMG\"/> making her television debut as his singing partner on ''[[The Merv Griffin Show]]''.\n\nEncouraged by her older brother, [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]], (he is best known for having written \"It Ain't Easy\" for [[David Bowie]] and \"Long Hard Climb\" for [[Helen Reddy]]),<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Gail soon began writing songs. She moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1976 and signed with [[EMI|EMI Publishing]] as a staff songwriter. One of her earliest compositions, \"Bucket to the South\", became a hit for [[Ava Barber]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> It was also recorded by [[Lynn Anderson]] and [[Mitzi Gaynor]], and became a standard on [[The Grand Ole Opry]] for country singer [[Wilma Lee Cooper]]. However, Davies was determined to prove she was a singer herself.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> She signed with CBS/Lifesong Records in 1978 and released a self-titled album that scored three Top 20 hit singles. Another of her original compositions, an introspective song entitled \"Someone Is Looking for Someone Like You\", was the album's highest charting single, reaching No.&nbsp;7 in ''[[Cashbox Magazine|Cashbox]]'' and No.&nbsp;11 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> This song has since been translated into seven languages and recorded by such internationally known artists as [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Susan McCann]], Iona & Andy, [[George Hamilton IV]] and [[The Country Gentlemen]].\n\n== Height of her career ==\nUnhappy with the production of her first album, Gail switched to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1979 and became the first female record producer in the history of country music.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Her album ''The Game'' was even more successful than her previous record had been. It featured a Top 10 single entitled \"Blue Heartache\", as well as two Top 20 hits, \"[[Like Strangers]]\" and another of her own compositions entitled \"Good Lovin' Man\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Gail went on to produce ''I'll Be There'' in 1980, which spawned three more Top 10 Billboard hit singles. The title track went to No.&nbsp;4 on the charts followed by \"It's a Lovely, Lovely World\" (with harmony vocals by [[Emmylou Harris]]), and another, which Davies wrote for her maternal grandmother, \"Grandma's Song\". Davies was nominated for an ACMA and CMA Award in 1981 and voted \"Best New Female Vocalist\" by The DJs of America.\n\nThe year 1982 showed that Davies was not slowing down. She released her third self-produced album ''Giving Herself Away''.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> This record brought another Top 10 hit, written by [[Rory Bourke]] and [[K.T. Oslin]], entitled \"Round the Clock Lovin'\". Her career took a short hiatus in the winter of 1982, when she gave birth to her only child, Christopher Scruggs, who is also the son of songwriter Gary Scruggs and the grandson of bluegrass musician [[Earl Scruggs]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nWarner Bros. Records released her last album for the label ''What Can I Say'' in 1983.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Although there were some sizable hits from this record, including two Top 20 singles \u2013 \"You're a Hard Dog (To Keep Under the Porch)\" and a self-penned song entitled \"[[Boys like You (Gail Davies song)|Boys like You]],\" \u2013 her chart success was beginning to wane. The last single from this album, a duet with [[Ricky Skaggs]] written by Gail's brother, Ron Davies, was entitled \"It's You Alone.\" It was released just as Davies was preparing to leave Warner Bros. Records. With no promotional support from the label it stalled at No.&nbsp;55 on the Billboard chart.\n\nShe signed with [[RCA Records]] in 1984 and released ''Where Is a Woman to Go''. Produced by Gail and [[James Taylor]]'s bass player, [[Leland Sklar]], this album featured two more hit singles \u2013 \"[[Break Away (Gail Davies song)|Breakaway]]\", which went to No.&nbsp;15 on the charts and \"Jagged Edge of a Broken Heart,\" climbing to No.&nbsp;20. The last single from this album, a duet with Dolly Parton entitled \"Unwed Fathers,\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/> was said to be too controversial for country radio. Written by John Prine and Bobby Braddock, this song barely made it into the Billboard Top 50.\n\nInspired by a trip to England in 1985, she formed a country/rock band called [[Wild Choir]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> They released one self-titled album on RCA Records and three Billboard singles \u2013 \"Heart To Heart, \"Safe in the Arms of Love\" and \"Next Time,\" written by Davies, Pam Rose and Mary Ann Kennedy.\n\nIn 1989, Davies signed with [[MCA Records]] and produced an album of 10 self-penned compositions entitled ''Pretty Words''. The album garnered two more Top 50 singles \"Waiting Here For You\" and \"Hearts in the Wind\". The song the record company chose not to release, written by Davies and [[Harry Stinson (musician)|Harry Stinson]], was entitled \"Tell Me Why.\" It went on to become a hit for Curb recording artist Jann Browne.\n\nShe moved to [[Capitol Records]] in 1989 and released two albums \u2013 ''The Other Side of Love'' and ''The Best Of Gail Davies''. Hired by Capitol/EMI in 1990 to become Nashville's first female staff producer, Davies spent four years working with young artists such as [[Mandy Barnett]] before starting her own record label, Little Chickadee Productions. She produced and released an album in 1995 entitled ''Eclectic'', which was chosen by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as one of the \"Ten Best Country Albums of the Year.\" Other LCP releases include ''Gail Davies Greatest Hits'', ''Love Ain't Easy'', ''Live and Unplugged at the Station Inn'', ''The Songwriter Sessions'', ''Since I Don't Have You'' (featuring [[Benny Golson]]), and ''Beyond the Realm of Words'' produced by Davies and Chris Scruggs.\n\n==Later career and life today==\nDavies received an [[International Bluegrass Music Awards|IBMA]] award, along with a [[Grammy Award]] nomination, for her duet with [[Ralph Stanley]] in 2002. She was nominated for an [[Americana Music Honors & Awards|Americana Music Award]] that same year for producing and arranging a tribute to [[Webb Pierce]] entitled ''Caught in the Webb''. This album featured, along with Davies, [[George Jones]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Pam Tillis]], [[Dwight Yoakam]], [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Charley Pride]], [[The Del McCoury Band]], [[Allison Moorer]], [[Guy Clark]], [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]], [[The Jordanaires]], [[Rosie Flores]], [[Lionel Cartwright]], [[Robbie Fulks]], [[Mandy Barnett]] and [[Billy Walker (musician)|Billy Walker]]. Proceeds from this album benefit The Minnie Pearl Cancer Foundation and The Country Music Hall of Fame. Davies was inducted into The Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 2018.\n\nAlthough semi-retired, Davies continues to tour, mostly in Europe. She was named \"Country Music International Ambassador\" during CMA week in 2009 and released her autobiography, ''The Last of the Outlaws'', in 2011. Her latest project is an album dedicated to her late brother entitled ''Unsung Hero: A Tribute To The Music of Ron Davies''. Released in 2013, this album features Dolly Parton, John Prine, Alison Krauss, Vince Gill, Shelby Lynne, Rodney Crowell, Suzy Bogguss, John Anderson, Guy Clark, Bonnie Bramlett, and Jazz legend Benny Golson, among others. Proceeds from this album benefit The W.O. Smith Music School and provide musical instruments and lessons for underprivileged children.\n\n== Personal life ==\nGail's son, [[Chris Scruggs]], is a former co-lead singer and guitarist for the roots-country band [[BR5-49|BR549]] and, as of 20204, has been the bassist of [[Marty Stuart]]'s Fabulous Superlatives band since 2015.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main article|Gail Davies discography}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.gaildavies.com/home.htm Gail Davies official website]\n* [https://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/gail-davies Gail Davies Interview] NAMM Oral History Library (2019)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Gail Davies}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davies, Gail}}\n[[Category:1948 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Broken Bow, Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:American women country singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Warner Records artists]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:American women record producers]]\n[[Category:Record producers from Oklahoma]]\n[[Category:21st-century American women]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

Accessed July 1, 2015.</ref> He wrote numerous songs, such as \"[[Pancho and Lefty]]\", \"[[For the Sake of the Song#Composition|For the Sake of the Song]]\", \"[[If I Needed You]]\", \"Snake Mountain Blues\", \"Our Mother the Mountain\", \"Waitin' Round to Die\", and \"[[To Live Is to Fly]]\". His musical style has often been described as melancholic and features rich, poetic lyrics.

When Tommy Hall found  out he never played bass, he kicked him out of the audition.\n\nIn 1968, Van Zandt met songwriter [[Mickey Newbury]] in a Houston coffee shop. Newbury persuaded Van Zandt to go to Nashville, Tennessee, where he was introduced by Newbury to the man who became his longtime producer, [[Jack Clement|\"Cowboy\" Jack Clement]].\n\nVan Zandt cited Lightnin' Hopkins, Bob Dylan, and Hank Williams and such varied artists as [[Muddy Waters]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Blind Willie McTell]], [[Tchaikovsky]], and [[Jefferson Airplane]] as having had a major impact on his music.<ref name=\"tvzfaq\" />\n\n=== 1970s ===\nThe years between 1968 and 1973 proved to be his most prolific era.<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> Van Zandt released six albums during the time period: ''[[For the Sake of the Song]]'', ''[[Our Mother the Mountain]]'', ''[[Townes Van Zandt (album)|Townes Van Zandt]]'', ''[[Delta Momma Blues]]'', ''[[High, Low and In Between]]'', and ''[[The Late Great Townes Van Zandt]]''. Among the tracks written for these albums were \"To Live Is to Fly\", \"[[Pancho and Lefty]]\", and \"[[If I Needed You]]\". These songs eventually raised Van Zandt to near-legend status in American and European songwriting circles.<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\nIn 1972, he recorded tracks for an album with a working title of ''Seven Come Eleven'', which remained unreleased for many years due to a dispute between his manager Kevin Eggers and producer Jack Clement. Eggers either could not or refused to pay for the studio sessions, so Clement erased the master tapes. However, before they were deleted, Eggers sneaked into the studio and recorded rough mixes of the songs on to a [[cassette tape]]. Tracks from the aborted ''Seven Come Eleven'' debacle later surfaced on ''The Nashville Sessions''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nIn 1975, Van Zandt was featured prominently in the documentary film ''[[Heartworn Highways]]'' with [[Guy Clark]], [[Steve Earle]], [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]], [[Gamble Rogers]], [[Charlie Daniels]] and [[David Allan Coe]].

He soon signed with Eggers' new label, [[Tomato Records]].<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> The following year, he recorded ''[[Flyin' Shoes]]''; he did not release another album until 1987's ''[[At My Window (album)|At My Window]]''. Despite critical acclaim, he remained a cult figure. He normally played small venues (often to crowds of fewer than fifty people) but began to move towards playing larger venues (and even made a handful of television appearances) during the 1990s. For much of the 1970s, he lived a reclusive life outside of Nashville in a tin-roofed, bare-boards shack with no heat, plumbing or telephone, occasionally appearing in town to play shows.<ref name=\"dallasmusic\" />\n\n=== 1980s\u20131990s ===\nSeveral of Van Zandt's compositions were recorded by other artists, such as [[Emmylou Harris]] who, with [[Don Williams]], had a No. 3 country hit in 1981 with \"[[If I Needed You]],\" and [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Merle Haggard]], the pair taking \"Pancho and Lefty\" to No. 1 on the country charts in 1983. Van Zandt had a small cameo appearance in the video for the song. In his later years, he recorded less frequently, his voice and singing style altered in part because of his drug addiction and alcoholism. However, he continued writing songs, such as \"Marie\" and \"The Hole\".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAccording to Susanna Clark, Van Zandt turned down repeated invitations to write with Bob Dylan.<ref name=\"deeperblue203\">{{harvnb|Hardy|2008|p=203}}</ref> Dylan was reportedly a \"big fan\" of Townes and claimed to have all of his records; Van Zandt admired Dylan's songs, but didn't care for his celebrity.<ref name=\"deeperblue203\" /> The two first met during a chance encounter outside a costume shop in the [[South Congress]] district of Austin, on June 21, 1986.<ref name=\"deeperblue203\" /> According to Johnny Guess, Dylan later arranged another meeting with the songwriter.

[[Judy Collins discography|Her discography]] consists of 36 studio albums, nine live albums, numerous compilation albums, four holiday albums, and 21 [[single (music)|singles]].\n\nCollins' debut studio album, ''[[A Maid of Constant Sorrow]]'', was released in 1961 and consisted of traditional [[Folk music|folk songs]]. She had her first charting single with \"Hard Lovin' Loser\" (No. 97) from her fifth studio album ''[[In My Life (Judy Collins album)|In My Life]]'' (1966), but it was the [[lead single]] from her sixth studio album ''[[Wildflowers (Judy Collins album)|Wildflowers]]'' (1967), \"[[Both Sides, Now]]\" \u2013 written by [[Joni Mitchell]] \u2013 that gave her international prominence.

Three years after her debut as a piano [[Child prodigy|prodigy]], she was playing guitar. Her first public appearances as a folk artist after her graduation from Denver's East High School were at Michael's Pub in [[Boulder, Colorado]] and the folk club Exodus in Denver.

Collins' ninth studio album ''[[True Stories and Other Dreams]]'' (1973) found her in a contemplative mood, featuring an original song about a friend who took his own life (\"Song for Martin\") and another about the life of Argentine [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (\"Che\"). For her tenth studio album ''[[Judith (album)|Judith]]'' (1975), she collaborated with producer [[Arif Mardin]], who gave the album a sophisticated sound. ''Judith'' produced her biggest hit single with her mournful version of Stephen Sondheim's \"[[Send in the Clowns]]\", and it would become her best-selling record, eventually going platinum.\n\nAs Collins stepped up to a higher level of stardom, the longtime activist put political themes at the forefront of her eleventh studio album  ''[[Bread and Roses (album)|Bread and Roses]]'' (1976). Political statements like the title song, originally a poem by [[James Oppenheim]] commonly associated with a 1912 [[1912 Lawrence textile strike|garment workers strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], were balanced with such pop compositions as [[Elton John]]'s \"Come Down in Time\", but the album failed to achieve the commercial success of ''Judith''. Following the release of the album, Collins underwent treatment for damaged vocal cords, and after years of struggling with alcoholism, she sought medical help to give up drinking. Her compilation album ''[[So Early in the Spring (Judy Collins album)|So Early in the Spring... The First 15 Years]]'' (1977) sold modestly.\n\n[[File:Zangeres Judy Collins in Hiltonhotel Amsterdam, Judy Collins, Bestanddeelnr 925-1517.jpg|thumb|right| Collins in Hilton Amsterdam, a hotel, in 1971]]\nCollins guest starred on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in an episode broadcast in January 1978,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=978-0786442591|page=[https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218 218]|url=https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218}}</ref> singing \"[[Leather-Winged Bat]]\", \"[[There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly]]\", \"[[Do-Re-Mi]]\", and \"Send in the Clowns\".

''[[Home Again (Judy Collins album)|Home Again]]'' (1984) found her exploring some new musical avenues, including a synth-based cover of [[Yazoo (band)|Yaz's]] \"Only You\" and a duet with country star [[T. G. Sheppard]] on the title cut. While the \"Home Again\" single was a minor hit, the album was not, and after 23 years, Collins and [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] parted ways. She performed the music for the 1983 animated television special ''[[The Magic of Herself the Elf]]'', as well as the theme song of the [[Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment|Rankin/Bass Productions]] television film ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1987 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Woolery|first=George W.|title=Animated TV Specials|year=1989|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810821989|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/animatedtvspecia0000wool}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Judy Collins.jpg|thumb|Collins at a book signing, 1995|left]]\nCollins traveled to England in 1985 and struck a one-off deal with Telstar Records to record the studio album ''[[Amazing Grace (Judy Collins album)|Amazing Grace]]'', in which she re-recorded several of her better-known songs with an inspirational bent.

Rodgers had a run of hits and mainstream popularity in the 1950s and 1960s. His string of crossover singles ranked highly on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles]], [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]], and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm and Blues Sides]] charts; in the 1960s, Rodgers had more modest successes with [[adult contemporary music]].\n\nHe was not related to country music pioneer [[Jimmie Rodgers|Jimmie C. Rodgers]] (1897\u20131933), who died the same year the younger Rodgers was born. Among country audiences, and in his official songwriting credits, the younger Rodgers, Jimmie Frederick, was often credited as '''Jimmie F. Rodgers''' to differentiate the two.\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nRodgers was born in [[Camas, Washington]].<ref name=\"auto4\">Wayne Harada. \"Spotlighted Singer.\" ''Honolulu Advertiser'', September 15, 1957, p. 36.</ref>  He was the second son of Archie and Mary Rodgers.<ref name=\"auto2\">John Vergara, \"Oh, Oh, He's Done It Again.\" ''New York Daily News'', April 27, 1958, p.

Although he loved music, he was uncertain whether he could turn it into a career. He was subsequently drafted and served in the United States Air Force during the Korean War.<ref name=\"auto\">Dick Kleiner. \"Honeycomb Started Here.\" ''(Nashville) The Tennessean'', November 3, 1957, p. 7C.</ref>\n\n=== 1950s ===\nWhile in the Air Force, Rodgers joined a band named The Melodies started by violinist Phil Clark.

His biggest hit of the decade in the UK was \"English Country Garden\", a version of the folk song \"[[Country Gardens]]\", which reached number 5 in the chart in June 1962.<ref name=\"British Hit Singles & Albums\" />  In 1962, he moved to the [[Dot Records|Dot]] label, and four years later to [[A&M Records]]. He also appeared in some films, including ''[[The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (1961 film)|The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come]]'' and ''[[Back Door to Hell]]'', which he helped finance.\n\nIn 1966, a long dry spell ended for Rodgers when he re-entered the Top 40 with \"[[It's Over (Jimmie Rodgers song)|It's Over]]\" (later to be recorded by [[Eddy Arnold]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Mason Williams]], [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], and [[Sonny James]]).

Meanwhile, his voice was still being heard: Several of his earlier hits were used in jingles in the 1970s, one for [[SpaghettiOs]] and another for [[Honeycomb (cereal)|Honeycomb]] breakfast cereal.<ref name=\"auto3\" /> And Rodgers' songs continued to make the ''Billboard'' Country and Easy Listening charts until 1979.

Among the earliest was a series of shows in late February 1983: he performed at [[Harrah's Reno]] Casino Cabaret.<ref name=\"auto1\" /> He also performed a few shows in other cities, including at a nightclub named Mister Days in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in late 1983.<ref>Tim Smith. \"Jimmie Rodgers Rides Sweet Nostalgia Wave.\" ''Fort Lauderdale News/Sun-Sentinel'', May 27, 1983, p. 22.</ref>\n\nRodgers appeared in the 1999 video ''Rock & Roll Graffiti'' by American Public Television, along with about 20 other performers.<ref name=\"auto6\">{{Cite news |title=Street signs point to Jimmie Rodgers Avenue |work=The Columbian |url=https://www.columbian.com/news/2013/sep/13/street-signs-point-to-jimmie-rodgers-avenue/}}</ref> Nevertheless, he gave \"Honeycomb\" a try, and he mentioned that he had a show in Branson, Missouri.\n\nRodgers returned to his hometown of Camas, Washington in 2011 and 2012, performing to sell-out crowds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} In 2013, his neighbors successfully got a street named after him, in the neighborhood where he grew up.<ref name=\"auto6\" />\n\n==Head injuries==\nOn December 1, 1967, Rodgers suffered traumatic head injuries after the car he was driving was stopped by an off-duty police officer near the San Diego Freeway in Los Angeles.

She was the second female artist to win a country music accolade from the [[Grammy Awards]], which came off the success of her 1965 song \"[[Queen of the House]]\". By blending multiple genres together, Miller's music was considered influential for other music artists.\n\nMiller was born in Arizona, but raised in [[Blanchard, Oklahoma]]. With a passion for folk music, she moved to [[Los Angeles, California]] following high school to pursue a music career. Her singing attracted the attention of [[Capitol Records]], which signed her to a recording contract in 1963. The label released her debut studio album titled ''[[Wednesday's Child Is Full of Woe (album)|Wednesday's Child Is Full of Woe]]'' in 1963. It was Miller's [[answer song]] to [[Roger Miller]]'s \"[[King of the Road (song)|King of the Road]]\" titled \"Queen of the House\" that became her first commercial success. It became a top 20 pop song and a top five country song. It was followed by the top 25 pop single \"[[Home of the Brave (song)|Home of the Brave]]\" that discussed social conformity. Miller remained at Capitol recording various material until 1969.\n\nMiller was then signed to the country music label, [[Epic Records]]. Under the direction of [[Billy Sherrill]], she remade pop hits into singles for the country market. She had top ten country singles with covers of \"[[He's So Fine]]\" (1971), \"[[Baby I'm Yours (Barbara Lewis song)|Baby I'm Yours]]\" (1971) and original songs like \"[[There's a Party Goin' On]]\" (1972). The Epic label released a series of singles and albums that made the North American country music charts through the end of the 1970s. She was nominated for another Grammy for Epic material and appeared on several popular country television programs during the decade.\n\nMiller left her recording career in the early 1980s. She spent time with her domestic duties and to assist her husband's new business raising quarter horses in Oklahoma. In 1988, she returned with a pair of new studio albums including a project of [[American patriotic music|patriotic music]] called ''My Country''. It attracted the attention of [[George H. W. Bush]], who had Miller perform at his campaign rallies and other presidential events. In the 1990s, Miller found solace in the religion of [[Christianity]] and released several albums of [[Gospel music|gospel]] material. This included ''Real Good Feelin'' (1992) and ''Higher'' (1999). Miller continued her career through the 2020s, before her death from [[Parkinson's disease]] in 2022.\n\n==Early life==\nMyrna Joy Miller was born in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] in 1941 while her family was on their way to start a new life in [[Oakland, California]].<ref name=McDonnell>{{cite news|title=Country singer Jody Miller, one of Oklahoma's first Grammy winners, dies|url=https://www.oklahoman.com/story/entertainment/2022/10/06/singer-jody-miller-one-of-oklahomas-first-grammy-winners-dies/69545567007/|first=Brandy|last=McDonnell|date=October 6, 2022|access-date=October 6, 2022|newspaper=[[The Oklahoman]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20221007033601/https://www.oklahoman.com/story/entertainment/2022/10/06/singer-jody-miller-one-of-oklahomas-first-grammy-winners-dies/69545567007/|archivedate=October 7, 2022}}</ref> She was the youngest of four sisters<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|pages=264/5}}</ref> born to Johnny Bell Miller and Fay Miller.

Some of his best-known works and interpretations are \"[[Wabash Cannonball]]\", \"Country Fried Pickin'\", \"U2 Medley\", \"Be Still\", \"[[Amazing Grace]]\" and \"[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]\". Dykes is a devout [[Christians|Christian]] and has served as a minister in a small church in Florida;<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.75\">Dykes (2011), p.75</ref> the influence of Christianity is present in much of his work. He was a major endorser of [[Taylor Guitars]] and [[Rivera Amplifiers|Rivera]] Sedona amplifiers, with his own signature models of each. In 2013 he began endorsing the [[Guild Guitar Company]]. Since 2015 he has touted his custom steel-fret Olson guitar as his \"favorite guitar.\"\n\n== Biography ==\nDykes was born in [[Cleveland, Tennessee|Cleveland]], [[Tennessee]] and grew up in Jacksonville, Florida in a Christian community. His father is referred to as \"Bubba Dykes\" and he has a brother named Aubrey.<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.35\"/> He cites June 1965 during his church's \"summer revival\" as the moment he became a lifelong Christian as an 11-year-old boy, seeing \"the lights of salvation and a new purpose and desire for my life and since that day, I've never been the same\".<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.35\">Dykes (2011), p.35</ref> His first guitar was a $30 Sears Roebuck Silvertone acoustic.<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.32\">Dykes (2011), p.32</ref> Dykes claims a sailor named Barry Lackey was the most important influence in his development as a guitarist. Lackey attended his church one day, and using a thumbpick from his pocket, \"completely blew him away\" with his \"spider picking\", playing just like [[Chet Atkins]] and [[Merle Travis]], Doyle's heroes.<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.45\">Dykes (2011), p.45-7</ref> Lackey was then invited to his home for supper that night and showed him a right-hand picking pattern that \"got his fingers working together in the right way, where the thumb played the bass and after-beat rhythm, and the three fingers took care of the rest.\"<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.45\"/> He later reunited with Lackey at a Taylor Guitars event in [[Detroit]] in 2002, and said that were it not for him, he would never have become a successful guitarist.<ref name=\"Dykes2011, p.45\"/>\n\nDykes' early years as a guitarist took him around the world as he toured with [[J. D. Sumner|the Stamps Quartet]] and later with [[Grand Ole Opry]] star [[Grandpa Jones]]. Dykes has since returned to the Grand Ole Opry for numerous performances. Although a world-renowned guitarist, Dykes frequently plays church venues with small audiences, and some intimate shows that aren't advertised, stating, \"I've been blessed with the opportunity to play music for people.\"<ref name=\"NAMM\"/>\n[[File:Dykes and Emmanuel.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Performing with [[Tommy Emmanuel]] in the Netherlands, April 2006]]\nDykes was a longtime endorser of [[Taylor Guitars]]. According to owner [[Bob Taylor (luthier)|Bob Taylor]], \"If I had to pick the artist who most represented the Taylor Guitars brand and who has done the most for us, I would say Doyle Dykes.

''Inside Belleville'', May 03, 2012</ref> is a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[musical group|band]] based in [[Buena Vista, Virginia]] and was formed in September 1994. Its \"parent band\"{{clarify|date=June 2022}} East Coast Bluegrass Band was formed Summer 1985 to compete in the East Coast Bluegrass Championship in [[Crimora, Virginia]].<ref>*[http://bluegrasscountry.org/programs/aotm/nothin-fancy/ Bluegrass Country] profile \"October 2004: Nothin' Fancy\".</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== East Coast Bluegrass Band ===\nThe East Coast Bluegrass Band was the predecessor to Nothin' Fancy formed in 1985. It was formed to compete in the East Coast Bluegrass Championship in [[Crimora, Virginia]].<ref name=belleville /> In 1986 the group won the Virginia Folk Music Society State Bluegrass Band Championship.<ref name=\"samhillbands.com\">[http://www.samhillbands.com/bands/eastcoast/index.shtml \"Biography: East Coast Bluegrass Band\"] Sam Hill Entertainment.</ref> After winning the contest, the band continued to play together at local functions.   The members of the band developed some original material, but remained true to the traditional style of the great [[bluegrass band]]s of the 1940s and 1950s.<ref name=\"samhillbands.com\"/> Nothin' Fancy was formed in 1994. Mike Andes and Mitchell Davis joined forces with Gary Farris on guitar, Tony Shorter on bass, and Guy Carawan on fiddle to play the same East Coast Bluegrass Championship in September 1994 that East Coast Bluegrass Band had once played almost a decade earlier. Nothin' Fancy released their first project \"Bluegrass in a Plain Brown Wrapper\" shortly afterwards.\n\nNothin' Fancy and East Coast Bluegrass Band continued to coexist until 2000 when East Coast Bluegrass Band's members drifted apart and had to reorganize.\n\n=== Notable Changes ===\nChris Sexton, who had appeared with Nothin' Fancy for their first-place victory in the band competition at the Maury River Fiddler's Convention in 1998 and recorded as a guest fiddler on the band's second and third releases (\"Earn Your Ticket\" and \"Field of Dreams,\" respectively), officially became the newest member of Nothin' Fancy in 2000.  The fourth project, ''Now and Then'' is the first album to feature the five-piece group as it is today.\n\nShorter departed from the group in 2005, and was replaced by Eli Johnston of [[Branson, MO]].  Nothin' Fancy released \"Album No.&nbsp;7\" under Pinecastle with Johnston and featured him as the lead vocal on the song \"Tupelo County Jail,\" but Johnston only stayed with the group for 13 months.  Citing artistic differences, he left the group and joined the band Pine Mountain Railroad.  Nothin' Fancy's members called Shorter back into service in time for the 6th Annual Nothin' Fancy Bluegrass Festival.  Shorter, who at the time was playing bass for country star [[Keith Bryant]], happily agreed and the band was re-united with its original cast and has stayed as such since.\n\nGary Farris, the guitar player, also departed the group in July 2012 and was replaced by Justin Tomlin.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/justin-tomlin-to-nothin-fancy/ \"Justin Tomlin to Nothin\u2019 Fancy\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref> Tomlin left in March 2014, and Jesse Smathers joined the group in his place.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/jesse-smathers-to-nothin-fancy \"Jesse Smathers to Nothin Fancy\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref> In June 2015, Jesse Smathers departed the group and was replaced by guitar and dobro player, Caleb Cox.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/jesse-smathers-to-lonesome-river-band \"Jesse Smathers to Lonesome River Band\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref> A month later, the band signed a recording contract with Mountain Fever Records and released their first project for the label \"By Any Other Name\" in August 2015.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/nothin-fancy-to-mountain-fever \"Nothin\u2019 Fancy to Mountain Fever\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>\n\nIn 2019, founding member Mitchell Davis announced that he would be leaving the band. Following his departure, the band announced in March of that year that it had signed on Jacob Flick to take up Davis' role on the banjo.<ref>[https://bluegrasstoday.com/jacob-flick-to-nothin-fancy \"Jacob Flick to Nothin\u2019 Fancy\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>\n\nIn June 2021, it was announced that Jacobe \"Jake\" Lauzon would be joining the band to play guitar and provide vocals. Jake, originally from Ontario, Canada, was a welcome addition to the group, having been was recognized as the Bluegrass Guitar Player of the Year in 2018 and 2019 at the Central Canadian Bluegrass Awards.<ref>[https://bluegrasstoday.com/jake-lauzon-to-nothin-fancy-on-guitar/ \"Jake Lauzon to Nothin\u2019 Fancy\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>\n\nIn September 2022, it was announced that Jake Lauzon would be departing from the band to pursue new musical interests after playing one final set at the 20th Nothin' Fancy Festival.\n\nIn December 2022, the band announced that it had found its new guitar player, Curt Gausman. Curt, who got his bluegrass start in the 1980s, was part of Hobbs and Partners, which was led by Arnold Hobbs. The group also included John Paganoni, John\u2019s son Chris (who filled in as a substitute with Nothin\u2019 Fancy on more than one occasion), and Mark Delaney. From his work with Hobbs, he later formed the Hazel River Band, which he led through 1996 and recorded two albums with the Hay Holler label. <ref>[https://bluegrasstoday.com/curt-gausman-to-nothin-fancy/ \"Curt Gausman to Nothin\u2019 Fancy\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\n\nEast Coast Bluegrass Band released four self-produced albums.  They then contracted [[Tim Austin]] of [[Doobie Shea Records|Doobie Shea Studios]] to produce and record the project. Recording began in February 1996. Later that spring, lightning struck and destroyed the studio and all the recorded sessions. Once it was up and running again they were one of the first acts to record in the new studio.<ref name=\"samhillbands.com\"/> After four albums, thirteen years, and hundreds of performances, the band released their first nationally distributed recording project, ''Life's Mysteries'' on [[Copper Creek Records]].\n\nThe group, now appearing as Nothin' Fancy, was approached by [[Pinecastle Records]] and signed to the label in 2002.  They recorded their fifth project, \"Once Upon a Road\" with the title song written for the band by [[Tom T. Hall]] and his wife Dixie.  \"Once Upon a Road\" rose to number 10 on the Bluegrass Charts as posted by [[Bluegrass Unlimited]].  Their bluegrass gospel song \"When the Angels Take My Hand\" rose to the Number 1 spot on the Bluegrass Gospel charts as posted by (the now-defunct) ''Bluegrass Now'' magazine.  The album also earned them a showcase at the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] (IBMA) Convention in October 2002 and a nomination for the [[International Bluegrass Music Awards|IBMA]] Emerging Artist of the Year Award.\n\nTheir sixth album, \"Reflections,\" was a much more personal album, with Andes penning 10 of the 13 songs.  It featured the novelty single \"I Met My Baby in the Porta-John Line\" as a bonus track, also by Andes.  \"Reflections\" was not as commercially successful as \"Once Upon a Road,\" but it was from these two albums and the performances from this period that Nothin' Fancy had found its highly unique voice, which paid homage to bands such as the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] and the [[Seldom Scene]].  The late [[Charlie Waller (American musician)|Charlie Waller]], a founding member of the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] who went on to lead that group until his death in 2004, met with Andes at the [http://www.spbgma.com/ Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music of America] annual convention and learned the song \"Heaven Got an Angel\" from Andes (that was recorded originally on \"Field of Dreams\") and recorded it on the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] album \"Cryin' in the Chapel.\"\n\nTheir eighth album, ''Lord Bless This House'', the first all-gospel recording for the group, was officially released January 27, 2009 through [http://www.pinecastle.com/ Pinecastle].  Co-produced by Grammy-nominated bluegrass artist [[Rhonda Vincent]] and her brother Darrin Vincent (of Dailey and Vincent fame) with guest appearances from the both of them, it is frequently played on [[Sirius XM]] Radio's [[Bluegrass Junction]] station, along with other selections from their discography.\n\n''Undeniable'' is the group's 16th studio recording, released in 2019 to celebrate their 25th year together. The album includes all-original songwriting by Mike Andes, Caleb Cox, and Chris Sexton. It features Mike Andes (mandolin, lead/harmony vocals), Chris Sexton (fiddle, harmony vocals), Caleb Cox (guitar, lead/harmony vocals), James Cox (bass), and Jacob Flick (banjo). Cello, viola, and string arrangements on \u201cHere\u2019s To My Life\u201d were provided by Chris Sexton. The album was recorded, mixed, and mastered at Mountain Fever Studios in [[Willis, Floyd County, Virginia|Willis, Virginia]] and released by [[Mountain Fever Records]].\n\n== Performance ==\n\nEast Coast Bluegrass Band paid their dues at lawn parties and bars in and around the [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]] area and the [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] area for many years.  In years since, the band, as Nothin' Fancy, has played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] at the historic [[Ryman Auditorium]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]],<ref>[http://www.bluegrassworks.com/profile.php?profileID=31 Bluegrass Works] interview \"Nothin' Fancy\" with Loretta Sawyer, 03/25/2004.</ref> and with the \"Bluegrass Series with [[Rhonda Vincent]] & Nothin' Fancy\".<ref>[http://nemr.net/~rhondav/ Official Website] Rhonda Vincent.</ref> They have played such other major venues as [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City]], and [[The Birchmere]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].  Nothin' Fancy plays about 140 shows a year and is a staple on the bluegrass festival circuit.<ref>[http://journalstar.com/articles/2007/09/28/living/gz/performances/doc46fb0ee5f118e173797113.txt Lincoln Journal Star] \"Members of Nothin' Fancy tell bluegrass listeners to expect something different\" by L. Kent Wolgamott, September 28, 2007.</ref> The band has been known to take fans on bus trips to festivals and accompanying them on bluegrass cruises aboard the [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] and [[Carnival]] cruises.<ref>[http://bluegrasscountry.org/programs/aotm/nothin-fancy/ Bluegrass Country] profile \"October 2004: Nothin' Fancy\".</ref> Nothin' Fancy performed in June 2010 at the Tottenhan Bluegrass Festival in [[Ontario, Canada]], and the band toured as part of the 2012 Bluegrass Sundays Winter Concert series organized by the Northern Bluegrass Committee in Scarborough, Ontario.<ref>\"Bluegrass Sundays\" concert program, Northern Bluegrass Committee, 2012</ref>\n\n== Musical style and sound ==\nThe band seeks to remain \"true to the traditional sounds of the great bluegrass bands of the 1940s and '50s\",<ref name=\"samhillbands.com\"/> while also performing and recording original songs by their prolific songwriter, lead singer Mike Andes.  Classic bluegrass material draws from [[Bill Monroe]], [[Ralph Stanley]], the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]], and the [[Seldom Scene]]; but song selection ranges from original material to gospel classics to covers of pop artists such as [[Bob Seger]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Bill Withers]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]].\n\nIn live performance Nothin' Fancy has been noted for its strong vocals, four-part arrangements, and its high-energy shows well-seasoned with humor.  The quintet's early years saw the band gathering around one microphone, employing a shell-game choreography for solos and back-up which keeps the show visually active as well as aurally pleasing, although the most recent configuration is more traditional with individual microphones for instruments and vocals. Andes' clear singing style is attributed to the unique stylings of [[Charlie Waller (American musician)|Charlie Waller]], whose earthy bass-baritone voice sang with clear enunciation.  Farris sings a bold tenor harmony remarkable for its projection; his powerful delivery has been likened to the late [[John Duffey]] of the [[Seldom Scene]].  Shorter occasionally sings baritone harmonies an octave higher, while Davis sings bass vocals, more on gospel songs. In later recordings, Davis gave up singing bass and allowed Sexton to sing bass on gospel songs\n\n==Nothin' Fancy Bluegrass Festival==\nIn 2001, a Rockbridge County entrepreneur, Morris O'Shields, created a bluegrass festival at the Glen Maury Park, the site of the Maury River Fiddler's Convention where Nothin' Fancy won its victory three years before.  The festival was named for Nothin' Fancy, who have served as the host act in years since.<ref>[http://www.rockbridgeweekly.com/rw_article.php?ndx=9737 Rockbridge Weekly] \"Virginia Based Bluegrass Band Nothin' Fancy Garners National Music Award\".</ref>  Just as the band originally named itself after the first music festival in which it competed\u2014subsequently winning the prize\u2014it then had a music festival, whose competition it had also won, subsequently named for it.\n\nThe so-named festival has become a much-loved annual event that brings scores of bluegrass fans to the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and to the little town of [[Buena Vista, VA]], where Farris calls home (and from which the band operates).  Held each year at the Glen Maury Park in [[Buena Vista, Virginia]], the [[music festival|festival]] has perennially played host to major [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[musical group|band]]s.

She called it a point in her life that profoundly affected her because it was a traumatic passage out of innocence.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 53.</ref>\n\n===1950s===\nIn the mid-1950s MacNeil's parents sold their store and began a big move that would take them to [[Sydney, Nova Scotia|Sydney]], then to [[Toronto]].<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 54.</ref> MacNeil's father worked as a carpenter, her mother worked at [[Eaton's]], and her sister Mary worked at a local grocery store.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 56.</ref> Alcoholism, already a large part of her parents' life, became worse in Toronto, especially with her mother's desire to move back to Cape Breton.

She had just finished Grade 11 when she took a summer job in Toronto, along with her friend Carolyn Tobin, working for [[Canadian National Railway|CNR]].<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 75</ref><ref name=\"On A Personal Note. p. 76\">''On A Personal Note''. p. 76</ref> Upon returning to Sydney in the fall, MacNeil knew she wanted nothing more than to begin her singing career, and with her parents' support she moved right back to Toronto to get started.<ref name=\"On A Personal Note. p. 76\"/>\n\nLike her mother, MacNeil worked for Eaton's, in the Customer Account Services Department<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 77</ref> By 1964 she had begun taking voice lessons.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 87</ref> She had also met a man she described as Sicilian, with jet black hair, brown eyes and very white teeth.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 82</ref> She began dating this man although he had told her his parents wanted him to marry a Sicilian woman. She became pregnant in 1965; frightened and unsure of the future, she returned to her parents, who cared for and supported her.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 97</ref>\n\nOn April 15, 1966, MacNeil gave birth to her daughter Laura.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 98</ref> She also started struggling with her weight, which fluctuated from 119 to 183 pounds.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 99</ref> That summer MacNeil decided to continue working toward her singing goals as she made a life for her daughter. Leaving Laura with her parents, she returned to Toronto<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p.100</ref> and her Eaton's job.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 101</ref>\n\nThat fall she met David Langham. By spring 1967 she had married Langham in a small ceremony that included the bride's sister, the groom's brother, and a minister. In her autobiography she wrote that she wore a royal-blue suit and a pink [[pillbox hat]], while Langham wore a suit.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 207</ref> The newlyweds moved Laura into their Toronto home in August 1967.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 109</ref>\n\nLangham and MacNeil left Toronto in the summer of 1968, purchasing a 78-acre farm in the village of [[Dundalk, Ontario|Dundalk]].<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 114</ref> MacNeil's second child, Wade, was born there on April 30, 1970.<ref>''On A Personal Note''. p. 119</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nMacNeil longed to return to the city and convinced Langham to sell the farm, and in the fall of 1970 they moved to [[Etobicoke]], just outside the City of Toronto. Growing restless in her marriage, MacNeil made one last attempt to save her relationship by moving back to Cape Breton with her family in 1975.<ref name=\"On A Personal Note. p. 135\">''On A Personal Note''. p. 135</ref> It wasn't enough and she returned to Toronto on her own; for a year she tried to develop her career further while sorting out her feelings.
