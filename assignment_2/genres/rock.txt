He initially shared the band's signature dual [[lead guitar]] roles with band founder [[Duane Allman]], and assumed the solo lead after Allman's death in October of 1971.  As both a singer and composer as well, he was central to the group's greatest commercial success in the mid-1970s and was the writer and vocalist on the Allmans' hit single \"[[Ramblin' Man (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Ramblin' Man]]\". \n\nEarly in his career Betts was best noted for collaboration with Duane Allman,<ref name=Tdrozodowski>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Come%20and%20Go%20Blues_%20The%20Incredi|title=Come and Go Blues: The Incredible Guitarists of the Allman Brothers|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126202416/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Come%20and%20Go%20Blues_%20The%20Incredi|archive-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref> the twosome introducing melodic twin guitar harmony and counterpoint, which, according to ''Guitar World'' \"rewrote the rules for how two rock guitarists can work together, completely scrapping the traditional rhythm/lead roles to stand toe to toe\".<ref name=\"GW July 2009\">{{cite magazine|title=The Allman Brothers Band: The Road Goes on Forever|magazine=Guitar World|date=July 20, 2009|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/the_allman_brothers_band_the_road_goes_on_forever|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202053024/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/the_allman_brothers_band_the_road_goes_on_forever|archive-date=February 2, 2010}}</ref> Betts initially gained renown for his epic [[instrumental]], \"[[In Memory of Elizabeth Reed]]\", from the Band's second album, ''[[Idlewild South]]'', followed by his striking guitar duet-driven \"[[Blue Sky (song)|Blue Sky]]\", which not only was his first band vocal but signaled a dramatic new sound and potential direction for it.  \n\nIn the wake of Duane's death the group indeed followed both Betts' musical direction and band leadership, exploding into commercial success in 1973 upon the introduction of the [[Country music|Country]]-influenced ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', and the chart success of its catchy Betts-written hits, exuberant \"Ramblin' Man\" and the melodic instrumental \"[[Jessica (instrumental)|Jessica]]\".\n\nThe band went through a hiatus in the late 1970s, during which time Betts, like many of the other band members, pursued a solo career and side projects under such names as Great Southern and The Dickey Betts Band.  The Allman Brothers reformed in 1979, with [[Dan Toler]] taking the second guitar role alongside Betts.  In 1982, it broke up a second time, during which break Betts formed the group [[Betts, Hall, Leavell and Trucks]], which lasted until 1984.  A third reformation occurred in 1989, with [[Warren Haynes]] then joining Betts on guitar. \n\nBetts was ousted from the band in 2000 over a conflict regarding his continued drug and alcohol abuse; he never played with them again, nor would he appear with other former band members for reunions or side projects.

In 1967 he formed the Second Coming in Florida with [[Berry Oakley]].

A successful session player, he'd gained a deal with [[Southern soul]] impresario [[Phil Walden]], who planned to back a [[power trio]] featuring Allman.

Signed to RCA Records in 1980, Orrall debuted that year with the album \"Fixation\". His first Top 40 single was \"I Couldn't Say No\", a duet with [[Carlene Carter]]. By 1990, Orrall had found success as a songwriter, having penned Number One singles for [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]] and [[Clay Walker]]. He returned to RCA in 1991 and charted the singles \"Boom! It Was Over\" (#19) and \"A Little Bit of Her Love\" (#31), from his first [[country music]] album, ''[[Flying Colors (Robert Ellis Orrall album)|Flying Colors]]''. Orrall then joined frequent songwriting partner [[Curtis Wright]] in the CMA-nominated duo [[Orrall & Wright]], recording one more album and charting two singles. They split up in 1994, however, and Orrall returned to his solo career, writing singles for [[Reba McEntire]], [[Taylor Swift]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]], as well as producing records for Swift, [[Be Your Own Pet]],  and [[Love and Theft (band)|Love and Theft]]. He also performs and records as an [[indie rock]] musician in the band Monkey Bowl.\n\n==Musical career==\n===Beginnings===\nBorn in [[Winthrop, Massachusetts]], Orrall got his musical start playing in various [[Boston, Massachusetts]], area clubs. He signed with RCA in 1980 as a rock artist. His three RCA albums, ''Fixation'', ''Special Pain'' and ''Contain Yourself'' were supported by band mates Kook Lawry on guitar, Don Walden on bass, David Stefanelli on drums and [[Brian Maes]] on keys with tours opening for [[U2]], [[The Kinks]], and [[NRBQ]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://robertellisorrall.com/|title=Robert Ellis Orrall|website=Robertellisorrall.com}}</ref> Orrall's ''Special Pain'' also produced his first chart single in \"I Couldn't Say No\", a duet with [[Carlene Carter]] (also her first chart hit) which peaked in the Top 40 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"peer\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.peermusic.com/artistpage/Robert_Ellis_Orrall.html|title=Robert Ellis Orrall @ peermusic - The Independent Major|date=25 March 2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020325053836/http://www.peermusic.com/artistpage/Robert_Ellis_Orrall.html|access-date=27 January 2021|archive-date=2002-03-25}}</ref> Carter, like Orrall, would eventually become a country music star in her own right.\n\n===Nashville===\nOrrall eventually gained an interest in country music through such acts as [[Steve Earle]], [[Lyle Lovett]], and [[Foster & Lloyd]].<ref name=\"peer\"/> He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]],<ref name=\"oldies\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Robert-Ellis-Orrall.html|title=Robert Ellis Orrall|website=Oldies.com}}</ref> intending to use his songwriting and record producing skills.<ref name=\"peer\"/> One of his first cuts was [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]]'s \"[[Next to You, Next to Me]]\", which Orrall co-wrote with [[Curtis Wright]].<ref name=\"oldies\"/>\n\nShortly after his song topped the charts, Orrall's publisher BMG Music urged him to perform his songs at The Bluebird Cafe in Nashville. He was then offered a second record deal with RCA.<ref name=\"peer\"/> Titled ''[[Flying Colors (Robert Ellis Orrall album)|Flying Colors]]'', Orrall's first and only solo country album produced three charting singles, including a Top 20 in \"Boom!

Clark initially called his band \"The 20th Anniversary Tribute to the Byrds\" and began performing on the lucrative nostalgia circuit in early 1985.<ref>{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|page=255|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of The Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}</ref> A number of [[Tour promoter|concert promoters]] began to shorten the band's name to \"the Byrds\" in advertisements and promotional material.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher12\"/> As the band continued to tour throughout 1985, their agent decided to shorten the name to \"the Byrds\" permanently, to the displeasure of McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman. Clark eventually discontinued performing with his own \"Byrds\" band, but drummer Clarke continued on with Skip Battin (occasionally with ex-Byrds York and Gene Parsons), forming another \"Byrds\" group, prompting McGuinn, Hillman, and Crosby to go on the road as \"the Byrds\" in an attempt to establish a claim to the rights to the name. Their effort failed this time; Clark was not included in the reunion, primarily because of his involvement with the act that didn't include them. Crosby finally secured rights to the name in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Terry Jones|title=Younger Than Yesterday: Biography|publisher=terryjonesrogers.com|url=http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|access-date=April 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716212021/http://www.terryjonesrogers.com/The_Byrds.php|archive-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Varga|first=George|title=CD Proves to Everything There Is a Season| date = September 24, 2006 | work =[[The San Diego Union-Tribune|San Diego Union-Tribune]]|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060924/news_1a24byrds.html|access-date=April 25, 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121018221327/http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060924/news_1a24byrds.html | archive-date = October 18, 2012 | url-status = dead}}</ref>\n\nDespite the critical success of ''So Rebellious a Lover'', which led to several TV appearances (including ''[[Nashville Now]]''), Clark was increasingly afflicted with serious health problems, including [[ulcers]] and [[alcohol dependence]]. In 1988, he underwent surgery to remove a malignant ulcer.\n\nA period of abstinence and recovery followed until [[Tom Petty]] covered \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\" on ''[[Full Moon Fever]]'' (1989), yielding a windfall of royalties from the album (which peaked at No. 3 in the United States) to Clark. Flush with money, he began to neglect his professional obligations. Although the circumstances remain nebulous (with Carla Olson citing alleged financial improprieties), the binge also precipitated his final break-up with Terri Messina, who had had a two-decade [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with Clark.<ref>{{cite book|last=Einarson|first=John|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|year=2005|publisher=Backbeat Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-87930-793-5|page=286}}</ref>\n\nDuring this period, The Byrds set aside their differences long enough to appear together at their induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in January 1991, at which the original lineup performed several songs together, including Clark's \"I'll Feel a Whole Lot Better\".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Byrds Setlist at Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony #6|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-byrds/1991/waldorf-astoria-hotel-new-york-ny-4bc56ba2.html|website=setlist.fm|access-date=July 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\nClark's health continued to decline as his substance abuse accelerated, and he was diagnosed with throat cancer in early 1991.

He scored three US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hits in the 1980s as a solo artist, and later became tenor vocalist in the country music band [[BlackHawk]] in the 1990s. In addition, Van co-wrote several singles for other artists, such as [[Restless Heart]]. Stephenson died of [[melanoma]] in 2001.\n\n==Biography==\nStephenson was born in [[Hamilton, Ohio]], but moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], when he was ten years old, and he played in [[garage band]]s as a teenager. He graduated from [[seminary]] school and wrote songs on the side in the 1970s; his first chart hit as a songwriter was for [[Crystal Gayle]], who cracked the US country Top Ten with his \"Your Kisses Will\" in 1979. Stephenson went on to write hits for [[Kenny Rogers]], [[Dan Seals]], [[Janie Fricke]], and [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]. Partnering with Dave Robbins, Stephenson wrote a string of hits for [[Restless Heart]] and would continue to work with Robbins later in his career.\n\nStephenson landed a recording contract of his own with Handshake Records, through which he released his first solo album, ''China Girl'', in 1981.  He later signed with [[MCA Records|MCA]], and his second album, ''Righteous Anger'', was released in 1984.  He scored big on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] charts with \"Modern Day Delilah\" peaking at No.&nbsp;22, and a second hit, \"What the Big Girls Do\", peaked at No.&nbsp;45.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p20751|pure_url=yes}} Billboard Singles], Allmusic.com</ref> ''Righteous Anger'' charted at No.&nbsp;54 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p20751|pure_url=yes}} Billboard], Allmusic.com</ref> but his follow-up 1986 disc, ''Suspicious Heart'', did not chart, nor did its lead single, \"We're Doing Alright.\" It also included two songs featured on movie soundtracks: \"Make It Glamorous\" from the 1984 film ''[[The Wild Life (film)|The Wild Life]]'' and \"No Secrets\" from the 1985 film ''[[Secret Admirer (film)|Secret Admirer]]''. Stephenson returned to songwriting duties until the early 1990s, when he became one-third of [[BlackHawk]], a successful country group, through the end of the decade.

As a solo artist, he scored an international hit with the song \"[[Rio (Michael Nesmith song)|Rio]]\" (1977). He often played a custom-built [[Gretsch]] [[12-string guitar|12-string]] electric guitar with the Monkees and afterwards.\n\nIn 1974, Nesmith founded [[Pacific Arts Corporation|Pacific Arts]], a multimedia production and distribution company, through which he helped pioneer the [[music video]] format, winning the first [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]] for his hour-long  comedy/variety program, ''[[Elephant Parts]]'' (1981).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=&field_nominee_work_value=&year=1981&genre=18|title=Past Winners Search|work=The GRAMMYs|date=April 30, 2017}}</ref> He created one of the first American television programs dedicated to music videos, ''[[PopClips]]'', which aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in 1980, and was soon after approached to help develop the [[MTV]] network, though he declined.

She took temporary jobs ranging from clerical work to graphic design, eventually attaining the position of executive secretary at Texas Bank and Trust. When Nesmith was 13, his mother invented the typewriter correction fluid later known commercially as [[Liquid Paper]]. Over the next 25 years, she built the Liquid Paper Corporation into an international company, which she sold to [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] in 1979 for $47.5 million.

He enrolled in [[San Antonio College]], where he met [[John London]] and began a musical collaboration. They won the first San Antonio College talent award, performing a mixture of standard folk songs and a few of Nesmith's original songs. Nesmith began to write more songs and poetry, then he moved to Los Angeles and began singing in folk clubs around the city.

In October 1965, Nesmith's confident, carefree and laid-back manner impressed the producers and he landed the role as the wool hat-wearing guitar player \"Mike\" in the show, which required real-life musical talent for writing, instrument playing, singing, and performing in live concerts as part of the Monkees band.<ref name=\"Sandoval, Andrew 2001\">Sandoval, Andrew.

His \"[[Different Drum]]\" and \"Some of Shelly's Blues\" were later recorded by [[Linda Ronstadt]] and the [[Stone Poneys]] in 1967 and 1968, respectively. \"Pretty Little Princess\", written in 1965, was recorded by [[Frankie Laine]] and released as a single in 1968 on [[ABC Records]].{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}  Later, \"Some of Shelly's Blues\" and \"Propinquity (I've Just Begun to Care)\" were made popular by the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] on their 1970 album ''[[Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy]]''.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\n===The Monkees===\n\n[[File:The Monkees 1966.JPG|left|upright|thumb|The Monkees in 1966 (Nesmith at bottom right)]]\n\nFrom 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith -- along with [[Micky Dolenz]], [[Peter Tork]], and [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]] -- was a member of the television pop-rock band [[the Monkees]], created for the television [[The Monkees (TV series)|situation comedy of the same name]]. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing nonchalant when he auditioned.<ref name=\":0\"/> He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a [[knit cap|wool hat]] to keep his hair out of his eyes; producers [[Bob Rafelson]] and [[Bert Schneider]] remembered the \"wool hat guy\" and called Nesmith back.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nOnce he was cast, [[Screen Gems]] bought his songs so they could be used in the show. Many of the songs Nesmith wrote for the Monkees, such as \"[[The Girl I Knew Somewhere]]\", \"[[Mary, Mary (song)|Mary, Mary]]\",<ref name=\":0\"/> and \"[[Listen to the Band (song)|Listen to the Band]]\" became minor hits. One song he wrote, \"You Just May Be the One\", is in mixed meter, interspersing 5/4 bars into an otherwise 4/4 structure.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n[[File:The Monkees May 1967.jpg|thumb|Nesmith (center) with [[The Monkees (TV series)|the Monkees]] in 1967]]\n\nEven before Colgems and [[Don Kirshner]]'s surreptitious release of the Monkees 2nd LP, without the knowledge or consent of the four musician-actors, they came to be frustrated by their studio-manufactured \"bubblegum\" image. Within weeks of the release of ''[[More of the Monkees]]'', Nesmith lobbied successfully with the group's creators, Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, that the Monkees be allowed to play their instruments on future records. \nDuring a group meeting with Kirshner and Colgems lawyer Herb Moelis, in a suite at the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]], each actor received a $250k royalties check, yet Nesmith still threatened to quit. Moelis rebuked him, \"You'd better read your contract\". Nesmith defiantly punched a hole in the wall, declaring to Moelis, \"That could have been your face, motherfucker!\" Weeks later, due to a breach of (verbal) agreement over the next single release, which was promised to Nesmith by Rafelson & Schneider, Nesmith led the charge in completely ousting musical supervisor Don Kirshner, effectively giving the four youths complete artistic and production control of their output, and the group finally worked as a true 4-man rock group on 1967's ''[[Headquarters (the Monkees album)|Headquarters]]'', despite Jones & Dolenz having very limited instrumental skills, studio time being pricey and retakes costly.<ref name=\"Sandoval, Andrew 2001\"/>\n\nDuring the band's first independent press conference, Nesmith called their 2nd LP, ''[[More of the Monkees]]'' \"probably the worst record in the history of the world\", partly due to rushed, shoddy studio engineering. The band took a hit to its artistic credibility when fans learned the four had not played all the instruments on the first 2 LPs. But still sales continued to be profitable. ''Headquarters'' sold 2 million copies, down 2 million units from its predecessor, but still reached the number 1 spot on Billboard, falling only to ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' a week later and remaining #2 all through the entire 1967 [[Summer of Love]].<ref name=\"Sandoval, Andrew 2001\"/>\n\nFor the remaining five Monkees LPs, ironically, the original Kirshner formula of hired studio musicians & songwriters again became the norm, although Nesmith, Tork, Dolenz and Jones contributed about 50% of the original compositions, Nesmith the majority of those.<ref name=\"Sandoval, Andrew 2001\"/>\nBy the end of the Monkees run, Nesmith was withholding many of his original song ideas from Monkees albums, planning to release them in his post-Monkees solo career. \nNesmith's last contractual Monkees commitment was a commercial for [[Kool-Aid]] and [[Nerf]] balls in April 1970 (fittingly, the spot ends with Nesmith frowning and saying, \"Enerf's enerf!\"). As the band's sales declined, Nesmith asked to be released from his contract, despite it costing him: \"I had three years left ... at $150,000 [equivalent to $1.16 million in 2022] a year.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} He remained in a financial bind until 1980, when he received his inheritance from his mother's estate. In a 1980 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'', he said of that time: \"I had to start telling little tales to the tax man while they were putting tags on the furniture.\"{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n====Return to the Monkees====\nNesmith did not participate in the Monkees' 20th anniversary reunion,<ref name=\":0\"/> due to contractual obligations with his production company, but he did appear during an encore with the three other Monkees at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] on September 7, 1986.

London played on some of the earliest pre-Monkees, Nesmith 45s, as well as numerous Monkees sessions, and had 45s produced by Nesmith for the [[Dot Records|Dot label]] in 1969. Ware wanted Nesmith to put together a band. Nesmith's interest hinged on noted [[pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]] player [[Red Rhodes|Orville \"Red\" Rhodes]]; their musical partnership continued until Rhodes's death in 1995. The new band was christened Michael Nesmith and the First National Band and recorded three albums for [[RCA Records]], the first two issued in 1970 and the third released in 1971.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nNesmith's First National Band is now considered a pioneer of country-rock music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.real.com/music/artist/Michael_Nesmith/ |title=Michael Nesmith - Country Rock - Rock/Pop - Music|website=Uk.real.com |access-date=May 14, 2010}}</ref> Nesmith wrote most of the songs for the band and he is considered one of the trailblazers of [[country rock]].<ref>[[Liner notes]] from the CD ''Hillbilly Fever, Volume 5'' released by [[Rhino Entertainment]] in 1995.</ref> He also had moderate commercial success with the First National Band.

Two more singles charted (\"Nevada Fighter\" made number 70 ''Billboard'', number 73 Cashbox, and number 67 Canada, and \"Propinquity\" reached number 95 Cashbox), and the first two LPs charted in the lower regions of the'' Billboard'' album chart.

Nesmith then recorded ''[[And the Hits Just Keep on Comin']]'', featuring only him on guitar and Red Rhodes on pedal steel.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nNesmith then became more heavily involved in producing, working on [[Iain Matthews]]'s album ''[[Valley Hi]]'' and [[Bert Jansch]]'s ''[[L.A.

It featured a number of artists produced by Nesmith, including Garland Frady and Red Rhodes. The staff band at Countryside also helped Nesmith on his next, and last, RCA Victor album, ''[[Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash]]''.  Countryside folded when [[David Geffen]] replaced Holzman, as Countryside was unnecessary in Geffen's eyes.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Nesmith briefly collaborated as a songwriter with [[Linda Hargrove (songwriter)|Linda Hargrove]], resulting in the tune \"[[I've Never Loved Anyone More]]\", a hit for [[Lynn Anderson]] and recorded by many others, as well as the songs \"Winonah\" and \"If You Will Walk With Me\", both of which were recorded by Hargrove.

After establishing himself in the [[Music of Detroit#Hip hop|Detroit hip hop]] scene, he broke through into mainstream success with a [[rap rock]] sound before shifting his performance style to [[country rock]]. A self-taught musician, he has said he can play every instrument in his backing band and has overseen production on all but two of his albums.\n\nKid Rock started his music career as a rapper and DJ, releasing his debut album ''[[Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast]]'' (1990), on [[Jive Records]]. His subsequent independent releases ''[[The Polyfuze Method]]'' (1993) and ''[[Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp]]'' (1996) saw him developing a more distinctive style, which was fully realized on his breakthrough album ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'' (1998), which sold 14 million copies. This album and its follow-up, ''[[Cocky (album)|Cocky]]'' (2001), were noted for blending elements of hip-hop, country and rock.\n\nHis most successful single from that time period, \"[[Cowboy (Kid Rock song)|Cowboy]]\" (1999), is considered a pioneering song in the [[country rap]] genre. His best-selling singles overall are \"[[Picture (song)|Picture]]\" (2002) and \"[[All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)|All Summer Long]]\" (2008). Starting with his 2007 album ''[[Rock n Roll Jesus]]'', his musical output has tended to be in the country rock style. Politically, Ritchie is a vocal supporter of the U.S. [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and holds conservative views.\n\n==Early life==\nKid Rock was born Robert James Ritchie in [[Romeo, Michigan]], on January 17, 1971, the son of Susan and William \"Bill\" Ritchie (1941\u20132024),<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Ritchie, former Sterling Heights auto dealer and father of Kid Rock, dies in Florida |url=https://www.freep.com/story/entertainment/music/brian-mccollum/2024/02/16/bill-ritchie-father-of-kid-rock-and-ex-sterling-heights-auto-dealer-dies/72633949007/ |website=www.freep.com}}</ref> who owned multiple car dealerships.<ref name=\"Biography\">{{cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/kid-rock-251986|title=Kid Rock|website=Biography.com|access-date=October 13, 2017|archive-date=October 13, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013224846/https://www.biography.com/people/kid-rock-251986|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Allmusic\"/><ref name=\"cowboysindians\"/> He was raised in his father's large home on extensive property,<ref name=\"Biography\"/><ref name=Freep2016>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2016/11/04/kid-rock-macomb-county-house/93299716/|title=Kid Rock's posh childhood home listed in Macomb County for $1.3M|website=Freep.com|access-date=November 3, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107142821/http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/macomb/2016/11/04/kid-rock-macomb-county-house/93299716/|url-status=live}}</ref> which included an [[apple orchard]] and barnyard for their horses.<ref name=\"The Independent\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-kid-rock-musician-age-37-870596.html|title=My Secret Life: Kid Rock Musician (age 37)|last=Philby|first=Charlotte|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=November 30, 2010|location=London|date=July 19, 2008|archive-date=March 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324122407/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-kid-rock-musician-age-37-870596.html|url-status=live}}</ref> He attended [[Romeo High School]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.dailytribune.com/2011/04/22/kid-rock-visits-romeo-high-school-donates-money/amp/ | title=Kid Rock visits Romeo High School, donates money | date=April 22, 2011 }}</ref> His younger sister, [[Jill Ritchie]], is an actress.<ref name=Heartbreak/> In the 1980s, Kid Rock became interested in [[hip hop]], began to [[breakdance]], and taught himself how to rap and DJ while performing in talent shows in and around [[Detroit]].<ref name=Biography/><ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist |id=kid-rock-p15074/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Kid Rock \u2013 Biography|last=Huey|first=Jeff |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=November 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early career, signing with Jive Records, and ''Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast'' (1988\u20131991)===\nKid Rock began his professional music career as a member of a [[hip hop music]] group called the Beast Crew in the late 1980s.<ref name=Biography/> During this time, he met rapper [[D-Nice]].

He explained in a 2000 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, \"I've got a lot of faith in people. Whether it's some kid with a trust fund that people tease because he's got a trust fund, you know.

His songs have been covered by [[Dolly Parton]], [[Hal Ketchum]], [[Timothy B. Schmit]] of [[the Eagles]], [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Sherrie Austin]], [[Tammy Cochran]] and various [[Independent artist|indie artists]]. His music has been featured on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[FOX]], [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] and in [[USA Today]], ''[[Billboard]]'', ''[[Texas Highways]]'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]''. His discography includes work with [[Vince Gill]], [[Radney Foster]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Steve Lukather]] ([[Toto (band)|Toto]]), [[Stan Lynch]] ([[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]]), [[Dann Huff]] ([[Carrie Underwood]], [[Keith Urban]]) and [[David Z (producer)|David Z]] ([[Prince]], [[Jonny Lang]]).\n\n==Early career==\nDavis began his career in 1990 by playing the [[Dallas]] bar scene. In 1996, he was encouraged to move to [[Nashville]] by Grammy Award-winner, [[Rodney Crowell]]. In 1998, Davis signed with [[Warner/Chappell Music]] where he wrote songs for major-label artists. The following year, he signed an artist development deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]]. After six months, the label considered the recordings to be too left of center and eventually shelved the project. Those self-produced recordings caught the ear of hit producer, Dann Huff, who later signed Davis to his new subsidiary label under [[Sony Records]].\n\n==2002\u20132007==\nIn 2002, Davis signed with [[MCA Records]] where fellow Texas singer-songwriter, [[Radney Foster]], came on board as producer. Davis also signed a new publishing deal with [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] Publishing. When MCA decided to not release the record, Davis returned to his Texas roots and signed with the indie label, [[Palo Duro Records]]. After his debut album received a national release in 2006, ''[[USA Today]]'' called his song, The Bottom Line, \"One of the most intriguing tracks from the present, past and near future.\" The album also caught the attention of renowned music critic, [[Robert K. Oermann]] \u2013 \"I\u2019m a huge fan of this man\u2019s album. Its second single sizzles with zesty rhythm, yelping vocals, sidewinder guitar and a ridiculously catchy melody. The major-label 'stars' on [[Music Row]] have nothing on this guy.\"\n\n==2008\u20132013==\nIn 2008, Davis released the patriotic single, The Boy I Left Behind, with fellow Texas singer-songwriter, [[Deryl Dodd]]. It became the official theme song for The American Fallen Soldiers Project.\n\nIn 2009, Davis was the Texas statewide voice for [[Energy Future Holdings|TXU]] Energy. That same year, he released \"Demos From the Vault (1999\u20132009).\" The double album features guest appearances by [[Vince Gill]], Radney Foster, [[Jon Randall]], [[Steve Lukather]] (Toto) and Stan Lynch (The Heartbreakers).\n\nIn 2010, Davis was awarded Song of the Year by the [[American Cancer Society]].\n\nIn 2012, Davis was a featured artist on Troubadour TX, a national TV show following the careers of Texas singer-songwriters.\n\nIn 2013, LSA Burger Co. (named after his top 40 dance hall track, Lone Star Attitude) opened in Denton, TX. A second location is in The Colony, TX.\nThere are also two airport stores named after Lone Star Attitude located at [[DFW International Airport]].\n\n==2014\u2013present==\nIn 2014, Davis released the album, \"Last Night's Dinner Party.\" \n\nIn 2016, Davis collaborated with CMA Song of the Year nominee, [[Max T. Barnes]], on several singles and produced eight music videos.\n\nIn 2018, Davis released the album, \"New Wind Blowing.\" \n\nIn 2020, Davis released the EP, \"The Ride.\" \n\nDavis is currently working on a new band project with Stan Lynch (Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Don Henley) called The Speaker Wars.\n\n==Discography==\n;Albums\n* ''Jon Christopher Davis Live'' (2005)\n* ''Jon Christopher Davis'' (2006)\n* ''Demos from the Vault (1999\u20132009)'' \n* ''Last Night's Dinner Party'' (2014)\n* ''New Wind Blowing'' (2018)\n* ''The Ride'' (2020)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* https://www.jonchristopherdavis.com/\n*[http://www.facebook.com/jonchristopherdavismusic Facebook page]\n* https://www.instagram.com/jonchristopherdavis/\n*http://countrymusic.about.com/od/cdreviewsmz/fr/jcdavis.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415180145/http://countrymusic.about.com/od/cdreviewsmz/fr/jcdavis.htm |date=April 15, 2013 }}\n*http://www.allmusic.com/album/jon-christopher-davis-r849749/review\n*http://artreach.smugmug.com/Community-Programs/Sept-2010-Texas-Music-Project/13601132_PKsRW#992217115_rSehu\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Davis, Jon Christopher}}\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1968 births]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

It was her first foray into [[traditional jazz]] since her sessions with Jerry Wexler and her records with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, but this time with an intimate [[jazz]] [[musical ensemble|combo]]. The album was a quiet affair for Ronstadt, giving few interviews and making only one television performance as a promotion. It reached number 2 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart but peaked at number 166 on the main Billboard album chart. Not having the mass distribution that [[Warner Music Group]] gave her, ''Hummin' To Myself'' had sold over 75,000 copies in the U.S. as of 2010. It also achieved some critical acclaim from the jazz cognoscenti.<ref name=\"JazzTimes2\" />\n\n=== \"Trio\" recordings ===\n{{quote box\n| width=25%\n| align=left\n| quote=When (we) sang, it was a beautiful and different sound I've never heard before.

Unfortunately, the attempt did not pan out. Ronstadt later remarked that not too many people were in control at the time and everyone was too involved with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the recordings were included on the singers' respective solo recordings over the next few years.) This concept album was put on the back burner for almost ten years.\n\nIn January 1986, the three eventually did make their way into the recording studio, where they spent the next several months working. The result, ''[[Trio (1987 album)|Trio]]'', which they had conceived ten years earlier, was released in March 1987. It was a considerable hit, holding the number 1 position on Billboard's Country Albums chart for five weeks running and hitting the Top 10 on the pop side also. Selling over three million copies in the U.S. and winning them a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], it produced four Top Ten Country singles including \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\" which hit number 1. The album was also a nominee for overall Album of the Year, in the company of Michael Jackson, [[U2]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], and [[Whitney Houston]].\n\nIn 1994, the three performers recorded a follow-up to ''Trio''. As was the case with their aborted 1978 effort, conflicting schedules and competing priorities delayed the album's release indefinitely. Ronstadt, who had already paid for studio time{{nsmdns}}and owed her record company a finished album{{nsmdns}}removed Parton's individual tracks at Parton's request, kept Harris's vocals, and produced a number of the recordings, which she subsequently released on her 1995 return to country rock, the album ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]''.\n\nHowever, in 1999, Ronstadt, Parton, and Harris agreed to release the ''[[Trio II]]'' album, as was originally recorded in 1994. It included an ethereal cover of Neil Young's \"[[After The Gold Rush (song)|After The Gold Rush]]\" which became a popular music video. The effort was certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold) and won them a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals]] for the track. Ronstadt co-produced the album with [[George Massenburg]] and the three women also received a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album]].\n\n===''Canciones de Mi Padre''===\n\n{{main article|Canciones de Mi Padre}}\n\nAt the end of 1987, Ronstadt released ''Canciones de Mi Padre'', an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she has described as \"world class songs\". Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful; it shows Ronstadt in full Mexican regalia. Her musical arranger was mariachi musician [[Rub\u00e9n Fuentes]].\n\nThese ''[[canciones]]'' were a big part of Ronstadt's family tradition and musical roots. In January 1946, the [[University of Arizona]] published a booklet by [[Luisa Espinel]] entitled ''Canciones de mi Padre''.<ref name=\"MyFathersSongs\">{{Cite web |last=Griffith |first=James S. |title=The Singing Ronstadts and Canciones de mi Padre \u2013 A Musical Family |url=http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/music/cancintr.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615124049/http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/music/cancintr.html |archive-date=June 15, 2007 |access-date=May 30, 2007 |website=Tucson'sRonstadtFamily}}</ref> Luisa Espinel, Ronstadt's aunt, was an international singer in the 1920s and 1930s. Espinel's father was Fred Ronstadt, Linda Ronstadt's grandfather, and the songs she had learned, transcribed, and published were some of the ones he had brought with him from [[Sonora]]. Ronstadt researched and extracted from the favorites she had learned from her father Gilbert and she called her album by the same name as her aunt's booklet and as a tribute to her father and his family. Though not fully bilingual, she has a fairly good command of the Spanish language, allowing her to sing Latin American songs with little discernible U.S. accent; Ronstadt has often identified herself as Mexican-American.<ref name=\"MexAm\">{{Cite web |title=American Way |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artamway.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808111245/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artamway.htm |archive-date=August 8, 2007 |access-date=May 7, 2007 |website=Linda Ronstadt's New Old Flame- Mexican Music}}</ref> Her formative years were spent with her father's side of the family.<ref name=\"rollingstone\">{{Cite magazine |last=Herbst |first=Peter |title=The Rolling Stone Interview |url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022112308/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intrs78.htm |archive-date=October 22, 2006 |access-date=October 19, 2006 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> In fact, in 1976, Ronstadt had collaborated with her father to write and compose a traditional Mexican folk ballad, ''\"Lo siento mi vida\"''{{snds}}a song that she included on ''Hasten Down the Wind''. Ronstadt has also credited Mexican singer [[Lola Beltr\u00e1n]] as an influence on her own singing style, and she recalls how a frequent guest to the Ronstadt home, [[Lalo Guerrero|Eduardo \"Lalo\" Guerrero]], father of [[Chicano]] music, would often serenade her as a child.<ref name=\"AARP-07\" />\n\n''Canciones de Mi Padre'' won Ronstadt a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican-American Performance]]. In 2001, it was certified double-platinum by the RIAA for shipments of over 2&nbsp;million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling non-English-language album in U.S. music history. The album and later theatrical stage show served as a benchmark of the Latin cultural renaissance in North America.\n\n{{quote box\n| width=25%\n| align=left\n| quote=(I obtained) enough clout and ... after years and years of making commercial records, I was entitled to experiment ... the success of the (Nelson Riddle albums) ... entitled me to try the Mexican stuff.\n|source=\u2014Linda Ronstadt<ref name=\"Windy\" />}}\n\nRonstadt produced and performed a theatrical stage show, also titled ''Canciones de mi Padre'', in concert halls across the U.S. and Latin America to both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences. These performances were later released on DVD. Ronstadt elected to return to the Broadway stage, four years after she performed in ''La boh\u00e8me'', for a limited-run engagement. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Great Performances'' aired the stage show during its annual fund drives and the show was a hit with audiences, earning Ronstadt a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance in a Variety or Music Program]].\n\nRonstadt recorded two additional albums of Latin music in the early 1990s. Their promotion, like most of her albums in the 1990s, was a quieter affair, with Ronstadt making only a limited number of appearances to promote them. They were not nearly as successful as ''Canciones De Mi Padre'', but were critically acclaimed in some circles. In 1991, she released ''[[Mas Canciones]]'', a follow-up to the first ''Canciones''. For this album, she won a Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album]]. The following year, she stepped outside of the mariachi genre and decided to record well-known Afro-Cuban songs. This album was titled ''[[Frenes\u00ed (album)|Frenes\u00ed]]''. Like her two previous Latin recordings ventures, it won Ronstadt a Grammy Award, this time for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album|Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album]].\n\nIn 1991, Ronstadt acted in the lead role of archangel San Miguel in ''La Pastorela'', or ''A Shephard's Tale'', a musical filmed at ''[[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan Bautista]]''. It was written and directed by [[Luis Valdez]]. The production was part of the PBS ''Great Performances'' series.\n\nIn December 2020, it was announced that ''Canciones de Mi Padre'' had been inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |title=GRAMMY Hall Of Fame Welcomes 2021 Inductions: A Tribe Called Quest, Billie Holiday, Journey, Patti Smith, Bruce Springsteen And More |date=December 21, 2020 |url=https://www.grammy.com/press-releases/grammy-hall-fame-2021-inductions-welcomes-recordings-tribe-called-quest-billie-holiday-journey-linda |publisher=Recording Academy |access-date=February 16, 2021 |archive-date=March 1, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301191303/https://www.grammy.com/press-releases/grammy-hall-fame-2021-inductions-welcomes-recordings-tribe-called-quest-billie-holiday-journey-linda |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Returning to the contemporary music scene===\nBy the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Riddle and her surprise hit mariachi recordings, Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again. In 1987, she made a return to the top of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart with \"[[Somewhere Out There (James Horner song)|Somewhere Out There]]\", which peaked at number 2 in March.<ref name=bronson /> Featured in the animated film ''[[An American Tail]]'', the sentimental duet with James Ingram was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]]. The song also received a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling gold single in the U.S.{{snds}}one of the last 45s ever to do so. It was also accompanied by a popular music video. On the heels of this success, [[Steven Spielberg]] asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', which was titled \"[[Dreams to Dream]]\". Although \"Dreams to Dream\" failed to achieve the success of \"Somewhere Out There\", the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.\n\nIn 1989, Ronstadt released a mainstream pop album and several popular singles. ''[[Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind]]'' became one of the singer's most successful albums{{snds}}in production, arrangements, sales, and critical acclaim. It became Ronstadt's tenth Top 10 album on the ''Billboard'' chart, reaching number 7 and being certified triple-platinum<ref name=RIAAsearch /> (over three million copies sold in the U.S.). The album also received Grammy Award nominations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Artist Linda Ronstadt |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/linda-ronstadt |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200102051512/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/linda-ronstadt |archive-date=January 2, 2020 |access-date=October 23, 2018 |website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards}}</ref> Ronstadt included New Orleans soul singer Aaron Neville on several of the album's songs.\n\nRonstadt incorporated the sounds of the [[Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir]], [[Tower of Power]] horns, the Skywalker Symphony, and numerous musicians. It included the duets with Aaron Neville, \"[[Don't Know Much]]\" (''Billboard'' Hot 100 number 2 hit, Christmas 1989<ref name=bronson />) and \"[[All My Life (Linda Ronstadt song)|All My Life]]\" (''Billboard'' Hot 100 number 11 hit), both of which were long-running number 1 Adult Contemporary hits. The duets earned several Grammy Award nominations. The duo won both the 1989 and 1990 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. Ronstadt's last known live Grammy Award appearance was in 1990 when she and Neville performed \"Don't Know Much\" together on the telecast.<ref name=kqed /> (\"Whenever I sing with a different artist, I can get things out of my voice that I can't do by myself\", Ronstadt reflected in 2007. \"I can do things with Aaron that I can't do alone.\")<ref>Thibodeaux, Ron (February 11, 2007). \"Home Grown\".

It included New Age arrangements such as the lead single \"[[Heartbeats Accelerating]]\" as well as the self-penned title track and featured the glass harmonica. It was her first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at number 92 in Billboard, whereas 1995's ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]'' was Ronstadt's much-heralded return to country-rock and included her version of [[Tom Petty]]'s classic hit \"[[The Waiting (song)|The Waiting]]\". The single's rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, \"Walk On\", returned Ronstadt to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983. An album track entitled \"The Blue Train\" charted 10 weeks in ''Billboard''{{'}}s Adult Contemporary Top 40. This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching number 75. Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog. Ronstadt was nominated for three [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1993|Lo Nuestro Awards]] in 1993: Female Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, Female Tropical/Salsa Artist of the Year, and her version of the song \"Perfidia\" was also listed for Tropical/Salsa Song of the Year.<ref name=\"billboardmag\">{{Cite magazine |last=Lannert |first=John |date=March 30, 1993 |title=Secada Lead Latin Noms Following Grammy Win |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0w8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 |url-status=live |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=105 |issue=10 |page=10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103033249/https://books.google.com/books?id=0w8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10&dq=no+se+tu+luis+miguel&hl=es-419&sa=X&ei=_PzlUJ3QOcKsjALfhYEQ&ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=no%20se%20tu%20luis%20miguel&f=false |archive-date=January 3, 2016 |access-date=January 3, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Ronstadt produced ''[[Dedicated to the One I Love (album)|Dedicated to the One I Love]]'', an album of classic rock and roll songs reinvented as lullabies. The album reached number 78 in ''Billboard'' and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children]].\n\nIn 1998, Ronstadt released ''[[We Ran]]'', her first album in over two years. The album harkened back to Ronstadt's country-rock and folk-rock heyday. She returned to her rock 'n' roll roots with vivid interpretations of songs by [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[John Hiatt]]. The recording was produced by [[Glyn Johns]]. A commercial failure, the album stood at 57,897 copies sold at the time of its deletion in 2008. It is the poorest-selling studio album in Ronstadt's Elektra/Asylum catalog. ''We Ran'' did not chart any singles but it was well received by critics.\n\nDespite the lack of success of ''We Ran'', Ronstadt kept moving towards this adult rock exploration. In the summer of 1999, she released the album ''[[Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions]]'', a folk-rock-oriented project with Emmylou Harris. It earned a nomination for the Grammy Award for the Best Contemporary Folk Album and made the Top 10 of ''Billboard''{{'}}s Country Albums chart. Still in print as of December 2016, it has sold 223,255 copies per [[Nielsen SoundScan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\nAlso in 1999, Ronstadt went back to her concert roots when she performed with the Eagles and Jackson Browne at [[Staples Center]]'s 1999 New Year's Eve celebration kicking off the December 31 end-of-the-millennium festivities. As Staples Center Senior Vice President and general manager Bobby Goldwater said, \"It was our goal to present a spectacular event as a sendoff to the 20th century\", and \"Eagles, Jackson Browne, and Linda Ronstadt are three of the most popular acts of the century.

The fulfillment of this contract commenced with the release of ''[[A Merry Little Christmas (Linda Ronstadt album)|A Merry Little Christmas]]'', her first holiday collection, which includes rare choral works, the somber Joni Mitchell song \"[[River (Joni Mitchell song)|River]]\", and a rare recorded duet with the late [[Rosemary Clooney]] on Clooney's signature song, \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\".\n\nSince leaving Warner Music, Ronstadt has gone on to release one album each under [[Verve Records|Verve]] and [[Vanguard Records]].\n\n{{quote box\n| width=25%\n| align=left\n| quote=Your musical soul is like facets of a jewel, and you stick out one facet at a time ...

It was an album of roots music incorporating pop, Cajun, and early-20th-century music and released on the Vanguard Records label. But ''Adieu False Heart'' was a commercial failure, peaking at number 146 in the U.S. despite her touring for the final time that year. It was the last time Linda Ronstadt would record an album, having begun to lose her singing ability as a result of a degenerative condition later determined to be progressive supranuclear palsy, but initially diagnosed as Parkinson's disease, in December 2012. ''Adieu False Heart'', recorded in [[Louisiana]], features a cast of local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of [[the Red Stick Ramblers]], Sam Broussard of [[the Mamou Playboys]], [[Dirk Powell]], and [[Joel Savoy]], as well as an array of Nashville musicians: fiddler [[Stuart Duncan]], mandolinist [[Sam Bush]], and guitarist [[Bryan Sutton]].

He was the lead singer and lyricist of the rock band [[Led Zeppelin]] from its founding in 1968 until their breakup in 1980. Since then, he has had a successful solo career, sometimes collaborating with other artists such as [[Alison Krauss]]. Regarded by many as one of the greatest singers in rock music, he is known for his flamboyant persona and raw stage performances.\n\nPlant was born and raised in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] area of England, where, after leaving [[grammar school]], he briefly trained as a chartered accountant before leaving home at 16 years old to concentrate on singing with a series of local blues bands, including [[Band of Joy]] with [[John Bonham]]. In 1968, he was invited by [[Peter Grant (music manager)|Peter Grant]] and [[Jimmy Page]] to join [[The Yardbirds]], which Grant and Page were attempting to keep going after it had broken up (a breakup that became public knowledge by early July at the latest<ref>Rock, John J. ''Rolling Stone'' 6 July 1968</ref>). The new version of The Yardbirds changed their name to Led Zeppelin, and from the late 1960s to the end of the 1970s, the band enjoyed considerable success.\n\nPlant developed a compelling image as a charismatic rock-and-roll frontman, comparable to other '70s contemporaries such as [[Mick Jagger]] of [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[the Who]], and [[Jim Morrison]] of [[the Doors]]. After Led Zeppelin dissolved in 1980, Plant continued to perform and record continuously on a variety of solo and group projects. His first two solo albums, ''[[Pictures at Eleven]]'' (1982) and ''[[The Principle of Moments]]'' (1983), each reached the top ten on the Billboard albums chart. With his band [[The Honeydrippers]] he scored a top-ten single hit with a remake of \"[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]]\", which featured former Led Zeppelin bandmate Jimmy Page on guitar. Solo album ''[[Now and Zen]]'' (1988) was certified 3\u00d7 Platinum and is Plant's biggest-selling solo album to date. In the 1990s, another reunion project called [[Page and Plant]] released two albums and earned a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] in 1998 for \"[[Most High (song)|Most High]]\". In 2007, Plant began a collaboration with bluegrass artist Alison Krauss, releasing the album ''[[Raising Sand]]'', which won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 2009 and produced the hit song \"[[Please Read the Letter]]\", which won the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] the same year. In 2010, he revived the [[Band of Joy]] (which shared its name with an early band he performed with in the 1960s), and in 2012 formed a new band, the Sensational Space Shifters, followed by a reunion with Alison Krauss in 2019.\n\nIn 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=Hall/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Plant as one of the 100 best singers of all time (2008);<ref name=\"ROLLS\">[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/robert-plant-20101202 100 Greatest Singers Of All Time: Robert Plant] ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.

He grew up close to the Welsh border and would often take summer trips to [[Snowdonia]]. Plant bought a Welsh sheep farm in 1973, and began taking Welsh lessons and looking into the mythology of the land (such as [[Black Book of Carmarthen]], [[Book of Taliesin]], etc.) Plant's first son, Karac, was named after the Welsh warrior [[Caratacus]]. The song \"[[Bron-Y-Aur Stomp]]\" is named after the 18th-century Welsh cottage [[Bron-Yr-Aur]], owned by a friend of his father; it later inspired the song \"[[Bron-Yr-Aur (instrumental)|Bron-Yr-Aur]]\".<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book |title=The Life and Times of Led Zeppelin |last=Morris |first=Robin |publisher=Assegai Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=9781620957936 |location=Jeffreys Bay, South Africa |pages=50}}</ref> The songs \"Misty Mountain Hop\", \"[[That's the Way (Led Zeppelin song)|That's the Way]]\", and early dabblings in what would become \"[[Stairway to Heaven]]\" were written in Wales and lyrically reflect Plant's mystical view of the land. Critic Steve Turner suggests that Plant's early and continued experiences in Wales served as the foundation for his broader interest in the mythologies he revisits in his lyrics (including those myth systems of Tolkien and the Norse).<ref>\"Stairway to Heaven, Paved with Gold: Led Zeppelin's Snowdonia\", ''The Independent'', 6 April 1991.</ref>\n\nPage's passion for diverse musical experiences influenced Plant to explore Africa, specifically [[Marrakesh]] in Morocco, where he encountered [[Umm Kulthum]]:\n\n{{blockquote|I was intrigued by the scales, initially, and obviously the vocal work.

On stage, Plant was particularly active in live performances, often dancing, jumping, skipping, snapping his fingers, clapping, making emphatic gestures to emphasise a lyric or cymbal crash, throwing back his head, or placing his hands on his hips. As the 1970s progressed he, along with the other members of Led Zeppelin, became increasingly flamboyant on-stage, and wore more elaborate, colourful clothing and jewellery.\n\nAccording to ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' magazine, \"once he had a couple of US tours under his belt, \"Percy\" Plant swiftly developed a staggering degree of bravado and swagger that irrefutably enhanced Led Zeppelin's rapidly burgeoning appeal.\"<ref>Fortnam, Ian (2008). \"Dazed & Confused\", ''[[Classic Rock Magazine]]: Classic Rock Presents Led Zeppelin'', p. 43.{{full citation needed|date=July 2022}}</ref> In 1994, during his \"Unledded\" tour with Jimmy Page, Plant himself reflected tongue-in-cheek upon his Led Zeppelin showmanship:\n\n{{blockquote|I can't take my whole persona as a singer back then very seriously.

Popular tracks from this period include \"[[Big Log]]\" (a Top 20 hit in 1983), \"[[In the Mood (Robert Plant song)|In the Mood]]\" (1983), \"[[Little by Little (Robert Plant song)|Little by Little]]\" (from 1985's ''[[Shaken 'n' Stirred]]''), \"Far Post\" (the B-side of \"[[Burning Down One Side]]\"), which appeared on the soundtrack of the 1985 movie ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]'' starring [[Gregory Hines]] and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], and popularised by airplay on [[album-oriented rock]] stations), \"[[Tall Cool One (Robert Plant song)|Tall Cool One]]\" (a No. 25 hit from 1988's ''[[Now and Zen]]'') and later \"[[I Believe (Robert Plant song)|I Believe]]\" (from 1993's ''[[Fate of Nations]]''). This last track, like Led Zeppelin's \"[[All My Love (Led Zeppelin song)|All My Love]]\", was written for and dedicated to his late son, Karac. Whilst Plant avoided performing Led Zeppelin songs through much of this period (although he would occasionally improvise his unique Zeppelin screams into his set), his tours in 1983 (with Phil Collins on drums) and in 1985 were very successful, often performing to sold-out arena-sized venues. In 1986 Plant performed at the [[Heart Beat 86|Birmingham Heart Beat Charity Concert]] with other famous Midlands musicians. \n[[File:Robert Plant and Phil Johnstone, backstage at Glastonbury Festival, 1993.jpg|alt=The two men looking rocked-out and happy posing for a photo|thumb|Plant, [[Phil Johnstone]], and ''[[Creem]]'' editor [[Dusty Wright]], backstage at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], 1993]]\n\nDuring the late 1980s and early 1990s Plant co-wrote three solo albums with keyboardist/songwriter [[Phil Johnstone]].

They released an EP called ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]'', and the band had a No. 3 hit with a remake of the [[Phil Phillips]]' tune \"[[Sea of Love (Phil Phillips song)|Sea of Love]]\", plus a follow-up hit with a cover of [[Roy Brown (blues musician)|Roy Brown]]'s \"[[Rockin' at Midnight]]\". The pair again worked together in the studio on the 1988 Page solo effort ''[[Outrider (album)|Outrider]]'', and in the same year Page contributed to Plant's album ''Now and Zen''. Also, on 15 May 1988 Plant appeared with Page as a member of Led Zeppelin, at the [[Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary]] concert (where he also performed in his own right as a solo artist). Plant's live collaborations with other well-known musicians continued when he took to the stage with Queen at Wembley Stadium, for 1992's \"The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert\" for AIDS Awareness; where he sang Queen's \"[[Innuendo (song)|Innuendo]]\" and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\", and Led Zeppelin's \"[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]\" and \"[[Thank You (Led Zeppelin song)|Thank You]]\".\n\n===Page and Plant (1994\u20131998)===\n[[Page and Plant]] became a full-fledged performing act from 1994 through 1998, releasing the ''[[No Quarter: Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded]]'' album in 1994 and following with an enormously successful tour in 1995, including a return to the Glastonbury Festival.<ref name=\"Lewis 2010 p. 553\">{{cite book | last=Lewis | first=D. | title=Led Zeppelin: The 'Tight But Loose' Files | publisher=Music Sales | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-85712-220-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jOzTNQk0C48C&pg=PT553 | access-date=19 August 2023 | page=553}}</ref> Fourteen years of speculation from their fans and occasional sniping between the two former members ended when they reconvened their former musical partnership to produce ''No Quarter''.

The album combines the results of both of these projects. The Led Zeppelin material features new arrangements and new instrumentation, including strings, Egyptian musicians and the vocals of British-Asian star Najma Akhtar.\n\nPage and Plant recorded their only post-Zeppelin album of original material as the 1998 album ''[[Walking into Clarksdale]]'', an effort that was unsuccessful commercially, leading Plant to return to his solo career after another world tour.

Steinman also wrote Tyler's other major 1980s hit \"[[Holding Out for a Hero]]\". She had success in mainland Europe during the 1990s with [[Dieter Bohlen]], who wrote and produced her hit \"[[Bitterblue (song)|Bitterblue]]\". In 2003, Tyler re-recorded \"Total Eclipse of the Heart\" with singer [[Kareen Antonn]]. Their bilingual duet, titled \"[[Si demain... (Turn Around)]]\", topped the French charts.\n\n''[[Rocks and Honey]]'' was released in 2013 and features the single \"[[Believe in Me (Bonnie Tyler song)|Believe in Me]]\", which she performed [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013|representing the United Kingdom]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]] in [[Malm\u00f6]], Sweden.

He was famous for having written the only song glorifying a brand of condoms, \"Ram-a-Lamb-a-Man,\" from his album ''[[Win This Record!]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-01-02-ca-51-story.html|title=POP MUSIC REVIEW : Lindley Keeps on His Toes During New Year's Kickoff|date=1990-01-02|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-lindley-mn0000211146/biography|title=David Lindley {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]] |date=2020-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200318132109/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/david-lindley-mn0000211146/biography|access-date=2020-03-18|archive-date=March 18, 2020}}</ref> The media often commented on his colorful polyester clothing,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/03/16/95937873/david-lindley-on-mountain-stage |title=David Lindley On Mountain Stage |date=October 21, 2008 |website=[[NPR]] |author=Staff |access-date=March 6, 2023}} Reprinted on March 15, 2011.</ref> with jarring contrasts between pants and shirt, earning him the nickname Prince of Polyester.<ref name=NorthCoastJournal/>\n\n==Work with other artists==\n[[File:David Lindley.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Lindley in Brisbane, 1980]]\n\nLindley was known for his work as a session musician.

He was known in the guitar community for his use of \"cheap\" instruments sold at [[Sears, Roebuck and Co.|Sears department stores]] and intended for amateurs. He used these for the unique sounds they produce, especially with a slide. In the early 1990s, he toured and recorded with [[Hani Naser]] adding [[percussion|percussive instrument]]s to his solo performances, and his instrumental repertoire which he used in his session work. Lindley also toured extensively and recorded with [[reggae]] percussionist [[Wally Ingram]]. \n\nLindley's voice may be heard in the version of \"[[Stay (Maurice Williams song)|Stay]]\" performed by [[Jackson Browne]]. Browne's version is a continuation of \"The Load Out\", and its refrain is sung in progressively higher vocal ranges. The refrain of  \"Oh won't you stay, just a little bit longer\" is sung first by Browne, then by [[Rosemary Butler (singer)|Rosemary Butler]], then by Lindley in falsetto.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtuvXrTz8DY| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112172100/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtuvXrTz8DY| archive-date=2009-01-12 | url-status=dead|title=Jackson Browne The Load Out / Stay 1978 |last=Browne|first=Jackson|year=1978 |work= Jackson Browne in Concert Live at Shepherd's Bush Theatre, London 1978 distributed on YouTube, time mark 7:03|access-date=2009-09-19}}</ref>\n\nLindley joined Jackson Browne for a tour of Spain in 2006.

''Cashbox'' and ''Billboard'' magazines gave all four sides positive reviews, and Diamond signed with [[Columbia Records]] as a solo performer later in 1962. In July 1963, Columbia released the single \"Clown Town\" / \"At Night\"; ''Billboard'' gave a laudatory review to \"Clown Town\", and ''Cashbox'' was complimentary to both sides, but it still failed to make the charts. Columbia dropped him from their label and he went back to writing songs in and out of publishing houses for the next seven years.\n\nDiamond wrote wherever he could, including on buses, and used an upright piano above the [[Birdland (New York jazz club)|Birdland Club]] in New York City. One of the causes of this early nomadic life as a songwriter was his songs' wordiness: \"I'd spent a lot of time on lyrics, and they were looking for hooks, and I didn't really understand the nature of that\", he says.<ref name=RS76/> He was able to sell only about one song a week during those years, barely enough to survive.

I wasn't under the gun, and suddenly interesting songs began to happen, songs that had things none of the others did.\"<ref name=RS76/> Among them were \"[[Cherry, Cherry]]\" and \"[[Solitary Man (song)|Solitary Man]]\". \"Solitary Man\" was the first record that Diamond recorded under his own name which made the charts. It remains one of his personal favorites, as it was about his early years as a songwriter, even though he failed to realize it at the time. He describes the song as \"an outgrowth of my despair\".<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|37}}\n\nDiamond spent his early career in the [[Brill Building]]. His first success as a songwriter came in November 1965 with \"[[Sunday and Me]]\", a Top 20 hit for [[Jay and the Americans]]. Greater success followed with \"[[I'm a Believer]]\", \"[[A Little Bit Me, a Little Bit You]]\", \"Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow)\", and \"Love to Love\", all performed by [[the Monkees]]. He wrote and recorded the songs for himself, but the other versions were released before his own.<ref>{{cite news |title = Interview |work = [[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]] |date = May 23, 2008 |publisher = BBC One }}</ref> The unintended consequence was that Diamond began to gain fame as a songwriter. \"I'm a Believer\" became a gold record within two days of its release and stayed at the top of the charts for seven weeks, making it the Popular Music Song of the Year in 1966.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|44}}\n\n\"[[And the Grass Won't Pay No Mind]]\" brought covers from [[Elvis Presley]] (who also interpreted \"Sweet Caroline\") and [[Mark Lindsay]], former lead singer for [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]].

Berns wanted to release \"Kentucky Woman\" as a single, but Diamond was no longer satisfied writing simple pop songs, so he proposed \"[[Shilo (song)|Shilo]]\", which was not about the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] but rather an imaginary childhood friend. Bang believed that the song was not commercial enough, so it was relegated to being an LP track on ''[[Just for You (Neil Diamond album)|Just for You]]''. Diamond was also dissatisfied with his royalties and tried to sign with another record label after discovering a loophole in his contract that did not bind him exclusively to either WEB IV or Tallyrand, but the result was a series of lawsuits that coincided with a slump in his record sales and professional success. A magistrate refused WEB IV's request for a temporary injunction to prevent Diamond from joining another record company while his contract dispute continued in court, but the lawsuits persisted until February 1977, when he triumphed in court and purchased the rights to his Bang-era master tapes.<ref name=Jackson/>{{rp|51}}\n\nIn March 1968, Diamond signed a deal with [[Uni Records]]; the label was named after [[Universal Pictures]], the owner of which, [[MCA Inc.]], later consolidated its labels into [[MCA Records]] (now called [[Universal Music]] after merging with PolyGram in 1999). His debut album for Uni/MCA was in late 1968 with ''[[Velvet Gloves and Spit]]'', produced by [[Tom Catalano]], which did not chart, and he recorded the early 1969 follow-up ''[[Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show]]'' at [[American Sound Studios]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] with [[Tommy Cogbill]] and [[Chips Moman]] producing.\n\n===1970s===\nIn mid 1969, Diamond moved to Los Angeles.

The recording included Knopfler (guitar and vocals), Steve Phillips (second guitar), Dave Johnson (bass), and Paul Granger (percussion). Johnson, Granger, and vocalist Mick Dewhirst played with Knopfler in a band called Silverheels; Phillips was later to rejoin Knopfler in the short lived side exercise from Dire Straits, [[The Notting Hillbillies]].\n\nUpon graduation in 1973, Knopfler moved to London and joined a band based in [[High Wycombe]] called [[Brewers Droop]].  This group had issued studio-recorded material before Knopfler joined, and went into the studio while Knopfler was a member -- but Brewer's Droop material with Knopfler remained unissued until appearing on their 1989 archival album ''[[The Booze Brothers]]''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Steve Huey |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-booze-brothers-mw0000205981 |title=The Booze Brothers \u2013 Brewers Droop |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=18 September 2018 |archive-date=14 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914022902/https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-booze-brothers-mw0000205981 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\nOne night, while spending time with friends, the only guitar available was an old acoustic with a badly warped neck that had been strung with extra-light strings to make it usable. Even so, he found it impossible to play unless he finger-picked it, leading to the development of his signature playing style. He said in a later interview, \"That was where I found my 'voice' on guitar.\" After a brief stint with Brewers Droop, Knopfler took a job as a lecturer at [[Epping Forest College|Loughton College]] in Essex \u2013 a position he held for three years. Throughout this time, he continued performing with local [[pub]] bands, including the Caf\u00e9 Racers.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}\n\nBy the mid-1970s, Knopfler devoted much of his musical energies to his group, the Caf\u00e9 Racers. His brother David moved to London, where he shared a flat with [[John Illsley]], a guitarist who changed over to playing bass guitar. In April 1977, Mark moved out of his flat in [[Buckhurst Hill]] and moved in with David and John.

On 27 July 1977, they recorded the demo tapes of five songs: \"Wild West End\", \"[[Sultans of Swing]]\", \"Down to the Waterline\", \"Sacred Loving\" (a David Knopfler song), and \"Water of Love\". They later recorded \"Southbound Again\", \"In the Gallery\", and \"Six Blade Knife\" for [[BBC Radio London]]\u2014and, finally, on 9 November, made demo tapes of \"[[Setting Me Up]]\", \"Eastbound Train\", and \"Real Girl\". Many of these songs reflect Knopfler's experiences in Newcastle, Leeds, and London, and were featured on their first album, the eponymous ''[[Dire Straits (album)|Dire Straits]],'' which was released in the following year: \"Down to the Waterline\" recalled images of life in Newcastle; \"In The Gallery\" is a tribute to a Leeds sculptor and artist named Harry Phillips (father of [[Steve Phillips (musician)|Steve Phillips]]); and \"Lions\", \"Wild West End\", and \"Eastbound Train\" were all drawn from Knopfler's early days in the capital.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nOn its initial release in October 1978, the album ''Dire Straits'' received little fanfare in the UK, but when \"Sultans of Swing\" was released as a single, it became a chart hit in the Netherlands and album sales took off \u2013 first across Europe, and then in the United States and Canada, and finally the UK. The group's second album, ''[[Communiqu\u00e9 (Dire Straits album)|Communiqu\u00e9]],'' produced by [[Jerry Wexler]] and [[Barry Beckett]], followed in June 1979.\n\nTheir third album, ''[[Making Movies]]'', released in October 1980, moved towards more complex arrangements and production, which continued for the remainder of the group's career. The album included many of Mark Knopfler's most personal compositions, most notably \"[[Romeo and Juliet (Dire Straits song)|Romeo and Juliet]]\" and \"[[Tunnel of Love (Dire Straits song)|Tunnel of Love]]\", with its intro \"The Carousel Waltz\" by [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]], which also featured in the 1982 [[Richard Gere]] film ''[[An Officer and a Gentleman]]''. There were frequent personnel changes within Dire Straits from 1980 onwards, with Mark Knopfler and John Illsley the only members to remain throughout the group's 18-year existence. In 1980 whilst the recording sessions for ''Making Movies'' were taking place, tensions between the Knopfler brothers reached a point where David Knopfler decided to leave the band for a solo career.<ref>{{cite web |last= Genzel |first= Christian |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p18708 |title=David Knopfler |publisher= AllMusic |access-date= 17 April 2011}}</ref> The remaining trio continued the album, with [[Roy Bittan]] from [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s [[E Street Band]] guesting on keyboards and session guitarist [[Sid McGinnis]] on rhythm guitar, although he was uncredited on the album.

Shortly after the album's release, Pick Withers left the band.\n\nIn early 1983, with ''Love Over Gold'' still in the albums charts, the band released a four-song [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''[[ExtendedancEPlay]]''. Featuring the hit single \"[[Twisting by the Pool]]\", this was the first output by the band that featured new drummer [[Terry Williams (drummer)|Terry Williams]], (formerly of [[Rockpile]] and [[Man (band)|Man]]). An eight month long [[Love over Gold Tour]] followed which finished with two sold-out concerts at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] on 22 and 23 July 1983. In March 1984 the double album ''[[Alchemy: Dire Straits Live|Alchemy Live]]'' was released, which documented the recordings of these final two live shows. It was also released in [[VHS]] video and reached number three in the [[UK Albums Chart]], and was reissued in DVD and Blu-ray format in 2010.\n\nDuring 1983 and 1984, Mark Knopfler was also involved with other projects outside of Dire Straits, some of which other band members contributed towards. Knopfler and Terry Williams played on [[Phil Everly]]'s and [[Cliff Richard]]'s song \"[[She Means Nothing To Me]]\", which reached the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart in February 1983, taken from the album \"Phil Everly\".

Knopfler wrote the music score for the film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', released at the end of 1987. It featured the song \"Storybook Love\" with [[Willy DeVille]]. \n\nMark Knopfler also took part in a comedy skit (featured on the ''[[French and Saunders]]'' show) titled \"The Easy Guitar Book Sketch\" with comedian [[Rowland Rivron]] and fellow British musicians [[David Gilmour]], [[Lemmy]] from Mot\u00f6rhead, [[Mark King (musician)|Mark King]] from Level 42, and [[Gary Moore]].

It leaned heavily towards American roots music \u2013 [[Folk music|folk]], [[Blues]] and [[country music]]. The band members included keyboardist [[Guy Fletcher]], with [[Brendan Croker]] and [[Steve Phillips (musician)|Steve Phillips]]. For both the album and the tour [[Paul Franklin (musician)|Paul Franklin]] was added to the line-up on pedal steel. The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album, ''[[Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time]]'' was released in March 1990, and Knopfler then toured with the Notting Hillbillies for the remainder of that year. He further emphasised his country music influences with his 1990s collaboration with [[Chet Atkins]], ''[[Neck and Neck]]'', which won three Grammy awards. The Hillbillies toured the UK in early 1990 with a limited number of shows. In this low-key tour the band packed out smaller venues such as Newcastle University.\n\n[[File:Dire Straits 1985 Mark Knopfler Alan Clark Jack Sonni.jpg|thumb|Knopfler with Dire Straits performing in [[Belgrade]], 10 May 1985]]\nIn 1990, Knopfler, John Illsley, and Alan Clark [[Concerts at Knebworth House#Major concerts|performed as Dire Straits at Knebworth]], joined by Eric Clapton, [[Ray Cooper]], and guitarist [[Phil Palmer]] (who was at that time part of Eric Clapton's touring band), and in January the following year, Knopfler, John Illsley and manager [[Ed Bicknell]] decided to reform Dire Straits. Knopfler, Illsley, Alan Clark, and Guy Fletcher set about recording what turned out to be their final studio album accompanied by [[sideman|sidemen]] Phil Palmer, pedal steel guitarist [[Paul Franklin (musician)|Paul Franklin]], percussionist Danny Cummings and [[Toto (band)|Toto]] drummer [[Jeff Porcaro]].\n\nThe follow-up to ''Brothers in Arms'' was finally released in September 1991. ''[[On Every Street]]'' was nowhere near as popular as its predecessor, and met with a mixed critical reaction, with some reviewers regarding the album as an underwhelming comeback after a six-year break. Nonetheless, the album sold well and reached No. 1 in the UK. Session drummer [[Chris Whitten]] joined Dire Straits as they embarked on a gruelling [[On Every Street Tour|world tour]] featuring 300 shows in front of some 7.1 million ticket-buying fans. This was to be Dire Straits' final world tour; it was not as well received as the previous ''Brothers in Arms'' tour, and by this time Mark Knopfler had had enough of such huge operations. Manager [[Ed Bicknell]] is quoted as saying \"The last tour was utter misery. Whatever the [[zeitgeist]] was that we had been part of, it had passed.\" John Illsley agreed, saying \"Personal relationships were in trouble and it put a terrible strain on everybody, emotionally and physically. We were changed by it.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Paul|last=Rees|title=The sultan of swing|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #210|date=June 2015|page=124}}</ref> This drove the band into the ground, and ultimately led to the group's final dissolution in 1995.\n\nFollowing the tour, Knopfler took some time off from the music business. In 1993, he received an honorary music doctorate from the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. Two more Dire Straits albums were released, both live albums. ''[[On the Night]]'', released in May 1993, documented Dire Straits' final world tour. In 1995, following the release of ''[[Live at the BBC (Dire Straits album)|Live at the BBC]]'' (a contractual release to [[Vertigo Records]]), Mark Knopfler quietly dissolved Dire Straits and launched his career as a solo artist. Knopfler later recalled that, \"I put the thing to bed because I wanted to get back to some kind of reality. It's self-protection, a survival thing. That kind of scale is dehumanizing.\"<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite web|last=McCormick |first=Neil |title=Mark Knopfler: how did we avoid disaster? |work=The Telegraph |date=5 September 2012 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9522983/Mark-Knopfler-how-did-we-avoid-disaster.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9522983/Mark-Knopfler-how-did-we-avoid-disaster.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |access-date=25 November 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Knopfler would spend two years recovering from the experience, which had taken a toll on his creative and personal life.\n\nSince the break-up of Dire Straits, Knopfler has shown no interest in reforming the group. However, keyboardist Guy Fletcher has been associated with almost every piece of Knopfler's solo material to date, while Danny Cummings has also contributed frequently, notably to four of Knopfler's recent solo album releases: ''[[All the Roadrunning]]'' (with Emmylou Harris), ''[[Kill to Get Crimson]]'', ''[[Get Lucky (Mark Knopfler album)|Get Lucky]]'' and ''[[One Deep River]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=Kill to Get Crimson |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/kill-to-get-crimson-r1111886 |work=AllMusic |access-date=15 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Ruhlmann |first=William |title=Get Lucky |work=AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/get-lucky-mw0000827991 |access-date=15 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2008 Knopfler declined a suggestion by John Illsley that the band should reform.

He reflected that the band members had \"reached the end of the road\" after the end of their final world tour in 1992, and that he was \"pretty happy\" when the band's run came to an end, recalling feeling \"mentally, physically and emotionally exhausted\" by the time Dire Straits disbanded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/dire-straits-turn-down-huge-amounts-of-money-to-reform-3531223|title=Dire Straits turn down \"huge amounts of money\" to reform|first=Max|last=Pilley|website=NME|date=5 November 2023|access-date=19 November 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/dire-straits-reunion-mark-knopfler-ilsley-b2441539.html|title=Dire Straits are in demand as 'huge amounts offered' for reunion|date=4 November 2023|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=19 November 2023}}</ref> At the time, Illsley also said \"I can openly admit to you that I really enjoyed the success of the band, I'm speaking for Mark as well, we both really enjoyed [it].

It featured the UK single \"[[Darling Pretty]]\". The album's recording sessions helped create Knopfler's backing band, which is also known as ''The 96ers''. It features Knopfler's old bandmate Guy Fletcher on keyboards. This band's main line-up has lasted much longer than any Dire Straits line-up. Also in 1996, Knopfler recorded guitar for Ted Christopher's [[Dunblane massacre]] tribute cover, ''[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]''.\n\nKnopfler composed his first film score in 1983 for [[Local Hero (film)|Local Hero]].

This has been his most successful to date, possibly helped by the number of notable contributors to the album, like [[Van Morrison]].

The album was released in two editions, as a single CD (with a grey cover) and as a double CD (with the cover in blue), and was well received. The only previously unreleased track on the album is ''All the Roadrunning'', a duet with country music singer [[Emmylou Harris]], which was followed in 2006 by an album of duets of the same name.\n\nReleased in April 2006, ''[[All the Roadrunning]]'' reached No. 1 in Denmark and Switzerland, No. 2 in Norway and Sweden, No. 3 in Germany, The Netherlands and Italy, No. 8 in Austria and UK, No. 9 in Spain, No. 17 in the United States (''Billboard'' Top 200 Chart), No. 25 in Ireland, and No. 41 in Australia.

The Notting Hillbillies sole studio album, ''[[Missing...Presumed Having a Good Time]]'' was released in 1990 and featured the minor hit single \"Your Own Sweet Way\". Knopfler further emphasised his country music influences with his collaboration with [[Chet Atkins]], ''[[Neck and Neck]]'', which was also released in 1990. \"[[Poor Boy Blues]]\", taken from that collaboration, peaked at No. 92.\n\nKnopfler's other contributions include writing and playing guitar on [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s 1992 single \"[[When It Comes to You]]\" (from his album ''[[Seminole Wind]]''). In 1993 [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]] also released a cover of the Dire Straits song ''[[The Bug (song)|The Bug]]''. [[Randy Travis]] released another of Knopfler's songs, \"Are We in Trouble Now\", in 1996. In that same year, Knopfler's solo single \"[[Darling Pretty]]\" reached a peak of No. 87.\n\nKnopfler collaborated with [[George Jones]] on the 1994 ''[[The Bradley Barn Sessions]]'' album, performing guitar duties on the classic [[J.P.

Loggins attended [[San Gabriel Mission High School]], graduating in 1966. He formed a band, The Second Helping, that released three singles during 1968 and 1969 on [[Viva Records (U.S.)|Viva Records]]. [[Greg Shaw]] described the efforts as \"excellent [[punk rock|punky]] [[folk music|folk-pop]] records\" that were written by Loggins who was likely to be the bandleader and singer as well; Shaw included \"Let Me In\" on both ''[[Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 2]]'' and the ''[[Pebbles, Volume 9 (CD)|Pebbles, Volume 9]]'' CD.<ref>Liner notes, Highs in the Mid-Sixties, Volume 2. Ref. August 21, 2008.</ref>\n\nLoggins had a short gig playing guitar for [[The Electric Prunes#The \"New Improved\" Electric Prunes|the New Improved Electric Prunes]] in 1969 before writing four songs for the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] that were included on their album ''[[Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy]]''.<ref name=POEM>[http://www.poemhunter.com/lyrics/kenny-loggins/biography/ \"Biography: Kenny Loggins\"] Poem Hunter.com</ref> During his early 20s, he was in the band Gator Creek with [[Mike Deasy]]. The first recorded version of \"[[Danny's Song]]\" (later recorded by Loggins and Messina and a No. 7 Hot 100 hit for [[Anne Murray]] in 1973) was included on their only album, released on [[Mercury Records]].\n\n== Loggins and Messina ==\n[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], formerly of [[Poco (band)|Poco]] and [[Buffalo Springfield]], was working as an independent record producer for [[Columbia Records]] in 1970 when he was introduced to Loggins, then a little-known singer-songwriter who was signed to [[ABC Records|ABC-Dunhill]].\n\nThe two recorded a number of Loggins's compositions in Messina's home living room. When Columbia signed Loggins (with Messina's help) to a six-album contract, recording began in earnest for Loggins's debut album, with Messina as producer. He assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning his old friends bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante (both formerly of [[the Sunshine Company]], a disbanded 1960s group from Los Angeles), violinist/multireedist Al Garth and multireedist Jon Clarke. Keyboardist [[Michael Omartian]] also played on the album and despite dropping out at the start of the touring, continued to play keyboards on the next two albums. Los Angeles\u2013based session percussionist [[Milt Holland]], described by Messina as an [[ethnomusicology|ethnomusicologist]], also contributed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flans |first=Robyn |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-loggins-messinas-vahevala/375146 |title=Classic Tracks: Loggins & Messina's \"Vahevala\" |publisher=Mixonline |date=January 9, 2004 |access-date=November 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nMessina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messina's well-established Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences. But by the time the album was completed, Messina had contributed so much to the album in terms of songwriting, arrangement, instrumentation and vocals that an \"accidental\" duo was born. Thus the full name of their first album was ''[[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina Sittin' In]]''. The album's first single release, the Caribbean-flavored \"Vahevala\", found top 3 success on [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] on May 18, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/ilc/wcfl051872.htm|title=WCFL \u2013 all hit music in the Midwest|date=May 18, 1972|access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kenny Loggins.jpg|thumb|A publicity photo, {{circa|1980}}]]\nAlthough the album went unnoticed by radio upon release, it eventually found success by fall 1972, particularly on college campuses where the pair toured heavily. Loggins and Messina's vocal harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a one-off album became an entity in itself. Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a well-known producer. Instead of continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer, they decided to record as a duo, Loggins & Messina.\n\n''\"When our first album, 'Sittin' In', came out, we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales\"'', Messina recalled in 2005.\n{{Blockquote|text=We had a choice. It was either I now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work. For me, I did not desire to go back out on the road. I had had enough of that and I wanted to produce records. But [[Clive Davis]] (then president of the record company) intervened and said, \"You know, I think you'd be making a mistake if you guys didn't take this opportunity. Things like this only happen once in a lifetime. It may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest.\" He was absolutely correct. Kenny made the decision as well. It delayed his solo career, but it gave him an opportunity, I think, to have one.<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\">\"Together again: Kenny Loggins and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] bring their hits to Biloxi\", by Ron Thibodeaux, The Times-Picayune (New Orleans), July 29, 2005.</ref> }}\n\nBoth members of the duo were guitarists: Loggins played rhythm guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar and harmonica and Messina played lead guitar with both acoustic and electric guitar, mandolin and Dobro. Over the next four years they produced five more albums of original material in the studio, plus one album of [[Cover version|covers]] of other artists' material and two live albums. They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s, surpassed later in the decade only by [[Daryl Hall & John Oates]].<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" /> Their work also included [[Lynn Anderson]]'s \"[[Listen to a Country Song (song)|Listen to a Country Song]]\", which was released in 1972 and reached No.&nbsp;4 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles]] chart, and \"[[Danny's Song]]\" and \"[[A Love Song (Loggins and Messina song)|A Love Song]]\" for [[Anne Murray]], which reached No.&nbsp;7 and No.&nbsp;12 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]] pop chart in 1973 and 1974 respectively.  The latter two songs also hit No.&nbsp;1 on the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart. Later studio albums often found Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record than as a genuine partnership. As they both noted in 2005, their collaboration eventually became more a competition. Following their January 1976 release of ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]'' and a final concert in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, on September 25, 1976, the pair amicably and quietly parted to pursue solo careers. A greatest-hits album, ''[[The Best of Friends (album)|The Best of Friends]]'', was released in November 1976. Two months later, a live album, ''[[Finale (album)|Finale]]'' was released, more by record company decision than one intended by the artists, one year after the duo had come to an end.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}\n\n== Solo career ==\n[[File:Kenny Loggins 1977.jpg|thumb|Loggins performing in 1977]]\nIn 1977, Loggins produced his first solo album, ''[[Celebrate Me Home]]'', which included the successful song \"[[I Believe in Love (Kenny Loggins song)|I Believe in Love]]\", originally sung by [[Barbra Streisand]] in ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. ''[[Nightwatch (album)|Nightwatch]]'', a popular album released in 1978, included the hit song \"Whenever I Call You Friend\", a duet with [[Stevie Nicks]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]], co-written with [[Melissa Manchester]]. Loggins followed that in 1979 with ''[[Keep the Fire]]'' and in 1982 with ''[[High Adventure]]''. The latter contained his rock duet with [[Journey (band)|Journey]] frontman [[Steve Perry (musician)|Steve Perry]], \"[[Don't Fight It (Kenny Loggins & Steve Perry song)|Don't Fight It]]\", which rose to No.&nbsp;17 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100]] chart. Loggins abandoned the harmonica in his solo career but continued to play guitar, just as he had done with Loggins & Messina.\n\n=== With Michael McDonald ===\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2023}}\nLoggins also co-wrote the song \"[[What a Fool Believes]]\" with [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]]. Each recorded his own version of it, with McDonald recording as a member of [[the Doobie Brothers]]. Loggins' version was released first, but the Doobie Brothers' version achieved greater success, reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the Hot 100 and earning Loggins and McDonald the 1980 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].\n\nIn 1979, Loggins and McDonald wrote \"[[This Is It (Kenny Loggins song)|This Is It]]\". The song was a love song and ultimatum to a woman having an affair and stringing her lover along, while refusing to make a final decision.  The song earned Loggins the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]]. [[NBC]] used the song as theme music for its coverage of the [[NCAA men's basketball tournament]] in 1980 and 1981.\n\n=== Soundtracks ===\nDuring the next decade, Loggins recorded so many successful songs for film soundtracks that he became known as the King of the Movie Soundtrack.<ref>[http://www.answers.com/topic/kenny-loggins \"Kenny Loggins\"] Gale Music Profiles</ref><ref>Franko, Vanessa: [http://www.pe.com/localnews/temecula/stories/PE_News_Local_D_loggins04.326bf83.html \"Temecula film fest to honor Kenny Loggins\"] ''Temecula Press-Enterprise'', August 3, 2010</ref> It began with \"[[I'm Alright (Kenny Loggins song)|I'm Alright]]\" from ''[[Caddyshack]]''. Hits followed with \"[[Footloose (song)|Footloose]]\" (his only solo No.&nbsp;1) and \"[[I'm Free (Heaven Helps the Man)]]\" from ''[[Footloose (1984 soundtrack)|Footloose]]''; \"[[Meet Me Half Way]]\" from ''[[Over the Top (1987 film)|Over the Top]]''; and \"[[Danger Zone (song)|Danger Zone]]\" and \"[[Playing with the Boys]]\" from ''[[Top Gun]]''. Loggins also performed [[Nobody's Fool (Kenny Loggins song)|\"Nobody's Fool\"]] for the film ''[[Caddyshack II]]''. He performed as a member of [[USA for Africa]] on the famine-relief fundraising single \"[[We Are the World]]\", which led to an appearance performing \"Footloose\" at the Philadelphia leg of the July 13, 1985, [[Live Aid]] famine-relief dual-venue charity concert and global television broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://liveaid.free.fr/ |title=The definitive LIVE AID site : all you wanted to know about the greatest concert on Earth |publisher=Liveaid.free.fr |access-date=June 25, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s, Loggins continued his album career, including the popular 1994 children's album ''[[Return to Pooh Corner]]'', which included the title single, a reworking of \"[[House at Pooh Corner (song)|House at Pooh Corner]]\", written for his newborn son Luke.\n\nIn 1991, Loggins recorded and produced ''[[Leap of Faith (Kenny Loggins album)|Leap of Faith]]'', which included the single \"[[Conviction of the Heart]]\". Vice President [[Al Gore]] called this song \"the unofficial anthem of the [[environmental movement]]\". On [[Earth Day]] 1995, Loggins performed at [[The National Mall]] in Washington, D.C., before a live audience of 500,000.\n\nIn 1997, Loggins released the album ''[[The Unimaginable Life]]'', based on a book he co-wrote with his then-wife Julia. Tracks include \"Now That I Know Love\", \"The Art of Letting Go\" and \"One Chance at a Time\". The album was produced by Loggins and [[Randy Jackson]] with background vocals by [[Skyler Jett]], Lamont VanHook and Howard Smith.\n\nIn 1998, Loggins recorded a version of the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' song \"One Small Voice\" for the ABC television special ''[[Elmopalooza]]'', which was included as a track on the Grammy Award-winning [[Elmopalooza! (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]].\n\n=== Other work ===\n[[File:Kenny Loggins-and Boston Pops 2.jpg|thumb|right|Loggins with [[Boston Pops Orchestra]] and conductor [[Keith Lockhart]], June 22, 2011]]\nLoggins scored a No. 1 single on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|adult contemporary chart]] in 1997 with \"For the First Time\" (his [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-nominated song from ''One Fine Day''). In 2000, he performed the theme song for Disney's ''[[The Tigger Movie]]'', \"[[Your Heart Will Lead You Home]]\", which he co-wrote with [[Richard and Robert Sherman]].\n\nIn 1999, he appeared as himself on the television show ''[[Dharma & Greg]]'' in the episode \"[[List of Dharma & Greg episodes#Season 3: 1999\u20132000|Tye-Dying the Knot]]\", performing at Abby and Larry's wedding.\nIn 2004, Loggins appeared as himself in episode three, \"Well Well Well,\" of Fox TV's ''[[Method & Red]]''. In 2005, Loggins and Messina gave a nationwide tour that resulted in the CD and DVD ''Loggins and Messina Sittin' In Again''. The tour's concerts were three hours long with an intermission and included an acoustic set in the middle.

After their split, Mayer continued to play at local clubs, refining his skills and gaining a minor following. He performed at the 2000 [[South by Southwest]] festival, and was subsequently signed by [[Aware Records]], an imprint of [[Columbia Records]] through which he released his debut [[extended play]] (EP), ''[[Inside Wants Out]]'' (1999). His first two studio albums\u2014''[[Room for Squares]]'' (2001) and ''[[Heavier Things]]'' (2003)\u2014were both met with critical and commercial success; the former won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for its single \"[[Your Body Is a Wonderland]]\", while the latter peaked atop the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\nBy 2005, Mayer had moved away from the acoustic music that characterized his early records, and further delved into the [[blues]] and rock music which had originally influenced him. Forming the [[John Mayer Trio]], he released the live album, ''[[Try!]]'' (2005) and his third studio album, ''[[Continuum (John Mayer album)|Continuum]]'' (2006). Both were met with positive critical reception, while the latter received a nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], and won both [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] for its single, \"[[Waiting on the World to Change]]\" at the [[49th Annual Grammy Awards]]. It was followed by ''[[Battle Studies (album)|Battle Studies]]'' (2009) which marked his return to [[pop music|pop]].\n\nAfter having several controversial incidents with the media, Mayer withdrew from public life in 2010 and drew inspiration from the 1970s pop music of [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles#History|Laurel Canyon]] for the sound of his fifth studio album, ''[[Born and Raised (John Mayer album)|Born and Raised]]'' (2012). Discovery of a [[granuloma]] on his vocal cords delayed the release of the album until May 2012, and forced him to cancel its accompanying tour. Despite favorable reception and becoming his second release to peak atop the ''Billboard'' 200, the album was less commercially successful than his previous work. Mayer recovered in January 2013 and released his sixth studio album, ''[[Paradise Valley (album)|Paradise Valley]]'' in August of that year, which peaked at number two on the chart and incorporated [[country music|country]], [[folk music|folk]], and [[Americana (music)|Americana]] influences. His seventh album, ''[[The Search for Everything]]'' (2017) was a loose [[concept album|concept]] based around themes of a romantic break-up. His eighth, ''[[Sob Rock]]'' (2021) was inspired by 1980s [[soft rock]] music.\n\nIn 2015, three former members of the [[Grateful Dead]] joined with Mayer and two other musicians to form the band [[Dead & Company]].<ref name=deadtour/> It was the latest of several [[Reunions of the Grateful Dead|reunions]] of the band's surviving members since [[Jerry Garcia]]'s death in 1995.<ref name= NYT-Launch16>{{Citation |date=February 8, 2016 |title=Dead & Company To Launch 2016 Tour |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |url=http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201602080700PR_NEWS_USPRX____LA17152&feedID=600&press_symbol=3744685 |access-date=April 8, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420134946/http://markets.on.nytimes.com/research/stocks/news/press_release.asp?docTag=201602080700PR_NEWS_USPRX____LA17152&feedID=600&press_symbol=3744685 |archive-date=April 20, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name= Nev11.27.A>{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=John |date=December 1, 2015 |title=Review + photos: Dead & Company a tale of two shows in one night at MGM Grand |website=[[Las Vegas Sun]] |url=http://lasvegassun.com/vegasdeluxe/2015/dec/01/review-photos-dead-company-a-tale-of-two-shows-one/ |access-date=April 8, 2016 |quote=\"With superb guitar skills and strong vocals on several titles (\"West L.A.

[[Jeff Chimenti]], who has toured with the various spin-offs of the Dead since the 1990s, is the group's keyboardist. \n \nAlthough Mayer had been familiar with the music of the Grateful Dead since at least high school, he began to develop a strong interest in their music in 2011 after hearing their song ''[[Althea (Grateful Dead song)|Althea]]'' by chance on [[Pandora radio]]. In 2015, while the Dead's ''[[Fare Thee Well: Celebrating 50 Years of the Grateful Dead|Fare Thee Well]]'' shows with [[Trey Anastasio]] were also being planned, Mayer performed \"Althea\" with Weir on [[The Late Late Show (U.S. TV series)|The Late Late Show]], along with \"[[Truckin']]\". Weir was impressed with Mayer's take on the material and began planning to work with him after the Fare Thee Well shows, despite them being billed as something of finale for the band and its legacy. Weir discussed the genesis of the band and his thoughts about working with Mayer in an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' in 2016:\n\n{{Blockquote|I was doing preliminary get-togethers with Trey, kicking around the material. Trey is also a monster musician. If I had to make a broad categorization, John is a classicist by nature. Trey is more of an iconoclast. They're both explorers, someone who's happy to break tradition. Juxtaposing Trey's take on the material with the insights John brings got me looking at all of the songs afresh.\n\nI look forward to playing with Trey again, any old time. But I am really eager to get back out with John-boy and chase the music around, get to know each other. When that dream came to me, it was at about that point that I started to realize that I was feeling comfortable with knowing that John had moved, musically speaking \u2013 being able to intuit the songs.

In 1975, the album ''[[One of These Nights]]'' became their first number-one album in the US and a top ten album in many countries. It included the US number-one hit \"[[One of These Nights (Eagles song)|One of These Nights]]\", which was their first top ten hit outside of North America, and US top-5 songs \"[[Lyin' Eyes]]\" and \"[[Take It to the Limit (Eagles song)|Take It to the Limit]]\".

The album yielded two number-one singles in the US and Canada, \"[[New Kid in Town]]\" and \"[[Hotel California]]\", the latter of which became their only top-10 hit in the United Kingdom, while also reaching the top ten in New Zealand and many European countries, including number two in France.\n\nMeisner was replaced by [[Timothy B.

The Eagles released their last studio album for nearly 28 years in 1979 with ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]'', spawning the North American number-one song \"[[Heartache Tonight]]\", which became their biggest hit in Australia (number 13), and the North American top-10 hits \"[[The Long Run (song)|The Long Run]]\" and \"[[I Can't Tell You Why]]\". The Eagles broke up in 1980 but reunited in 1994 for the album ''[[Hell Freezes Over]]'', a mix of live and new studio tracks, and toured consistently. In 2007, the Eagles released ''[[Long Road Out of Eden]]'', their sixth number-one album in the US, and in 2008 launched the [[Long Road Out of Eden Tour]].

The album took two years to complete. It was originally intended to be a double album, but the band members were unable to write enough songs. ''The Long Run'' was released on September 24, 1979. Considered a disappointment by some critics for failing to live up to ''Hotel California'', it proved a huge commercial hit nonetheless; the album topped the charts and sold seven million copies. In addition, it included three Top 10 singles. \"[[Heartache Tonight]]\" became their last single to top the Hot 100, on November 10, 1979. The [[The Long Run (song)|title track]] and \"[[I Can't Tell You Why]]\" both reached number 8. The band won their fourth Grammy for \"Heartache Tonight\". \"[[In the City (Joe Walsh song)|In the City]]\" by Walsh and \"The Sad Cafe\" became live staples.

Elektra, the band's long-time record label, initially owned the rights to solo albums created by members of the Eagles. Walsh had established himself as a solo artist in the 1970s, but it was uncharted waters for the others.\n\nWalsh released a successful album in 1981, ''[[There Goes the Neighborhood (album)|There Goes the Neighborhood]],'' but subsequent albums throughout the 1980s were less well received. During this period, Walsh performed as a session musician for [[Dan Fogelberg]], [[Steve Winwood]], [[John Entwistle]], [[Richard Marx]] and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer]], among others, and produced and co-wrote [[Ringo Starr]]'s ''[[Old Wave]]'' album.\n\nHenley achieved commercial solo success. In 1981, he sang a duet with [[Stevie Nicks]] ([[Fleetwood Mac]]), \"[[Leather and Lace (song)|Leather and Lace]]\". In 1982, he released ''[[I Can't Stand Still]],'' featuring the hit \"[[Dirty Laundry (Don Henley song)|Dirty Laundry]]\". The next album, ''[[Building the Perfect Beast]]'' (1984), featured \"[[The Boys of Summer (song)|The Boys of Summer]]\" (a ''Billboard'' number 5 hit), \"[[All She Wants to Do Is Dance]]\" (number 9), \"Not Enough Love in the World\" (number 34) and \"[[Sunset Grill (song)|Sunset Grill]]\" (number 22). Henley's next album, ''[[The End of the Innocence (album)|The End of the Innocence]]'' (1989), was also a major success. It included \"[[The End of the Innocence (song)|The End of the Innocence]]\", \"[[The Last Worthless Evening]]\" and \"[[The Heart of the Matter (song)|The Heart of the Matter]]\". His solo career was cut short due to a contract dispute with his record company, which was finally resolved when the Eagles reunited in 1994.\n\nFrey achieved solo success in the 1980s. In 1982, he released his first album, ''[[No Fun Aloud]]'', which spawned the number 15 hit \"[[The One You Love (Glenn Frey song)|The One You Love]]\". ''[[The Allnighter (album)|The Allnighter]]'' (1984) featured the number 20 hit \"Sexy Girl\". He reached number 2 on the charts with \"[[The Heat Is On (Glenn Frey song)|The Heat Is On]]\" from the ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]'' soundtrack. He had another number 2 single in 1985 with \"[[You Belong to the City]]\" from the ''[[Miami Vice]]'' soundtrack, which featured another Frey song, \"[[Smuggler's Blues]]\". He appeared as \"Jimmy\" in the episode titled after the song and contributed riffs to the episode's soundtrack. He also contributed the songs \"Flip City\" to the ''[[Ghostbusters II]]'' soundtrack and \"Part of Me, Part of You\" to the soundtrack for ''[[Thelma & Louise]].''\n\nFormer music writer [[Cameron Crowe]] had written articles about Poco and the Eagles during his journalism career. In 1982, his first screenplay was produced as the feature-length movie ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]].'' The film was co-produced by Eagles manager Azoff, who also co-produced the soundtrack album, released by Elektra. Henley, Walsh, Schmit, and Felder all contributed solo songs to the film's soundtrack. The band playing at the dance toward the end of the movie covers the Eagles song \"[[Life in the Fast Lane]]\".\n\nFelder released a solo album, and contributed two songs to the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'': \"[[Heavy Metal (Takin' a Ride)]]\" (with Henley and Schmit providing backing vocals) and \"All of You\". He also had a minor hit, \"Bad Girls\", off his solo album ''[[Airborne (Don Felder album)|Airborne]].''\n\nSchmit had a prolific solo career after the band's initial breakup. He had a hit song on the ''Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' soundtrack with \"[[So Much in Love]]\". He contributed vocals to the [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] album ''[[Daylight Again]]'' on the songs \"Southern Cross\" and \"[[Wasted on the Way]]\" when that band needed an extra vocalist due to [[David Crosby]]'s drug overindulgence. Schmit sang backup vocals on [[Toto (band)|Toto]]'s ''[[Toto IV]]'' album, including the song \"[[I Won't Hold You Back]]\" and appeared with the group on their 1982 European tour. He spent three years (1983\u20131985) as a member of [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s Coral Reefer band. He had a Top 40 solo hit in 1987 with \"Boys' Night Out\" and a top-30 Adult Contemporary hit with \"Don't Give Up\", both from his album ''Timothy B.'' Schmit appeared with Meisner and Walsh on [[Richard Marx]]'s debut single \"[[Don't Mean Nothing]]\". In 1992, Schmit and Walsh toured as members of Ringo Starr's [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]] and appeared on the live video from the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. Schmit released two solo albums, ''Playin' It Cool'' in 1984 and ''Tell Me the Truth'' in 1990. He was the only Eagle to appear on the 1993 Eagles tribute album ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]],'' singing backing vocals on [[Vince Gill]]'s cover of \"I Can't Tell You Why\".\n\nMeisner hit the top 40 three times, including the number 19 \"Hearts on Fire\" in 1981.\n\n===1994\u20132001: reunion, ''Hell Freezes Over''===\nAn Eagles country tribute album, titled ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]'', was released in 1993, 13 years after the breakup.

It included four new studio songs, with \"[[Get Over It (Eagles song)|Get Over It]]\" and \"[[Love Will Keep Us Alive]]\" both becoming Top 40 hits. The album proved successful, selling six million copies in the U.S.\n\nThe band subsequently embarked on a tour in 1994, which was interrupted in September because of Frey's serious recurrence of [[diverticulitis]], but it resumed in 1995 and continued into 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Great Gastro-Intestinal Saga of Glenn Frey (1994\u201395) |url= http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm |url-status= dead |archive-date= October 11, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011185039/http://eaglesonlinecentral.com/articles/illness.htm}}</ref> In 1998, the Eagles were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

Between 1994 and 1998, he appeared in the films ''Not Like Us'', ''[[Carnosaur 3: Primal Species]]'', ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'', ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'', and ''[[Richie Rich's Christmas Wish]]''.\n\nIn 1999, he signed with Grand Avenue Records and released ''All Night Long''.

A few months later, Fleetwood invited him to join the band The Zoo.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> For the Zoo's album ''I'm Not Me'' ([[RCA Records|RCA]], 1983) Burnette sang lead vocals on \"I'm Not Me\"; \"Angel Come Home\", a Beach Boys song; \"Gimme You\", a cover of his own song; and \"Tear It Up\", written by his father.\n\nIn 1982, the Zoo performed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as the backing band for [[Lindsey Buckingham]], guitarist and singer for Fleetwood Mac. In 1984, Burnette co-wrote the song \"So Excited\" with [[Christine McVie]], who sang and played keyboards in Fleetwood Mac. The song appeared on McVie's solo album, and Burnette appeared with her on MTV for ''Christine McVie: The Video Album''. He sang on the song \"Are You Mine\" with [[Stevie Nicks]], another Fleetwood Mac vocalist. The song was intended for Nicks's album ''Rock a Little'' but was not included. McVie and Fleetwood performed on Burnette's album ''Try Me'' ([[Curb Records|Curb]], 1985).<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Two songs cracked the ''Billboard'' country charts: \"Try Me\" and \"Ain't It Just Like Love\"\n\nWhen Lindsey Buckingham and Fleetwood Mac parted ways in 1987, Burnette and guitarist [[Rick Vito]] were asked to join the band.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> After the [[Shake the Cage Tour|Shake the Cage tour]], Fleetwood Mac released a ''[[Greatest Hits (1988 Fleetwood Mac album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album (1988), featuring two new songs with Burnette and Vito: \"[[As Long as You Follow]]\" and \"[[No Questions Asked (song)|No Questions Asked]]\".

Burnette helped Fleetwood Mac bassist [[John McVie]] with his first solo album. Burnette left Fleetwood Mac in early 1993 to pursue a solo and acting career.   In 1994, Burnette reunited with Fleetwood Mac. The band featured two new members, vocalist [[Bekka Bramlett]] and guitarist [[Dave Mason]]. The band toured in 1994 and 1995, and then released the album ''[[Time (Fleetwood Mac album)|Time]]'' (1995) on October 10, 1995.  Burnette wrote \"Talkin' to My Heart\" and \"I Got It in for You\" with [[Deborah Allen]].

Prior to the Eagles, he was a member of three country rock bands: [[Hearts & Flowers]], [[Dillard & Clark]], and [[the Flying Burrito Brothers]]. He is a multi-instrumentalist ([[guitar]], [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[steel guitar]], [[dobro]]) coming from a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] background. He introduced elements of this music to a mainstream audience during his tenure with the Eagles.\n\nLeadon's music career since leaving the Eagles has been low-key, resulting in two solo albums (the first actually being a collaborative project with Michael Georgiades) with a gap of 27 years in between. Leadon has also appeared on many other artists' records as a session musician.\n\n==Early life and musical beginnings==\n<!--Leadon was born in Minneapolis, one of ten siblings, to Bernard Leadon Jr. and Ann Teresa (n\u00e9e Sweetser) Leadon, devout [[Roman Catholic]]s. His father was an aerospace engineer and nuclear physicist whose career moved the family around the U.S. The family enjoyed music and, at an early age, Bernie developed an interest in folk and bluegrass music. He eventually mastered the 5-string banjo, mandolin and acoustic guitar.\n-->\n<!--As a young teen he moved with his family to San Diego, California, where he-->In San Diego, California, Leadon met fellow musicians Ed Douglas and Larry Murray of the local bluegrass outfit [[the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers]]. The Barkers proved a breeding ground for future California country rock talent, including shy, 18-year-old mandolin player [[Chris Hillman]], with whom Leadon maintained a lifelong friendship. Augmented by banjo player (and future Flying Burrito Brother) Kenny Wertz, the Squirrel Barkers eventually asked Leadon to join the group, upon Wertz's joining the [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] in 1963.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n<!--His stint in the Scottsville Squirrel Barkers did not last long. In late 1963, his family relocated to [[Gainesville, Florida]], when his father accepted a position as Professor of [[Aerospace Engineering]] at the [[University of Florida]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Leadon attended [[Gainesville High School (Florida)|Gainesville High School]], where-->He later met <!--classmate and--> future Eagles lead guitarist [[Don Felder]], whose band, the Continentals, had just lost guitarist [[Stephen Stills]]. <!--Upon Leadon's joining the group, rechristened Maundy Quintet, they gigged locally, even sharing the bill with future Gainesville legend [[Tom Petty]] and his early band the Epics (a band that also included Bernie's brother, musician [[Tom Leadon]]).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}-->\n\nA call from ex-Squirrel Barker Larry Murray in 1967 to join his fledgling psychedelic country-folk group Hearts & Flowers brought Leadon to California, where he became involved with the burgeoning L.A. folk/country rock scene. Leadon recorded one album with the band, its second release, ''Of Horses, Kids, and Forgotten Women'', for [[Capitol Records]]. The record was a local hit but failed to make much of a dent on the national album charts. Discouraged, the group disbanded the following year.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Dillard & Clark===\nBy late 1968, Leadon had befriended bluegrass/banjo legend [[Doug Dillard]], late of [[the Dillards]]. While staying with Dillard, informal jam sessions with songwriter and ex-[[Byrds]] member [[Gene Clark]] began to take shape, and morphed into what eventually became the country-rock band Dillard & Clark. In 1968, the group recorded ''[[The Fantastic Expedition of Dillard & Clark]]'', featuring Leadon's backing vocals and multi-instrumental work. The album included several compositions co-written with Clark, most notably the future Eagles staple (and somewhat of a signature song for Leadon) from their debut album, \"Train Leaves Here This Morning\".\n\n===The Flying Burrito Brothers===\n[[File:FlyingBurritos1970.jpg|thumb|Flying Burrito Brothers (Amsterdam, 1970). From left to right: [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]], [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], [[Chris Hillman]], [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]], Bernie Leadon]]\nLeadon left Dillard & Clark in 1969, eventually reconnecting with ex-Squirrel Barker (and ex-Byrd) Chris Hillman, who asked him to join the Flying Burrito Brothers, a fledgling country-rock band that Hillman had formed a year earlier with fellow ex-Byrd [[Gram Parsons]]. Leadon recorded two albums with the group: ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]'' and the post-Parsons LP [[The Flying Burrito Bros (album)|''The Flying Burrito Bros'']].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} After the latter album's release in 1971, Leadon had tired of the band's lack of commercial success and decided to leave the band to pursue an opportunity to play with three musicians he had worked with while moonlighting in [[Linda Ronstadt]]'s backing band that summer, forming the Eagles.\n\n==Eagles==\n\nLeadon was the last original member to join the Eagles,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} a band initially formed by guitarist/singer [[Glenn Frey]], drummer/singer [[Don Henley]], and former [[Poco (band)|Poco]] bassist/singer [[Randy Meisner]]. Leadon is often credited with helping shape the band's early country-rock sound, bringing his strong sense of harmony as well as his country, bluegrass and acoustic sensibilities to the group. Instruments he played during his tenure in the band were [[electric guitar]], [[B-Bender]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[dobro]] and [[pedal steel guitar]].\n\nUpon the release of their debut album, [[Eagles (album)|''Eagles'']], the group met with near instant success, due largely to the strength of their hit singles \"[[Take It Easy]]\", \"[[Peaceful Easy Feeling]]\" and \"[[Witchy Woman]]\" (co-written by Leadon and Henley), all of which highlighted Leadon's multi-instrumental talent and harmony vocals. Their follow-up, [[Desperado (Eagles album)|''Desperado'']], was another strong country-rock venture highlighted by the classics \"[[Tequila Sunrise (Eagles song)|Tequila Sunrise]]\" and the [[Desperado (Eagles song)|title track]]. Leadon had a prominent role on the album but it was met by surprisingly lukewarm reviews and lackluster sales. As a result, the band attempted to distance itself from the \"[[country rock]]\" label for their third album ''[[On the Border]]''. In doing so, Leadon encouraged the group to recruit his old friend, guitarist [[Don Felder]], to the band. The result was the guitar-heavy top 40 hit \"[[Already Gone (Eagles song)|Already Gone]]\". The album also included \"My Man\", Leadon's touching tribute to his old bandmate and friend [[Gram Parsons]], who had died of a drug overdose the year prior at [[Joshua Tree National Park|Joshua Tree National Monument]] in southeastern California.\n\nWith the wild success of ''[[On the Border]]'' and its follow-up smash, ''[[One of These Nights]]'', tension within the band grew with some sources saying Leadon grew increasingly frustrated by the band's direction away from his beloved country and bluegrass toward album-oriented stadium rock. He famously quit the band in 1975 by pouring a beer over Glenn Frey's head.<ref>Eliot, Marc (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=o_EjE6-iyQoC ''To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles'']{{Dead link|date=October 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, p. 131. Da Capo Press.</ref> He later cited a need to get healthy and break the vicious cycle of touring, recording and heavy drug use that was rampant within the band.\n\nUpon Leadon's departure, [[Asylum Records]] released ''[[Their Greatest Hits (1971\u20131975)]]'', which highlighted the band's Leadon years and went on to become the best-selling album in United States history, with sales in excess of 38 million units. He was replaced by former [[James Gang]] guitarist and singer [[Joe Walsh]].\n\nAlthough it has long been believed that he left because he was dissatisfied with the band moving into rock and roll, Leadon denies it and said in 2013, \"That's an oversimplification, it implies that I had no interest in rock or blues or anything but country rock. That's just not the case. I didn't just play [[Fender Telecaster]]. I played a [[Gibson Les Paul]] and I enjoyed [[rock & roll]]. That's evident from the early albums.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Greene |first=Andy |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/eagles-tour-will-feature-founding-guitarist-bernie-leadon-20130705 |title=Eagles Tour: Guitarist Bernie Leadon Will Reunite |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=July 5, 2013 |access-date=March 4, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Later career==\n[[File:Eagles in concert September 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|History of the Eagles tour, 2014.

He also had a short stint with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] in the late 1980s.\n\nIn 1993, he became a member of [[Run C&W]], a novelty group singing Motown hits \"bluegrass style\", recording two albums for [[MCA Records]].\n\nIn 1998, Leadon reunited with the Eagles in New York City for the band's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. All seven current and former Eagles members performed together on \"Take It Easy\" and \"[[Hotel California]]\".\n\nIn 2004, he released his second solo effort in 27 years (and his first under solely his name), ''Mirror''.\n\nLeadon toured with the Eagles from 2013 through 2015 during their [[History of the Eagles \u2013 Live in Concert|History of the Eagles Tour]]<ref name=\"Miami\">{{cite web|url=http://www.miami.com/review-eagles-bring-40-year-history-tour-and-taste-california-miami-s-americanairlines-arena-article|title=Review: Eagles bring 40-year 'History' Tour and taste of California to Miami's AmericanAirlines Arena|first=Howard|last=Cohen|work=[[Miami.com]]|date=November 23, 2013|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/music/ci_25025439/review-eagles-fly-through-history-lesson|title=Review: Eagles fly through history lesson|first=Jim|last=Harrington|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=January 30, 2014|access-date=January 21, 2016}}</ref> In 2015, Leadon appeared on producer [[Ethan Johns]]' third solo album, ''[[Silver Liner]]''.\n\nIn February 2016, Leadon appeared at the [[Grammy Awards]] ceremony with [[Jackson Browne]] and the surviving Eagles members - Don Henley, Joe Walsh, and [[Timothy B.

He has released 29 studio albums and three as a former member of [[Whiskeytown]].\n\nIn 2000, Adams left Whiskeytown and released his debut solo album, ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'', to critical acclaim. The album was nominated for the [[Shortlist Music Prize]]. The following year, his profile increased with the release of the UK certified-gold ''[[Gold (Ryan Adams album)|Gold]]'', which included the single \"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\". During this time, Adams worked on several unreleased albums, which were consolidated into a third solo release, ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]]'' (2002). Working at a prolific rate, Adams released the [[rock (album)|classic rock]]-influenced ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' (2003), after a planned album, ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', was rejected by his label [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]]. As a compromise, ''Love Is Hell'' was released as two EPs and eventually released in its full-length state in 2004.\n\nAfter breaking his wrist during a live performance, Ryan Adams took a hiatus and formed a backing band called [[Ryan Adams & the Cardinals|The Cardinals]], who supported him on his next four studio albums. In 2009, due to complications from [[M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease]], Adams disbanded The Cardinals and took a break from music.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ryan-adams-announces-split-from-the-cardinals-hiatus-20090114 |title=Ryan Adams announces split from the cardinals, hiatus|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 14, 2009}}</ref> However, he returned to the music scene in 2010, releasing his 13th studio album, ''[[Ashes & Fire]]''. Adams continued his musical journey by releasing his 14th album, ''[[Ryan Adams (album)|Ryan Adams]]'' in 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Adams gained attention for his cover album ''[[1989 (Ryan Adams album)|1989]]'', a song-for-song cover of [[Taylor Swift|Taylor Swift's]] album of the same name. In 2019, several women accused Adams of sexual harassment, leading to a delay in the release of three planned albums. Adams later issued an apology and eventually released six  more albums between 2020 and 2022. In addition to his own material, Adams has also produced albums for [[Willie Nelson]], [[Jesse Malin]], [[Jenny Lewis]], and [[Fall Out Boy]], and has collaborated with [[Counting Crows]], [[Weezer]], [[Norah Jones]], [[America (band)|America]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Leona Naess]], [[Toots and the Maytals]], [[Beth Orton]] and [[Krista Polvere]].

Whiskeytown was heavily influenced by a number of country-rock pioneers, most notably [[Gram Parsons]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Inman |first1=Davis |title=Pieces Of The Sky: The Legacy Of Gram Parsons |url=https://americansongwriter.com/pieces-of-the-sky-the-legacy-of-gram-parsons/?nab=1 |website=American Songwriter|date=May 18, 2012 }}</ref> The band quickly gained critical acclaim with the release of their second full-length album, ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'', their first [[Record label|major label]] release. A third album, ''[[Pneumonia (album)|Pneumonia]],'' was completed in 1999, but record label problems delayed its release. It was eventually released by [[Lost Highway Records|Lost Highway]] in 2001, at which time the band was effectively done.\n\n===Solo career (2000\u20132004)===\nAdams made his solo debut in 2000, with ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' (produced by [[Ethan Johns]]).<ref>[https://archive.today/20120712133705/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=112&csid2=4&fid1=26076 'Ryan Adams Grows Up'].

It was well received. Adams, however, initially refused to promote the record through radio station meet-and-greets and other music-industry conventions, instead opting for more recording and some live dates.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} A video was eventually made for the album's first single, \"[[New York, New York (Ryan Adams song)|New York, New York]]\". The music video featured Adams performing in front of the city's skyline four days before the [[September 11 attacks]]. The video was played often on [[MTV]] and [[VH1]] after the attacks and became Adams's breakthrough to mainstream music consumers.\n\nFollowing the success of ''Gold'', in 2002 Adams was blocked by his label from releasing his choice for a follow-up album. This would be the second time, the first being with ''Gold;'' Adams had recorded \"the Suicide Handbook\" which was rejected on the grounds that it was \"too sad\". The label opted this time around to cherry pick (without Adams' involvement) from four of Adams' recorded albums it had already dismissed as unreleasable (48 Hours, The Suicide Handbook, The Pinkhearts and The Swedish Sessions) to create ''[[Demolition (Ryan Adams album)|Demolition]],'' released in September 2002. Although the album garnered him more critical attention, it failed to sell as well as ''Gold''. The same year, Adams produced [[Jesse Malin]]'s first album, ''[[The Fine Art of Self Destruction]]'', and later worked with Malin to form the punk-rock group [[The Finger (band)|The Finger]] (under the pseudonyms, \"Warren Peace\" and \"Irving Plaza\" respectively), who released two E.P.s which were collected together to form ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'', released on [[One Little Indian Records]] in 2003. He also starred in a [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]] advertisement with Willie Nelson, performing a cover of Hank Williams's \"[[Move It On Over (song)|Move It on Over]]\".\n\nIn May 2002, Adams joined Elton John on ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'',<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202201350/http://www.cmt.com/shows/dyn/cmt_crossroads/59823/episode.jhtml | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 2, 2004 | title=CMT Crossroads: Elton John and Ryan Adams | access-date=April 11, 2007 | publisher = [[Country Music Television]]}}</ref> which brings together country artists with musicians from other genres. During the show, John referred to Adams as \"fabulous one\" and spoke of how ''Heartbreaker'' inspired him to record ''[[Songs from the West Coast]]'', which at the time was his most successful album in several years. Also in 2002, Adams reportedly recorded a cover of [[The Strokes]]' debut album ''[[Is This It]]'', though it has never been publicly released.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/ryan-adams/11149 | title=Adams Different Strokes in Demand! | access-date=April 11, 2007 | date=April 3, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 2002 and 2003, Adams worked on recording ''[[Love Is Hell (Ryan Adams album)|Love Is Hell]]'', intending to release it in 2003.

Yerington.<sup>[[The Finger (band)#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup> The name derived from notorious early/mid-1990s [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] rock band Finger, of which Adams was a big fan. This light-hearted project allowed both artists to return to their punk backgrounds (Adams began his music career as singer for The Patty Duke Syndrome and Malin began his career in the hardcore punk band [[Heart Attack (band)|Heart Attack]] and more famously as the lead singer of [[D Generation]]). They began by releasing two EPs: ''We Are Fuck You'' and ''Punk's Dead Let's Fuck'' which were later collected to form the album ''[[We Are Fuck You]]'' that was released in 2003.\n\nAdams and Lost Highway Records eventually agreed that the label would release ''[[Rock n Roll (Ryan Adams album)|Rock N Roll]]'' as well as ''Love Is Hell'', on the condition that ''Love Is Hell'' be split into two EP installments. ''Rock N Roll'' and ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 1'' were released in November 2003, followed by ''Love Is Hell, Pt. 2'' in December. Both albums were well received by critics, and in May 2004 ''Love Is Hell'' was re-released as a full-length album.\n\n''Love Is Hell'' included a cover of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis']] \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\", which Adams had previously performed live, and about which [[Noel Gallagher]] once said, \"I never got my head round this song until I went to [see] Ryan Adams play and he did an amazing cover of it.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nme.com/news/oasis/12909 | title = The 'Wonder' of Ryan | access-date=April 11, 2007| date=October 31, 2002 | publisher = [[NME]]/[[IPC Media]]}}</ref> The song earned Adams a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nomination for \"[[Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance|Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance]]\".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |title=Kanye West is at top of Grammy list |access-date=August 15, 2012 |date=December 8, 2004 |publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629020925/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2002112383_grammys08.html |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nWhile on tour to support ''Love Is Hell'' in January 2004, Adams fractured his wrist during a performance at the [[Royal Court Theatre, Liverpool|Royal Court Theatre]] in Liverpool.

Adams performed at subsequent outings of [[Phil Lesh and Friends]], including a two-night stand at [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]] outside of [[Denver]], Colorado and on New Year's Eve 2005 at the Bill Graham Event Center in San Francisco. Throughout 2006, Lesh's live performances included compositions by Adams, including several from ''Cold Roses'' (\"Cold Roses\", \"Let It Ride\", and \"Magnolia Mountain\").\n\nAdams produced [[Willie Nelson]]'s album ''[[Songbird (Willie Nelson album)|Songbird]]'', while he and The Cardinals performed as Nelson's backing band.

His most famous compositions include \"[[Werewolves of London]]\", \"[[Lawyers, Guns and Money]]\", and \"[[Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner]]\". All three songs are featured on his third album, ''[[Excitable Boy]]'' (1978), the title track of which is also well-known. He also wrote major hits that were recorded by other artists, including \"[[Poor Poor Pitiful Me]]\", \"Accidentally Like a Martyr\", \"[[Mohammed's Radio]]\", \"[[Carmelita (song)|Carmelita]]\", and \"[[Hasten Down the Wind (song)|Hasten Down the Wind]]\".\n\nZevon had early music industry successes as a session musician, jingle composer, songwriter, touring musician, musical coordinator, and bandleader. However, Zevon struggled to break through in his solo career until his music was performed by [[Linda Ronstadt]], beginning with her 1976 album ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]''. It launched a cult following that lasted 25 years, with Zevon making occasional returns to album and single charts until his death from [[mesothelioma]] in 2003. He briefly found a new audience by teaming up with members of [[R.E.M.]] in the [[blues rock]] outfit [[Hindu Love Gods (band)|Hindu Love Gods]] for a 1990 album release, although no tour followed. In 2023, Zevon was nominated for inclusion in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=2023 Nominees {{!}} Rock & Roll Hall of Fame |url=https://www.rockhall.com/2023-nominees |access-date=February 1, 2023 |website=www.rockhall.com}}</ref>\n\nKnown for his dry wit and acerbic lyrics, he was a guest numerous times on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nZevon was born in [[Chicago]], the son of Beverly Cope (n\u00e9e Simmons) and William Zevon.

[[Bones Howe]] produced their first single, the minor hit \"Follow Me\", which was written by Zevon and Santangelo and reached number 65 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot 100|pop charts]] in April 1966.

Though Zevon continued to play occasional live dates as a solo artist, the next several years of his career were dominated by session work with other musicians.\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Zevon toured regularly with [[The Everly Brothers]] as keyboard player, band leader, and musical coordinator.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone Bio\"/> Later the same decade, he toured with Don Everly and Phil Everly separately as they tried to launch solo careers after their breakup. He worked particularly closely with Phil, arranging and playing keyboards on his first and third solo albums (''Star Spangled Springer'' (1973) and ''Mystic Line'' (1975)) and co-writing tracks on his second and third albums (''Phil's Diner'' (1974) and the aforementioned ''Mystic Line''). Zevon's song \"[[Carmelita (song)|Carmelita]]\" was also recorded by Canadian singer [[Murray McLauchlan]] on his [[Murray McLauchlan (album)|self-titled album]] of 1972.\n\nThese small successes were not particularly rewarding financially, and Zevon's dissatisfaction with his career (and a lack of funds) led him to briefly move to [[Spain]] in the summer of 1975. He lived and played in the Dubliner Bar, a small tavern in [[Sitges]], near [[Barcelona]], owned by David Lindell, who was a mercenary. Together they composed \"[[Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner]]\".\n\n==Return to L.A. and major-label debut==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2018}}\n[[File:Warren Zevon 1976.jpg|thumb|right|Zevon in [[Heidelberg, Germany|Heidelberg]] as the opener for [[Jackson Browne]] in 1976.

The title tune is about a juvenile [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]]'s murderous prom night and referred to \"Little Susie\", the heroine of the song \"[[Wake Up Little Susie]]\" made famous by his former employers [[The Everly Brothers]]. Other songs such as \"[[Roland the Headless Thompson Gunner]]\" and \"[[Lawyers, Guns and Money]]\" used deadpan humor to wed geopolitical subtexts to hard-boiled narratives. Tracks from this album received heavy FM airplay, and the single release \"[[Werewolves of London]]\", which featured [[Mick Fleetwood]] and [[John McVie]], was a relatively lighthearted work featuring Zevon's signature macabre outlook that reached No. 21 on the charts.\n\nIn ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' (1979), critic [[Dave Marsh]] called Zevon \"one of the toughest rockers ever to come out of Southern California\".<ref>[[Dave Marsh|Marsh, Dave]]; Swenson, John, eds. (1979). ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The Rolling Stone Record Guide]]''. New York: Random House.</ref>{{Rp|427}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' record reviews editor [[Paul Nelson (critic)|Paul Nelson]] called the album \"one of the most significant releases of the 1970s\" and placed Zevon alongside [[Neil Young]], [[Jackson Browne]], and [[Bruce Springsteen]] as the four most important new artists to emerge in the decade. On May 11, 1980, Zevon and [[Willie Nile]] appeared on the [[King Biscuit Flower Hour]].\n\n[[File:LindaRonstadtPerforming.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Rondstadt singing into a microphone|Country rock musician [[Linda Ronstadt]] helped popularize Zevon's songs in the 1970s.]]\nZevon followed ''Excitable Boy'' with ''[[Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School]]'', in 1980. This album was dedicated to Ken Millar, better known under his nom-de-plume as the detective novelist [[Ross Macdonald]]. One of Zevon's literary heroes, Millar met the singer for the first time while participating in an [[intervention (counseling)|intervention]] organized by Nelson, which helped Zevon temporarily curtail his addictions. Featuring a modest hit with the single \"A Certain Girl\" (Zevon's cover of an [[R&B]] record by [[Ernie K-Doe]]) which reached No. 57 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart, the album sold briskly but was uneven, and represented a decline rather than commercial and critical consistency. It contained a collaboration with [[Bruce Springsteen]] on the song \"Jeannie Needs a Shooter\" and the ballad \"Empty-Handed Heart\" featuring a [[descant]] sung by [[Linda Ronstadt]], which is about Zevon's divorce from his wife, Crystal, the mother of his daughter Ariel; she has been erroneously described in some sources as his \"second wife\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Pollak |first=Sally |date=May 29, 2015 |title=Unplugged in Peacham: Ariel Zevon builds a life in NEK |url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/local/2015/05/29/unplugged-peacham-living-grid/28072963/ |work=Burlington Free Press |location=Burlington, VT}}</ref> (Marilyn \"Tule\" Livingston, the mother of his son, [[Jordan Zevon|Jordan]], and Zevon were in a long-term relationship but never married.)

The album also contains the first of Zevon's writing collaborations with respected writers of fiction: \"The Overdraft\", co-written with [[Thomas McGuane]]. The title track was dedicated to [[Philip Habib]], U.S. special envoy to the Middle East during the early 1980s. In the liner notes for the 1996 anthology ''I'll Sleep When I'm Dead'', Zevon stated that after the song came out, Habib sent him \"a very nice letter of appreciation on [[United States Department of State|State Department]] stationery\".<ref>Zevon, Warren.

Philadelphia Weekly.</ref> After ''The Envoy'' was poorly received by critics, [[Asylum Records]] ended their business relationship with Zevon, which Zevon discovered only when he read about it in the \"Random Notes\" column of ''Rolling Stone''. Following these career setbacks, he relapsed into drug and alcohol abuse. In 1984, he voluntarily checked himself into a rehab clinic in Minnesota. His relationship with Gevinson ended shortly thereafter.<ref name=\"Valania\"/> Zevon retreated from the music business for several years, except for playing live solo shows; during this time he finally overcame severe alcohol and drug addictions.\n\nDuring this time, Zevon collaborated with [[Bill Berry]], [[Peter Buck]] and [[Mike Mills]] (of [[R.E.M.]]), and backup vocalist Bryan Cook to form a minor project called [[Hindu Love Gods (band)|Hindu Love Gods]]. The group released the non-charting single \"Narrator\" for [[IRS Records]] in 1984, then went into abeyance for several years.\n\nBerry, Buck and Mills served as the core of Zevon's next studio band when he re-emerged in 1987 by signing with [[Virgin Records]] and recording the album ''[[Sentimental Hygiene]]''. The release, hailed as his best since ''Excitable Boy'', featured a thicker rock sound and taut, often humorous songs like \"Detox Mansion\", \"Bad Karma\" (which featured [[R.E.M.]] lead singer [[Michael Stipe]] on backup vocals), and \"Reconsider Me\". Included were contributions from [[Neil Young]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], [[Brian Setzer]], and [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], as well as Berry, Buck, and Mills. Also on hand were Zevon's longtime collaborators [[Jorge Calder\u00f3n]] and [[Waddy Wachtel]].\n\nDuring the ''Sentimental Hygiene'' sessions, Zevon also participated in an all-night jam session with Berry, Buck and Mills, as they worked their way through rock and blues numbers by artists including [[Bo Diddley]], [[Muddy Waters]], [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. Though the sessions were not initially intended for release, they eventually were as [[Hindu Love Gods (band)|Hindu Love Gods']] [[Hindu Love Gods (album)|sole album]].\n\nThe immediate follow-up to ''Sentimental Hygiene'' was 1989's ''[[Transverse City]]'', a futuristic [[concept album]] inspired by Zevon's interest in the work of [[cyberpunk]] science fiction author [[William Gibson]]. It featured guests including [[Little Feat]] drummer [[Richie Hayward]], [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Hot Tuna]] bassist [[Jack Casady]], noted jazz keyboardist [[Chick Corea]] and various guitarists, including Wachtel, [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Jorma Kaukonen]], [[David Gilmour]] and [[Neil Young]]. Key tracks include the title song, \"Splendid Isolation\", \"Run Straight Down\" (which had a promotional video that featured Zevon singing in a factory while Gilmour played guitar solos), and \"They Moved the Moon\" (one of Zevon's eerier ballads).\n\n==Later years and second comeback==\n''Transverse City'' was a commercial disappointment, and Zevon was dropped by Virgin Records soon after the album's release. He almost immediately contracted, however, with [[Irving Azoff]]'s new label [[Giant Records (Warner Bros. subsidiary label)|Giant Records]]. The first release under Zevon's contract with his new distributor was the album ''[[Hindu Love Gods (album)|Hindu Love Gods]]'', recorded during the ''Sentimental Hygiene'' sessions. The album included a cover of [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s \"[[Raspberry Beret]]\", which became a number 23 Modern Rock hit in the United States.\n\nIn 1991, Zevon who once again was a solo artist, released ''[[Mr. Bad Example]]''. The album featured the modest pop hit \"Searching for a Heart\" and the rocker \"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead\", later used as the title of the [[neo-noir]] [[Things To Do In Denver When You're Dead|film of the same name]], directed by [[Gary Fleder]]; after some skirmishing over the unauthorized use of Zevon's song title, the Zevon track was licensed to play over the film's end credits. Zevon also sang lead vocals on the song \"Casey Jones\" from the Grateful Dead tribute album ''[[Deadicated]]'', with regular collaborator David Lindley.\n\nZevon toured the United States (with the [[Odds (band)|Odds]]), Europe, Australia and New Zealand during this period. Owing to his reduced circumstances, his performances were often true solo efforts with minimal accompaniment on piano and guitar;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/noevalleyvoice167unse|title=Noe Valley Voice|date=October 1, 1992|publisher=Sarah Smith & Jack Tipple|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/THE-MUSIC-MAN-2507072.php|title=The Music Man|date=January 8, 2006|publisher=[[SFGate]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|access-date=March 31, 2018|title=Music Series Bids Farewell to Ministry Stage: Reprise Possible in Two Years|author=World, Heather|url=http://www.noevalleyvoice.com/2010/November/NVMS.htm|website=Noevalleyvoice.com|date=November 2010}}</ref> the live album ''[[Learning to Flinch]]'' (1993) documents such a tour.

Zevon also served as musical coordinator and occasional guitarist for an ad-hoc rock music group called the [[Rock Bottom Remainders]], a collection of writers performing rock-and-roll standards at book fairs and other events. The group included [[Stephen King]], [[Dave Barry]], [[Matt Groening]] and [[Amy Tan]], among other popular writers; it has continued to perform one benefit concert per year since Zevon's death.\n\nAn affiliated project for which Zevon both played and wrote liner notes is the offbeat 1998 album ''[[Stranger Than Fiction (Rock Bottom Remainders album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]'', a two-CD set attributed to the Wrockers, containing rock covers and originals by many of the Remainders authors plus such notables as [[Norman Mailer]] and [[Maya Angelou]]. Zevon oversaw music for the short-lived revival of the [[NBC]] series ''[[Route 66 (television series)|Route 66]]'' (1993), contributing that show's main title theme, \"If You Won't Leave Me I'll Find Somebody Who Will\". His music was also featured in the four [[William Shatner]] ''[[TekWar]]'' movies in 1994. Zevon is listed as \"theme music composer\" in the opening credits. His song \"Real or Not\" was used as the show's end credit theme song. The song appeared on Zevon's 2-CD set, ''I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (An Anthology)''. In the accompanying booklet, Zevon wrote, \"I wrote this song for the William Shatner TV movies based on his novels. He ''is'' Captain Kirk, rest assured. He'd call me at home and demand to hear the song in progress, then he'd say \"We need more guitars! More driving guitars!\" It was cool. The track reflected my secret fondness for sleazy English techno records.\"\n\nOccasionally between 1982 and 2001, Zevon filled in for [[Paul Shaffer]] as bandleader on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' and later the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.\n\nIn 1995, Zevon released the self-produced ''[[Mutineer (album)|Mutineer]]''. The title track was frequently covered by Bob Dylan on his U.S. fall tour in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bjorner.com/2002%206%207.htm |title=Dylan Set Lists at Olaf's Files for 2002|publisher=Bjorner.com |access-date=June 29, 2010}}</ref> Zevon's cover of cult artist [[Judee Sill]]'s \"Jesus Was a Crossmaker\" predated the wider rediscovery of her work a decade later. The album, however, had the worst sales of Zevon's career, in part because of lack of promotion from his label, Giant. [[Rhino Records]] released a Zevon \"best-of\" compilation in 1996, ''[[I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (An Anthology)|I'll Sleep When I'm Dead]]''. Zevon also appeared on the ''[[Larry Sanders Show]]'' on [[HBO]], in 1993, playing himself as a guest on the show, promoting ''[[Learning to Flinch]]''. Zevon also played himself on two episodes of ''[[Suddenly Susan]]'' in 1999, along with singer and actor [[Rick Springfield]].\n\n[[File:David Letterman 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|Comedian and TV host [[David Letterman]] was credited by Zevon as \"being the best friend my music ever had\".<ref name=\"nyt-last\"/>]]\n\nAfter another five-year layoff, Zevon signed with industry veteran Danny Goldberg's [[Artemis Records]] and again rebounded with the mortality-themed 2000 release ''[[Life'll Kill Ya]]'', containing the hymn-like \"Don't Let Us Get Sick\" and an austere version of [[Steve Winwood]]'s 1980s hit \"Back in the High Life Again\". With record sales brisk and music critics giving Zevon his best notices since ''Excitable Boy'', ''[[Life'll Kill Ya]]'' is seen as his second comeback. He followed with the album ''[[My Ride's Here]]'' (2002), with its morbid prescience of things to come; the album included \"Hit Somebody! (The Hockey Song)\" (co-written by [[Mitch Albom]], the author of ''[[Tuesdays with Morrie]]'', and featuring [[Paul Shaffer]], the ''Late Night'' band, and a spoken vocal from TV host [[David Letterman]]) and the ballad \"Genius\"\u2014written with Pulitzer Prize and T.S. Eliot Prize-winning poet, Paul Muldoon\u2014later used as the title of an anthology of Zevon's recordings in 2002.\n\nAt about this time, he and the actor [[Billy Bob Thornton]] formed a close friendship, catalyzed by their common experiences with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and the fact they lived in the same apartment building.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />  In 2000, Zevon appeared with Thornton in the movie [[South of Heaven, West of Hell]], written and directed by [[Dwight Yoakam]].

After a period of suffering with pain and shortness of breath, Zevon was encouraged by his dentist to see a physician; he was diagnosed with pleural [[mesothelioma]], a cancer (usually caused by exposure to asbestos) that affects the [[Pulmonary pleurae|pleura]], a thin membrane around the lungs and chest lining.

The book is largely an oral history that consists of interviews with Zevon's friends, relatives and associates, as well as excerpts from his diaries. Crystal Zevon said Warren had given her permission to use the journal excerpts and instructed her to present an unvarnished portrayal of his life that did not sanitize his many struggles.\n\nGeorge Plasketes, a professor at [[Auburn University]], wrote a critical study of Zevon's music in 2016, ''Warren Zevon, Desperado of Los Angeles''. Zevon was also the subject of Michael Flood's essay \"Lord Byron's Luggage: Warren Zevon and the Redefinition of Literature Rock\". A collection of short stories by Kelly Lynn Thomas, ''Miss Gun to a Knife Fight: Stories'', is composed of retellings of songs by Zevon.\n\nIn 2012, George Gruel, a photographer who worked as Zevon's aide-de-camp from 1978 to 1983, published a book of photos of Zevon.

The band included Seger on guitar, piano, keyboards, and vocals, Pete Stanger on guitar, and R.B. Hunter on drums. All of the members attended Ann Arbor High. The Decibels recorded an [[acetate disc|acetate]] demo of a song called \"The Lonely One\", at [[Del Shannon]]'s studio in 1961. As well as being Seger's first original song, \"The Lonely One\" was Seger's first song to be played on the radio, airing only once on an Ann Arbor radio station.<ref name=oral>{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20070312/ENT04/103120103/|title=A definitive oral history of Seger's early years|author=Brian McCollum| newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|date=March 14, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413173516/http://www.freep.com/article/20070312/ENT04/103120103/|archive-date=April 13, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Goldmine>{{cite news | author=Joanne Zangrilli | title=Going the Distance | magazine=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]] | date=November 1990}}</ref> In 2021, a recording of \"The Lonely One\" resurfaced, and was broadcast (with permission from Seger) twice on [[WCSX]]-FM in Detroit, on the mornings of March 15 and 16.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/03/12/first-bob-seger-song-ever-recorded-play-wcsx-monday/4664560001/|title=First Bob Seger song ever recorded to play on WCSX Monday|author=Melody Baetens| newspaper=[[The Detroit News]]|date=March 12, 2021}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Decibels disbanded, Seger joined the Town Criers, a four-piece band with Seger on lead vocals, John Flis on bass, Pep Perrine on drums, and Larry Mason on lead guitar. The Town Criers, covering songs like \"[[Louie Louie]]\", began gaining a steady following. Meanwhile, Seger was listening to [[James Brown]] and said that, for him and his friends, ''[[Live at the Apollo (1963 album)|Live at the Apollo]]'' was their favorite record following its release in 1963. Seger was also influenced by the music of [[The Beatles]], once they hit American shores in 1964. In general, he and local musician friends such as [[Glenn Frey]] (later a member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]) bought into the premises of 1960s pop and rock radio, with its hook-driven hits; he later recalled himself and Frey thinking at the time, \"You're nobody if you can't get on the radio.\"<ref name=\"cst-2011\"/>\n\n=== Doug Brown & The Omens ===\nAs the Town Criers began landing more gigs, Seger met a man named Doug Brown, backed by a band called The Omens. Seger joined Doug Brown & The Omens, who had a bigger following than the Town Criers. While Brown was the primary lead vocalist for the group, Seger would take the lead on some songs\u2014covering [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] numbers.<ref name=oral/> With this group, Seger first appeared on an officially released recording: the 1965 single \"TGIF\" backed with \"First Girl\", credited to Doug Brown and The Omens. Seger later appeared on Doug Brown and The Omens' parody of [[Barry Sadler]]'s song \"[[Ballad of the Green Berets]]\" which was re-titled \"Ballad of the Yellow Beret\" and mocked [[draft evader]]s. Soon after its release, Sadler and his record label threatened Brown and his band with a lawsuit, and the recording was withdrawn from the market.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Rolling Stone Editors. ''The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll: Revised and Updated for the 21st Century''. New York: Fireside, 2001.</ref>\n\nWhile Seger was a member of The Omens, he met his longtime manager [[Punch Andrews|Edward \"Punch\" Andrews]], who at the time was partnered with Dave Leone running the Hideout franchise, which consisted of four club locations from Clawson to Rochester Hills, where local acts would play, and a small-scale record label. Seger began writing and producing for other acts that Punch was managing, such as the Mama Cats and the Mushrooms (with Frey). Seger and Brown were then approached by Punch and Leone to write a song for the Underdogs, another local band who recently had a hit with a song called \"Man in the Glass\". Seger contributed a song called \"[[East Side Story (Bob Seger song)|East Side Story]]\", which was not successful.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n=== The Last Heard ===\nSeger decided to record \"East Side Story\" himself, and officially left the Omens (though he did retain Brown as a producer). As Bob Seger and the Last Heard, Seger released his version of the song with Hideout Records in January 1966, and it became his first big Detroit hit. The single (backed with \"East Side Sound\", an instrumental version of \"East Side Story\") sold 50,000 copies, mostly in the Detroit area, and led to a contract with [[Cameo-Parkway Records]]. Though the name \"The Last Heard\" originally referred to the collection of Omens and Town Criers who recorded \"East Side Story\" with Seger, it soon became the name of Seger's permanent band, which consisted of former Town Crier Pep Perrine on drums, Carl Lagassa on guitar, and Dan Honaker on bass. Following \"East Side Story\", the group released four more singles: the [[James Brown]]-inspired holiday single \"Sock It to Me Santa\", the [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]]-esque \"Persecution Smith\", \"Vagrant Winter\", and perhaps the most notable, \"[[Heavy Music]]\", released in 1967. \"Heavy Music\", which sold even more copies than \"East Side Story\", had the potential to break out nationally when Cameo-Parkway suddenly went out of business. It was a top 100 hit in Canada, where it topped out on the national RPM charts at {{Numero|82}}; in the US, it just missed the Hot 100, peaking on the \"bubbling under\" chart at {{Numero|103}}. The song would stay in Seger's live act for many years to come.\n\n=== The Bob Seger System ===\nAfter Cameo-Parkway folded, Seger and Punch began searching for a new label. In the spring of 1968, Bob Seger & the Last Heard signed with major label [[Capitol Records]], turning down [[Motown Records]], who offered more money than Capitol. Seger felt that Capitol was more appropriate for his genre than Motown.<ref name=oral/>\n\nCapitol changed the name of the band to The Bob Seger System. In the transition between labels, guitarist Carl Lagassa left the band and keyboard player Bob Schultz joined. The System's first single with Capitol was the anti-war message song \"[[2 + 2 = ?]]\", which reflected a marked change in Seger's political attitudes from \"The Ballad of the Yellow Beret\". The single was again a hit in Detroit and hit number 1 on radio stations in [[Buffalo, New York]] and [[Orlando, Florida]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=14146 | title=Bob Seger System \u2013 2 + 2 = ? <nowiki>[1968]</nowiki> | publisher=ARSA <!-- access-date=unknown --> | access-date=August 18, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808054306/http://las-solanas.com/arsa/charts_item.php?hsid=14146 | archive-date=August 8, 2014 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> but went unnoticed almost everywhere else, and failed to chart nationally in the US. The single did, however, make the Canadian national charts, peaking at {{Numero|79}}.\n\nThe second single from The Bob Seger System was \"[[Ramblin' Gamblin' Man (song)|Ramblin' Gamblin' Man]]\". It was a major hit in [[Michigan]], and it also became Seger's first national hit, peaking at {{Numero|17}}. The song's success led to the release of an album of the same title in 1969. The ''[[Ramblin' Gamblin' Man]]'' album reached {{Numero|62}} on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' pop albums chart]]. Glenn Frey had his first studio gig singing back-up and playing guitar on \"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\".<ref>''[[History of the Eagles]]''. Sundance Institute, 2013</ref>\n\nSeger was unable to follow up on this success. For the next album, singer-songwriter Tom Neme joined The System, ultimately writing and singing the majority of the tunes featured, for which the group was heavily criticized. The album called ''[[Noah (The Bob Seger System album)|Noah]]'' (1969), failed to chart at all, leading Seger to briefly quit the music industry and attend college. He returned the following year and put out the System's final album, 1970's ''[[Mongrel (The Bob Seger System album)|Mongrel]]'', this time without Neme. Bob Schultz left the band as well, being replaced by Dan Watson. ''Mongrel'', with the powerful single \"[[Lucifer (Bob Seger song)|Lucifer]]\", was considered to be a strong album by many critics and Detroit fans, but failed to do well commercially.\n\nThe Bob Seger System was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |last=Advertising |first=OJ |title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends - Bob Seger System (a.k.a.

For a short period following the breakup, Seger had ambitions to be a one-man act.<ref name=\"travelin man\">Tom Weschler and [[Gary Graff]].

Detroit, Michigan: Wayne State University Press, 2009.</ref> In 1971, he released his first solo album, the all-acoustic ''[[Brand New Morning (Bob Seger album)|Brand New Morning]]''.

Together they recorded ''[[Smokin' O.P.'s]]'' (1972), released on Punch Andrews' own Palladium Records. The album mainly consisted of covers, spawning a minor hit with a version of [[Tim Hardin]]'s \"[[If I Were a Carpenter (song)|If I Were a Carpenter]]\" ({{Numero|76}} the US), though it did feature \"Someday\", a new Seger original, and a re-release of \"Heavy Music\". The album reached 180 on the Billboard 200.\n\nAfter spending most of 1972 touring with Teegarden & Van Winkle, Seger left the duo to put together a new backing band, referred to as both My Band and the Borneo Band, made up of musicians from [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. [[Jamie Oldaker]], Dick Sims, and [[Marcy Levy]] were all members of My Band before joining [[Eric Clapton]]'s backing band. In 1973, Seger put out ''[[Back in '72]]'', recorded partly with the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]], a renowned group of [[session musician]]s who had recorded with the likes of [[J. J. Cale]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"segerfile_72\">[http://www.segerfile.com/72.html Segerfile.com: Back in '72] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731205642/http://www.segerfile.com/72.html |date=July 31, 2015 }}. \"Working with Muscle Shoals\". Excerpted from Chris Cioe, [[Musician (magazine)|Musician]]. \"Bob Seger: Hymns from the heartland\".</ref> According to Seger, there was a financial misunderstanding with the musicians: they offered to record him \"for $1500 a side\", which he took to mean $1500 per album side. When he found out that they meant $1500 per song, he left after recording three songs but resolved to work with them in the future.<ref name=\"segerfile_72\"/> ''Back in '72'' featured the studio version of Seger's later live classic \"[[Turn the Page (Bob Seger song)|Turn the Page]]\"; \"Rosalie\", a song Seger wrote about [[CKLW]] music director [[Rosalie Trombley]] (and which was later recorded by [[Thin Lizzy]]); and \"[[I've Been Working]]\", a song originally by [[Van Morrison]], a strong influence on Seger's musical development.{{refn|Mentioning [[Frankie Miller]], covering Miller's song \"Ain't Got No Money\" on ''[[Stranger in Town (album)|Stranger in Town]]'' album, and also [[Graham Parker]], [[John Fogerty]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]], Seger has remarked: \"There's a whole little clique of male vocalists. We're just sort of all connected. I think every last one of us has a connection with Van Morrison.\"<ref name=\"Influences\"/>}} Despite the strength of Seger's backup musicians, the album only reached 188 on the US charts and has since faded into obscurity. Even so, ''Back in '72'' and its supporting tour mark the beginnings of Seger's long-time relationships with future Silver Bullet Band saxophonist [[Alto Reed]], powerhouse female vocalist [[Shaun Murphy (singer)|Shaun Murphy]], and the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section. Over the tour, My Band would prove to be unreliable, which frustrated Seger. By the end of 1973, Seger had left My Band in search of a new backing band. Throughout 1974\u201375, Seger continued to perform in local venues around his hometown while known as the Bob Seger Group including one renowned concert in Davisburg, Michigan, called the \"Battle of the Bands\".\n\n=== The Silver Bullet Band ===\n[[File:Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band 1977.JPG|thumb|Seger (bottom right) and the Silver Bullet Band in 1977]]\nIn 1974, Seger formed the Silver Bullet Band. Its original members were guitarist [[Drew Abbott]], drummer and backing vocalist Charlie Allen Martin, keyboardist and backing vocalist Rick Manasa, bass guitarist Chris Campbell, and saxophonist and backing vocalist [[Alto Reed]]. With this new band sitting in occasionally, Seger released the album ''[[Seven (Bob Seger album)|Seven]]'' (1974), which contained the Detroit-area hard-rock hit \"Get Out of Denver\". This track was a modest success and charted at {{Numero|80}} nationally.\n\nIn 1975, Seger returned to Capitol Records and released the album ''[[Beautiful Loser]]'', with help from the Silver Bullet Band (with new keyboardist Robyn Robbins replacing Manasa) on his cover of the [[Tina Turner]] penned \"[[Nutbush City Limits]]\". The album's single \"[[Katmandu (Bob Seger song)|Katmandu]]\" which was featured in the 1985 movie ''[[Mask (1985 film)|Mask]]'' starring [[Cher]] (in addition to being another substantial Detroit-area hit) was Seger's first real national break-out track since 1968's \"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\". Although it just missed the US Pop Top 40 \u2013 peaking at {{Numero|43}} \u2013 the song received strong airplay in several markets nationwide including Detroit.\n\nIn April 1976, Seger and the Silver Bullet Band released the album ''[[Live Bullet]]'', recorded over two nights in Detroit's [[Cobo Arena]] in September 1975. It contained Seger's rendition of \"Nutbush City Limits\" as well as Seger's classic take on life on the road, \"[[Turn the Page (Bob Seger song)|Turn the Page]]\", from ''Back in '72''. It also included his late 1960s successful releases \u2013 \"Heavy Music\" and \"Ramblin' Gamblin' Man\". Critic [[Dave Marsh]] later wrote that \"''Live Bullet'' is one of the best live albums ever made ... In spots, particularly during the medley of \"Travelin' Man\"/\"Beautiful Loser\" on side one, Seger sounds like a man with one last shot at the top.\"<ref name=\"p. 454\">{{cite book|author=Dave Marsh|author-link=Dave Marsh|author2=John Swenson|title=[[New Rolling Stone Record Guide]]|year=1983|publisher=Rolling Stone Press/Random House|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-394-72107-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstoner00mars/page/454 454\u2013455]}}</ref> An instant best-seller in Detroit, ''Live Bullet'' began to get attention in other parts of the country, selling better than Seger's previous albums, getting [[progressive rock (radio format)|progressive rock radio]] and [[album-oriented rock]] airplay, and enabling Seger to headline more shows.<ref name=\"greil-nm\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6N9LAAAAIBAJ&pg=5806,3977654 |title= Bob Seger Never Forgets | author=Greil Marcus | author-link=Greil Marcus | newspaper=[[The Village Voice]] | date=December 13, 1976}}</ref> But Seger still had a popularity imbalance; in June 1976, he was a featured performer at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] outside Detroit in front of nearly 80,000 fans, but one night later played to fewer than a thousand people in Chicago.<ref>{{cite news | author=Mary Campbell | title=Bob Seger to storm into Poplar Creek with rock poetry | newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date=July 25, 1986}}</ref>\n\n== Peak of success: 1976\u20131987 ==\n[[File:Bob Seger 1977.JPG|thumb|Seger in 1977]]\nSeger finally achieved his commercial breakthrough with his October 1976 album ''[[Night Moves (album)|Night Moves]]''.

''Night Moves'' was Seger's first top-ten album in the Billboard album chart, and as of 2006 was certified at 6 million copies in the United States, making it the biggest-selling studio album of his entire career. The success of ''Night Moves'' also bolstered sales of Seger's previous releases. Seger's 1975 release ''Beautiful Loser'' would eventually sell two million copies and the 1976 album ''Live Bullet'' would go on to sell six million copies in the United States.

Despite the loss of Martin, Seger's 1978 album ''[[Stranger in Town (album)|Stranger in Town]]'' was also a success. The first single, \"[[Still the Same (Bob Seger song)|Still the Same]]\", reached {{Numero|4}} on the ''Billboard Hot 100''. \"[[Hollywood Nights (song)|Hollywood Nights]]\" reached {{Numero|12}} on the same chart, while the ballad \"[[We've Got Tonite|We've Got Tonight]]\" reached {{Numero|13}}. \"We've Got Tonight\" was a major hit again when it was covered in 1983 by country music superstar [[Kenny Rogers]] and pop singer [[Sheena Easton]]. Notably, it topped ''Billboard's'' [[Hot Country Songs]] and peaked at {{Numero|2}} and {{Numero|6}} on ''Billboard's'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] and [[Hot 100]] charts respectively.  \"[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]\", a song from George Jackson and Thomas E. Jones III that Seger substantially rewrote the lyrics for,<ref name=\"cst-2011\"/><ref>K. Sharp, ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'', Issue 102, page 59. Future Publishing, 2007.</ref> peaked at {{Numero|28}} on the Hot 100, but achieved greater popularity after being featured in the 1983 [[Tom Cruise]] film ''[[Risky Business]]'', in which Tom Cruise's character dances in his underwear to the song. It has since been ranked the second-most played Jukebox Single of all time, behind [[Patsy Cline]]'s \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\".<ref name=\"cst-2011\"/> \"Old Time Rock and Roll\" was named one of the [[Songs of the Century]] in 2001. Seger has since remarked that not taking one-third writing credit on his recording was, financially,  \"the dumbest thing I ever did\".<ref name=\"cst-2011\"/>\n\nSeger also co-wrote the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' {{Numero|1}} hit song \"[[Heartache Tonight]]\" from their 1979 album ''[[The Long Run (album)|The Long Run]]'';<ref name=\"cst-2011\"/> their collaboration about Seger's and [[Glenn Frey]]'s shared early lives in Detroit.\n\nIn 1980, Seger released ''[[Against the Wind (album)|Against the Wind]]'' (with ex-[[Grand Funk Railroad]] member [[Craig Frost]] replacing Robyn Robbins on keyboards) and it became his first and only {{Numero|1}} album on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' album chart. The first single \"[[Fire Lake]]\" featured Eagles [[Don Henley]], [[Timothy B. Schmit]], and [[Glenn Frey]] on backing vocals and Muscle Shoals guitarist [[Pete Carr]] on 12-string acoustic.  Fire Lake reached {{Numero|6}} on the Hot 100, while the title song \"[[Against the Wind (Bob Seger song)|Against the Wind]]\" reached {{Numero|5}} as a single and even crossed over to the Top 10 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart. \"[[You'll Accomp'ny Me]]\" became the third hit single from the record, reaching {{Numero|14}}. ''Against the Wind'' would also win two [[Grammy Awards]]. As of 2006, both ''Stranger in Town'' and ''Against the Wind'' had sold over 5 million copies each in the United States.\n\nThe live 1981 album ''[[Nine Tonight]]'' encapsulated this three-album peak of Seger's commercial career. Seger's take on Eugene Williams' \"[[Tryin' to Live My Life Without You]]\" became a Top Five hit from ''Nine Tonight'' and the album would go on to sell 4 million copies.\n\nSeger released the acclaimed ''[[The Distance (Bob Seger album)|The Distance]]'' in December 1982. During the recording of this album, Silver Bullet guitarist Drew Abbott left the band due to his frustration with Seger's frequent use of session musicians in the studio and was replaced by [[Dawayne Bailey]]. After the album's release, David Teegarden also left the band due to internal conflict and was replaced by ex-[[Grand Funk]] drummer [[Don Brewer]]. Critically praised for representing a more versatile sound than that of his recent material, ''The Distance'' spawned numerous hits beginning with [[Rodney Crowell]]'s \"[[Shame on the Moon]]\". It was the biggest hit of the Silver Bullet Band's entire career, hitting {{Numero|1}} on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart and holding at {{Numero|2}} for four consecutive weeks \u2013 behind [[Patti Austin]] and [[James Ingram]]'s \"[[Baby, Come to Me (Patti Austin and James Ingram song)|Baby, Come to Me]]\" and [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\" \u2013 on the Hot 100. It also crossed over to {{Numero|15}} on ''Billboard''{{'s}} [[Hot Country Songs|Country Singles]] chart. The follow-up single, \"Even Now\", just missed the Top 10, and \"[[Roll Me Away]]\" peaked at {{Numero|27}}. The driving album track \"Making Thunderbirds\" was a popular music video filmed in Detroit and well-received on [[MTV]]. Seger's multi-platinum sales dropped off at this point, with ''The Distance'' peaking at {{Numero|5}} and selling only 1.9 million copies in the United States. ''The Distance'' was belatedly released on [[8-track tape]]; Capitol reportedly had no plans to do so, but Seger, claiming that many of his fans still used 8-track players in their vehicles, requested that the label also release the album in the waning format.\n\nIn 1984, Seger wrote and recorded the power rock ballad \"Understanding\" for the film soundtrack ''[[Teachers (film)|Teachers]]''. The song was another Top 20 hit for Seger in late 1984.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} In 1986, he wrote and recorded \"Living Inside My Heart\" for the film soundtrack of ''[[About Last Night (1986 film)|About Last Night...]]''.\n\nSeger was no longer as prolific, and several years elapsed before his next studio album, ''[[Like a Rock]],'' emerged in the spring of 1986. The fast-paced \"American Storm\" was another Top-20 single aided by a popular music video featuring actress [[Lesley Ann Warren]], and \"[[Like a Rock (song)|Like a Rock]]\" followed, reaching {{Numero|12}} on Billboard's Hot 100. Later, it would become familiar to many Americans through its association with a long-running [[Chevrolet]] [[ad campaign]] (something Seger explicitly chose to do to support struggling American automobile workers in Detroit).<ref>{{cite news | author=Roger Catlin | date=April 12, 1996 | newspaper=[[Hartford Courant]] | title=Bob Seger's back \u2013 with his kids }}</ref> Seger's 1986\u20131987 American Storm Tour was his self-stated last major tour, playing 105 shows over nine months and selling almost 1.5 million tickets.

A synth-driven pop-rock song, it was Seger's first and only {{Numero|1}} hit on the pop singles chart. The song had originally been intended for fellow Detroiter [[Glenn Frey]], but when Frey lost his voice just before the recording session, he asked Seger to take his place. Seger changed the verses of the song but kept the chorus the same. The song earned Seger an Academy Award nomination as co-writer in the Best Original Song category the following year.\n\n== Later years: 1988\u2013present ==\nBob Seger's next record was 1991's ''[[The Fire Inside (Bob Seger album)|The Fire Inside]]'', at a time when [[glam metal]], [[grunge]] and [[alternative rock]] were taking the forefront. His new music found little visibility on the radio or elsewhere. The same was true of 1995's ''[[It's a Mystery]]'', although the album was certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] (500,000 copies sold). However, in 1994, Seger released ''[[Greatest Hits (Bob Seger album)|Greatest Hits]]''; the compilation album was his biggest-ever record in terms of sales, selling nearly 10 million copies in the United States {{as of|2010|lc=y}}. Seger did go back on the road again for a 1996 tour, which was successful and sold the fourth-largest number of tickets of any North American tour that year. (Seger was once known for his concerts in small venues, as witnessed with his appearance at the 18th Amendment in Omaha, Nebraska.)\n\nSeger took a sabbatical from the music business for about ten years to spend time with his wife and two young children. In 2001 and 2002, Seger won the prestigious [[Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race]] aboard his {{convert|52|ft|m|adj=on}} sailboat ''Lightning''. He subsequently sold the boat. He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on March 15, 2004. Fellow Detroiter [[Kid Rock]] gave the induction speech and Michigan Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]] proclaimed that date Bob Seger Day in his honor. In 2005, Seger was featured singing with [[3 Doors Down]] on the song \"[[Landing in London]]\" from their ''[[Seventeen Days]]'' album.\n\nBob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band were inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/85-bob-seger-a-the-silver-bullet-band|title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends - Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band|website=www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com}}</ref>\n\nSeger's first new album in eleven years, titled ''[[Face the Promise]]'', was released in 2006. In its first 45 days, it sold more than 400,000 copies.<ref>According to [[Soundscan]].</ref> The album sold over 1.2 million copies, returning Seger to platinum status and staying on the ''Billboard'' chart for several months. His supporting tour was also eagerly anticipated, with many shows selling out within minutes. Showing that Seger's legendary appeal in Michigan had not diminished, all 10,834 tickets available for his first show at Grand Rapids' [[Van Andel Arena]] sold out in under five minutes; three additional shows were subsequently added, each of which also sold out.\n\nIn 2009, Seger released a compilation album titled ''[[Early Seger Vol. 1]]'', which contained archival material from the 1970s and 1980s, including some fully or partially re-recorded tracks from his albums ''Smokin' O.P.'s'' (1972) and ''Seven'' (1974) and some never-before-released songs.<ref>{{cite news| last = Graff| first = Gary| title = New Seger Album Cover Revealed| publisher = [[WCSX]]| date = October 26, 2009| url = http://www.wcsx.com/news/Story.aspx?ID=1155281| access-date = October 31, 2009| author-link = Gary Graff| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110809233654/http://www.wcsx.com/news/Story.aspx?ID=1155281| archive-date = August 9, 2011| df = mdy-all}}</ref> The album was initially only available for purchase at [[Meijer]] stores and then later for download at BobSeger.com.<ref>{{cite web | title = Early Seger Vol. 1 |\npublisher\n = BobSeger.com | date = October 30, 2009 | url = http://bobseger.com/discography/index/album/albumId/22/tagName/Albums | access-date = October 31, 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100923113929/http://bobseger.com/discography/index/album/albumId/22/tagName/Albums | archive-date = September 23, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> Seger contributed piano and vocals on Kid Rock's 2010 album ''[[Born Free (Kid Rock album)|Born Free]]''.

Orbison's music is mostly in the [[rock music]] genre and his most successful periods were in the early 1960s and the late 1980s. He was nicknamed \"The [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] of Rock\" and \"The Big&nbsp;O\". Many of Orbison's songs conveyed vulnerability at a time when most male rock-and-roll performers projected [[machismo]]. He performed with minimal motion and in black clothes, matching his dyed black hair and dark [[sunglasses]].\n\nBorn in Texas, Orbison began singing in a [[Country music|country-and-western]] band as a teenager. He was signed by [[Sam Phillips]] of [[Sun Records]] in 1956 after \n[[Johnny Cash]] urged him to go to [[Sun Records|Sun]]. [[Elvis]] was leaving Sun and Phillips was looking to replace him. His first [[Sun]] recording, [[Ooby Dooby]] was a direct musical sound-a-like of Elvis's early Sun recordings. He had some success at [[Sun]] but enjoyed his greatest success with [[Monument Records]]. From 1960 to 1966, 22 of Orbison's singles reached the ''Billboard'' Top 40. He wrote or {{Nowrap|co-wrote}} almost all of his own Top 10 hits, including \"[[Only the Lonely]]\" (1960), \"[[Running Scared (Roy Orbison song)|Running Scared]]\" (1961), \"[[Crying (Roy Orbison song)|Crying]]\" (1961), \"[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison song)|In Dreams]]\" (1963), and \"[[Oh, Pretty Woman]]\" (1964).\n\nAfter the mid-1960s Orbison suffered a number of personal tragedies, and his career faltered. He experienced a resurgence in popularity in the 1980s, following the success of several cover versions of his songs. In 1988, he {{Nowrap|co-founded}} the [[Traveling Wilburys]] supergroup with [[George Harrison]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Tom Petty]], and [[Jeff Lynne]]. Orbison died of a heart attack that December at age 52. One month later, his song \"[[You Got It]]\" (1989) was released as a solo single, becoming his first hit to reach both the US and UK Top 10 in nearly 25 years.\n\nOrbison's honors include inductions into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1987, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1989, and the [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] in 2014. He received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and five other Grammy Awards. ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on its list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on its list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\". In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed him at number 74 on its list of the Top 600 recording artists.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\nOrbison was born on April 23, 1936, in [[Vernon, Texas]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Orbison |first=Roy Jr. |title=The Authorized Roy Orbison|publisher=Center Street|others=Wesley Orbison, Alex Orbison, Jeff Slate|date=2017|isbn=978-1-4789-7654-7|edition=first|location=New York|page=27|oclc=1017566749}}</ref> He was the second of three sons born to Orbie Lee Orbison (1913\u20131984) and Nadine Vesta Shults (1914\u20131992).

In West Texas, he was exposed to [[rhythm and blues]], [[western swing]], [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]], the orchestral arrangements of [[Mantovani]], and Cajun music.

One of these songs was ''Seems to Me'', by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant|Boudleaux Bryant]]. Bryant's impression of Orbison was of \"a timid, shy kid who seemed to be rather befuddled by the whole music scene.

The structure and themes of his songs defied convention, and his much-praised voice and performance style were unlike any other in rock and roll.{{according to whom|date=July 2021}} Many of his contemporaries compared his music with that of classically trained musicians, although he never mentioned any classical music influences. Peter Lehman summarized it, writing, \"He achieved what he did not by copying classical music but by creating a unique form of popular music that drew upon a wide variety of music popular during his youth.\"<ref>Lehman, p. 58.</ref> Orbison was known as \"the [[Enrico Caruso|Caruso]] [[Honorific nicknames in popular music#O|of Rock]]\"<ref name=\"Amburn\"/>{{refpage|p97}}<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hear-roy-orbison-croon-oh-pretty-woman-with-the-royal-philharmonic-125895/|title=Hear Roy Orbison Croon 'Oh, Pretty Woman' With the Royal Philharmonic|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=October 5, 2017}}</ref> and \"the Big O\".<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/>\n\nRoys Boys LLC, a Nashville-based company founded by Orbison's sons to administer their father's catalog and safeguard his legacy, announced a November 16, 2018, release of ''Unchained Melodies: Roy Orbison with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra'' album as well as an autumn 2018 Roy Orbison Hologram tour called ''In Dreams: Roy Orbison in Concert''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2018/10/roy-orbison-with-royal-philharmonic-unchained-melodies-releases-1116-includes-duet-with-country-musi.html|title=Roy Orbison with Royal Philharmonic \"Unchained Melodies\" Releases 11/16, Includes Duet With Country Music Sensation Cam|website=Music News Net}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}\n\n===Song structures===\nMusic critic [[Dave Marsh]] wrote that Orbison's compositions \"define a world unto themselves more completely than any other body of work in pop music\".<ref>Lehman, p. 20.</ref> Orbison's music, like the man himself, has been described as timeless, diverting from contemporary rock and roll and bordering on the eccentric, within a hair's breadth of being weird.<ref>Lehman, p. 9.</ref> Peter Watrous, writing for the ''New York Times'', declared in a concert review, \"He has perfected an odd vision of popular music, one in which eccentricity and imagination beat back all the pressures toward conformity\".<ref name=\"watrous\">Watrous, Peter (July 31, 1988). \"Roy Orbison Mines Some Old Gold\". ''The New York Times''. p. 48.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Orbison refused to splice edits of songs together and insisted on recording them in single takes with all the instruments and singers together.<ref>Lehman, p. 46.</ref> The only convention Orbison followed in his most popular songs is the time limit for radio fare in pop songs. Otherwise, each seems to follow a separate structure. Using the standard [[32-bar form]] for verses and choruses, normal pop songs followed the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus structure. Where A represents the verse, B represents the chorus, and C the bridge, most pop songs can be represented by A-B-A-B-C-A-B, like \"Ooby Dooby\" and \"Claudette\". Orbison's \"In Dreams\" was a song in seven movements that can be represented as Intro-A-B-C-D-E-F; no sections are repeated. In \"Running Scared\", however, the entire song repeats to build suspense to a final climax, to be represented as A-A-A-A-B. \"Crying\" is more complex, changing parts toward the end to be represented as A-B-C-D-E-F-A-B'-C'-D'-E'-F'.<ref>Lehman, p. 53.</ref> Although Orbison recorded and wrote standard structure songs before \"Only the Lonely\", he claimed never to have learned how to write them:<ref name=\"nswhof\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame |year=2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102144848/http://www.nashvillesongwritersfoundation.com/l-o/roy-orbison.aspx |archive-date=January 2, 2009 |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\n{{blockquote|I'm sure we had to study composition or something like that at school, and they'd say 'This is the way you do it,' and that's the way I would have done it, so being blessed again with not knowing what was wrong or what was right, I went on my own way.&nbsp;...

The Nashville session guitarist [[Jerry Kennedy]] stated, \"Roy went against the grain. The first time you'd hear something, it wouldn't sound right. But after a few playbacks, it would start to grow on you.\"<ref name=\"Amburn\"/>{{refpage|p128}}\n\n===Lyrical themes===\nCritic Dave Marsh categorizes Orbison's ballads into themes reflecting pain and loss, and dreaming. A third category is his uptempo rockabilly songs such as \"Go! Go! Go!\" and \"Mean Woman Blues\" that are more thematically simple, addressing his feelings and intentions in a masculine [[braggadocio (rap)|braggadocio]].{{citation needed|date=March 2024}} In concert, Orbison placed the uptempo songs between the ballads to keep from being too consistently dark or grim.<ref>Lehman, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Colin Escott wrote an introduction to Orbison's biography published in a CD box set: \"Orbison was the master of compression. Working the singles era, he could relate a short story, or establish a mood in under three minutes. If you think that's easy\u2014try it. His greatest recordings were quite simply perfect; not a word or note surplus to intention.\"<ref name=\"escott\"/> After attending a show in 1988, Peter Watrous of ''The New York Times'' wrote that Orbison's songs are \"dreamlike claustrophobically intimate set pieces\".<ref name=\"watrous\"/> Music critic Ken Emerson writes that the \"apocalyptic romanticism\" in Orbison's music was well-crafted for the films in which his songs appeared in the 1980s because the music was \"so over-the-top that dreams become delusions, and self-pity paranoia\", striking \"a post-modern nerve\".<ref>DeCurtis and Henke, p. 157.</ref> [[Led Zeppelin]] singer [[Robert Plant]] favored American R&B music as a youth, but beyond the black musicians, he named Elvis and Orbison especially as foreshadowing the emotions he would experience: \"The poignancy of the combination of lyric and voice was stunning. [Orbison] used drama to great effect and he wrote dramatically.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nThe loneliness in Orbison's songs that he became most famous for, he both explained and downplayed: \"I don't think I've been any more lonely than anyone else&nbsp;... Although if you grow up in West Texas, there are a lot of ways to be lonely.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> His music offered an alternative to the postured masculinity that was pervasive in music and culture. [[Robin Gibb]] of the [[Bee Gees]] stated, \"He made emotion fashionable, that it was all right to talk about and sing about very emotional things. For men to sing about very emotional things&nbsp;... Before that no one would do it.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/> Orbison acknowledged this in looking back on the era in which he became popular: \"When [\"Crying\"] came out I don't think anyone had accepted the fact that a man should cry when he wants to cry.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\n===Voice quality===\n{{Quote box\n | width = 30%\n | quote = What separates Orbison from so many other multi-octave-spanning power singers is that he can hit the biggest notes imaginable and still sound ''unspeakably sad'' at the same time.

[[Dwight Yoakam]] stated that Orbison's voice sounded like \"the cry of an angel falling backward through an open window\".<ref>Lehman, p. 22.</ref> [[Barry Gibb]] of [[The Bee Gees]] went further to say that when he heard \"Crying\" for the first time, \"That was it.

His voice could jar a corpse, always leave you muttering to yourself something like, \"Man, I don't believe it\". | Bob Dylan}}\n\nLikewise, Tim Goodwin, who conducted the orchestra that backed Orbison in Bulgaria, had been told that Orbison's voice would be a singular experience to hear. When Orbison started with \"Crying\" and hit the high notes, Goodwin stated: \"The strings were playing and the band had built up and, sure enough, the hair on the back of my neck just all started standing up.

During the first few songs in a concert, the [[vibrato]] in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable.<ref name=\"Lehman, p. 24\">Lehman, p. 24.</ref> This also happened with age.

Being that he was so grounded and so strong and so gentle and quiet. He was just there.\"<ref name=\"hall\"/>\n\nOrbison attributed his own passion during his performances to the period when he grew up in Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant; his father brought out a guitar in the evenings playing the driving rhythm of western swing, and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military gathered to drink and sing heartily with him. Orbison later reflected, \"I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do it now and do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time.\"<ref name=\"Amburn\"/>{{refpage|p7}}\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Roy Orbison discography}}\n'''Studio albums'''\n*''[[Lonely and Blue]]'' (1961)\n*''[[Roy Orbison at the Rock House]]'' (1961)\n*''[[Crying (album)|Crying]]'' (1962)\n*''[[In Dreams (Roy Orbison album)|In Dreams]]'' (1963)\n*''Oh, Pretty Woman'' (non-US) (1964)\n*''[[There Is Only One Roy Orbison]]'' (1965)\n*''[[Orbisongs]]'' (1965)\n*''[[The Orbison Way]]'' (1966)\n*''[[The Classic Roy Orbison]]'' (1966)\n*''[[Roy Orbison Sings Don Gibson]]''/''Sweet Dreams'' (Africa) (1967)\n*''[[Cry Softly Lonely One]]'' (1967)\n*''[[Roy Orbison's Many Moods]]'' (1969)\n*''[[Hank Williams the Roy Orbison Way]]'' (1970)\n*''[[The Big O (album)|The Big O]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Roy Orbison Sings]]'' (1972)\n*''[[Memphis (Roy Orbison album)|Memphis]]'' (1972)\n*''[[Milestones (Roy Orbison album)|Milestones]]'' (1973)\n*''[[I'm Still in Love with You (Roy Orbison album)|I'm Still in Love with You]]'' (1975)\n*''[[Regeneration (Roy Orbison album)|Regeneration]]'' (1976)\n*''[[Laminar Flow (album)|Laminar Flow]]'' (1979)\n*''[[Class of '55: Memphis Rock & Roll Homecoming]]'' (with [[Johnny Cash]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], and [[Carl Perkins]]) (1986)\n*''[[In Dreams: The Greatest Hits]]'' (1987)\n\n'''Posthumous albums'''\n*''[[Mystery Girl]]'' (1989)\n*''[[King of Hearts (Roy Orbison album)|King of Hearts]]'' (1992)\n*''[[The Last Concert (Roy Orbison album)|The Last Concert]]'' (2009)\n*''[[One of the Lonely Ones]]'' (2015)\n\n'''Remix albums'''\n*''[[A Love So Beautiful (album)|A Love So Beautiful]]'' (with [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra|The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]) (2017)\n*''Unchained Melodies'' (with The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra) (2018)\n\n'''Concert videos'''\n* 1972: ''[[Live from Australia (Roy Orbison album)]]''\n* 1982: ''[[Live at Austin City Limits]]''\n* 1988: ''[[Roy Orbison and Friends: A Black and White Night]]''\n\n==Honors==\n''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed him at number 37 on their list of the \"Greatest Artists of All Time\" and number 13 on their list of the \"100 Greatest Singers of All Time'.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231 |title=100 Greatest Singers of All Time |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=November 27, 2008 |via=Rolling Stone website |access-date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> In 2002, ''Billboard'' magazine listed Orbison at number 74 in the Top 600 recording artists.{{sfnp|Whitburn|2004|p=524}}\n\n* '''Grammy Awards'''<ref name=\"grammy\"/>\n** Best Country Performance Duo or Group (1980) (\"That Lovin' You Feelin' Again\", with Emmylou Harris)\n** Best Spoken Word or Non-Musical Recording (1986) (\"Interviews From The Class Of '55 Recording Sessions\", with Johnny Cash, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Sam Phillips, Rick Nelson and Chips Moman)\n** Best Country Vocal Collaboration (1988) (\"Crying\", with k.d. lang)\n** Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (1989) (''Traveling Wilburys Volume One'', as a member of the Traveling Wilburys)\n** Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male (1990) (\"Oh, Pretty Woman\")\n** Lifetime Achievement Award (1998)\n* [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] (1987)<ref name=\"rockhall\"/>\n* [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1987)<ref name=\"nswhof\"/>\n* [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (1989)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C173 |title=Roy Orbison |publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame |access-date=May 30, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130041222/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C173 |archive-date=January 30, 2009}}</ref>\n* Star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (2010)<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8488965.stm Roy Orbison given Hollywood Walk of Fame star] BBC News (January 30, 2010).
