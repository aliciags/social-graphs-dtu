Siblings included brothers Jay and Clayton.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 8\u20139.]]</ref> The boys grew up hearing [[Southern gospel]] music sung by white friends in church and by black field workers and sharecroppers in the cotton fields.<ref name=pc8>{{Pop Chronicles|8|3}}</ref> On Saturday nights Perkins would listen to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', broadcast from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on his father's radio.\n\n[[Roy Acuff]]'s broadcasts from the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor.]]</ref> Since they could not afford to buy one, his father made one from a [[cigar box guitar|cigar box]] and a broomstick. Eventually, a neighbor sold his father a worn-out [[Gene Autry]] guitar. Perkins could not afford new strings, and when they broke, he had to retie them. The knots cut his fingers when he would slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of [[blue note]].<ref name=\"naylor118\" /><ref name=\":0\">[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 13\u201314.]]</ref>\n\nPerkins taught himself parts of Acuff's \"[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|Great Speckled Bird]]\" and \"[[The Wabash Cannonball]]\", having heard them played on the ''Opry''. He also has cited [[Bill Monroe]]'s fast playing and vocals as an early influence.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 11\u201312.]]</ref> Perkins also learned from John Westbrook, an African-American field worker in his sixties who played blues and gospel music on an old acoustic guitar. Westbrook advised Perkins to \"Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate.\"<ref name=\"naylor118\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn January 1947, the Perkins family moved from [[Lake County, Tennessee]], to [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]], 70 miles from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the largest city in West Tennessee and a center of a great variety of music played by both black and white artists.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 55.]]</ref> At age fourteen Perkins wrote a country song called \"Let Me Take You to the Movie, Magg\". [[Sam Phillips]] was later persuaded by the quality of that song to sign Perkins to his [[Sun Records]] label.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 68.]]</ref>\n\n===Beginnings as a performer===\nPerkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainers during late 1946 at the Cotton Boll tavern on Highway 45, twelve miles south of Jackson, Tennessee, starting on Wednesday nights. Perkins was 14 years old. One of the songs they played was an up-tempo country blues shuffle version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\". Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a tavern, and Perkins drank four beers that first night. Within a month Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch tavern, near the western boundary of Jackson. Both places were the scene of occasional fights, and both of the Perkins brothers gained a reputation as fighters.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 36\u201341.]]</ref>\n\nDuring the next couple of years, as they became better known, the Perkins brothers began playing other taverns around Bemis and Jackson, including El Rancho, the Roadside Inn, and the Hilltop. Carl persuaded his brother Clayton to join them and play the [[upright bass]], to complete the sound of the band.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 48.]]</ref>\n\nPerkins began performing regularly on [[WTJF (AM)|WTJS]] in Jackson during the late 1940s as a sometime member of the [[Tennessee Ramblers (Tennessee band)|Tennessee Ramblers]]. He appeared on the radio program ''Hayloft Frolic'', on which he performed two songs. Sometimes one was \"Talking Blues\", as done by Robert Lunn on the ''Grand Ole Opry''. Perkins and his brothers began appearing on ''The Early Morning Farm and Home Hour''. Positive listener response resulted in a 15-minute segment sponsored by Mother's Best Flour. By the end of the 1940s, the Perkins Brothers were the best-known band in the Jackson area.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 48\u201349.]]</ref> Perkins had day jobs during most of these early years, including picking cotton, working at various factories and plants, and as a pan greaser for the Colonial Baking Company.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 32, 70\u201371.]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockabillytennessee.com/legend_carl_perkins.htm |title=The Legend Carl Perkins |publisher=Rockabillytennessee.com |date=1998-01-19 |access-date=2011-11-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117221958/http://www.rockabillytennessee.com/legend_carl_perkins.htm |archive-date=November 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His brothers had similar pick-up jobs.\n\nIn January 1953, Perkins married Valda Crider, whom he had known for a number of years. When his job at the bakery was reduced to part-time, Valda, who had her own job, encouraged Perkins to begin working the taverns full-time. He began playing six nights a week. Later the same year he added [[W. S. Holland|W.S. \"Fluke\" Holland]] to the band as a drummer. Holland had no previous experience as a musician but had a good sense of rhythm.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 70\u201371.]]</ref>\n\n[[Malcolm Yelvington]], who remembered the Perkins Brothers when they played in [[Covington, Tennessee]], in 1953, noted that Carl had an unusual blues-like style all his own.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 77.]]</ref> By 1955 Perkins had made tapes of his material with a borrowed tape recorder, and he sent them to companies such as Columbia and RCA. But he used addresses such as \"Columbia Records, New York City\" and seemed dismayed at the lack of response. \"I had sent tapes to RCA and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and had never heard a thing from 'em.\"<ref name=\"Top Beats Bottom\"/>\n\nIn July 1954, Perkins and his wife heard a new release of \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\" by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] on the radio.<ref>[http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/pics/d03/3318.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> As the song faded out, Perkins said, \"There's a man in Memphis who understands what we're doing.

Berry assured him that they had remained much more popular in Britain since the 1950s than they had in the United States, and that there would be large crowds of fans at every show. The popular young rock group [[The Animals]] backed the two performers. On the last night of the tour, Perkins attended a party where he sat on the floor sharing stories, playing guitar, and singing songs while surrounded by the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]. Ringo Starr asked if he could record \"Honey Don't\". Perkins answered, \"Man, go ahead, have at it.\"<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 142.]]</ref> The Beatles later recorded covers of \"[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]\", \"[[Honey Don't]]\" and \"[[Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby]]\" (recorded by Perkins, adapted from a song originally recorded by [[Rex Griffin]] in 1936, with new music by Perkins; a song with the same title was recorded by Roy Newman in 1938).

That same year [[Bob Luman]] had a Top 40 Country hit with Carl's song \"Poor Boy Blues\".\n\nWhile on tour with the Johnny Cash troupe in 1968, Perkins went on a four-day drinking binge that ended in him hallucinating floridly and passing out. When he regained consciousness, he went out to the beach with his last bottle of alcohol. In his autobiography, he described falling to his knees and declaring, \"Lord,&nbsp;... I'm gonna throw this bottle. I'm gonna show You that I believe in you,\" before hurling the bottle into the sea and vowing to remain sober. Perkins and Cash, who had his own substance-abuse issues, supported each other in their bid to remain sober.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 309\u2013310.]]</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Cash recorded the Perkins-written \"[[Daddy Sang Bass]]\" (which incorporates parts of the American standard \"[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (Bye and Bye)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]\"), and scored No. 1 on the country music charts for six weeks. \"Daddy Sang Bass\" was a [[Country Music Association]] nominee for Song of the Year. Perkins also played lead guitar on Cash's single \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\", recorded live at [[San Quentin]] prison, which went to No. 1 for five weeks on the country chart and No. 2 on the pop chart (the performance was also filmed by [[Granada Television]] for broadcast).\n\nPerkins spent a decade in Cash's touring revue, often as an opening act for Cash (as at the Folsom and San Quentin prison concerts, at which he was recorded singing \"Blue Suede Shoes\" and \"Matchbox\" before Cash took the stage; these performances were not released until the 2000s). He also appeared on the television series ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]''. On the television program ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' on April 16, 1969, hosted by Cash, Perkins performed his song \"[[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|Restless]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/lyrics3/r0051.htm |title=Restless - Carl Perkins |publisher=Rockabillyeurope.com |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929222820/http://www.rockabillyeurope.com/lyrics3/r0051.htm |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tv.com/kraft-music-hall/johnny-cash...on-the-road/episode/170681/summary.html |title=Kraft Music Hall: Johnny Cash&nbsp;...

The show was taped live at the [[Limehouse Studios]]. It was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] on January 1, 1986. Perkins performed 16 songs, with two encores, in an extraordinary performance. He and his friends ended the session by singing \"Blue Suede Shoes\", his most famous song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears. The concert special was a highlight of his later career. It has been praised by fans for the spirited performances delivered by Perkins and his guests.

In 1996 [[Willie Nelson]], who also appeared in that movie, would join Carl in a duett version of the song. During the production of this album, Perkins was diagnosed with [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]]. \nDolly Parton had a Top 20 Country hit in 1991 with the Perkins co-written [[Silver and Gold (Dolly Parton song)|\"Silver and Gold\"]].\n\n[[Mark O'Connor]] recorded a version of the Perkins classic [[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|\"Restless\"]] in 1991 and had a #25 Country hit with it in the US (#19 in Canada).\n\nHe again returned to Sun Studio to record with Scotty Moore, Presley's first guitar player, for the album ''706 ReUNION'', released by Belle Meade Records, which also featured [[D.

Felts enjoyed modest pop success in 1960 with a remake of the Drifters' \"Honey Love\",<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which earned a low position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. He went on to release such songs as \"Lonely Teardrops\" and \"Pink And Black Days\", but he did not begin enjoying success on a national level as a country singer until the 1970s.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> His first major hit came in 1973, with a cover of Dobie Gray's \"[[Drift Away]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Felts' version \u2013 number eight on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in September 1973 \u2013 was midtempo country compared to Gray's blues version. The follow-up single, \"All in the Name of Love\", just missed hitting the top 10 in December 1973.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nFelts continued to enjoy modest success during the next year and a half, when he signed with [[ABC Records|ABC-Dot Records]] in 1975.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> That year, he enjoyed his biggest hit, a cover of [[Johnny Adams]]' soul classic \"Reconsider Me\",<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which showcased his falsetto and high tenor. The song reached number two that August, and was 1975's second-biggest country hit of the year.<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1975 |title=Billboard.com - Year End Charts - Year-end Singles - Hot Country Songs |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=April 21, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211063352/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/yearend_chart_display.jsp?f=Hot+Country+Songs&g=Year-end+Singles&year=1975 |archive-date=December 11, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFelts, who became known to fans as \"Narvel the Marvel\", continued to enjoy success throughout the 1970s. Included in his streak of hits was a remake of \"[[Lonely Teardrops]]\", which became his last top-10 hit in the summer of 1976, and a cover of [[Willie Nelson]]'s \"[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He also had a number-14 country hit with \"[[Everlasting Love]]\" in 1979.\n\nNarvel Felts' pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Personal life==\nHe is married to the former Loretta Stanfield. \n\nTwo children resulted from their marriage, although they lost their only son at the age of 31, Albert Narvel Jr. (known as Bub), on September 14, 1995, as the result of an automobile accident.

Reed's grandparents lived in [[Rockmart, Georgia|Rockmart]] and he would visit them from time to time. As a small child running around strumming his guitar he is quoted as saying \"I am gonna be a star. I'm gonna go to [[Nashville]] and be a star.\" Reed's parents separated four months after his birth; he and his sister spent seven years in [[foster home]]s or [[orphanage]]s growing up. Reed was reunited with his mother and stepfather in 1944.\n\nReed graduated from O'Keefe High School, an Atlanta city school. The O'Keefe building still exists today; it was sold to [[Georgia Tech]] and is now part of the university's campus. By high school, Reed was already writing and singing music, having learned to play the guitar as a child. At age 18, he was signed by publisher and record producer [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] to cut his first record, \"[[If the Good Lord's Willing and the Creek Don't Rise]]\".\n\nAt [[Capitol Records]] Reed was promoted as a new \"teen-age sensation\" after recording his own [[rockabilly]] composition \"When I Found You\" in 1956. He recorded both country and rockabilly singles and found success as a songwriter when label mate [[Gene Vincent]] covered his song \"Crazy Legs\" in 1958.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nBy 1958, [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] signed Reed to his company, [[National Recording Corporation]]. He recorded for NRC as both an artist and as a member of the staff band which included [[Joe South]] and [[Ray Stevens]], other NRC artists.\n\nReed married [[Priscilla Mitchell|Priscilla \"Prissy\" Mitchell]] in 1959. They had two daughters, Seidina Ann Hubbard, born April 2, 1960, and Charlotte Elaine (Lottie) Zavala, born October 19, 1970. Mitchell was a member of folk group The Appalachians (\"Bony Moronie\", 1963), and with [[Roy Drusky]] was co-credited on the 1965 country No. 1 \"[[Yes, Mr. Peters]]\".\n\n==Career==\nIn 1959, Reed hit the Billboard \"Bubbling Under the Top 100\", also known as the Roar and Cashbox Country chart with the single \"Soldier's Joy\". After serving two years in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], Reed moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1961 to continue his songwriting career, which had continued to gather steam while he was in the Army, thanks to [[Brenda Lee]]'s 1960 cover of his song \"That's All You Got to Do\".<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> He also became a popular session and tour guitarist.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> In 1962, he scored some success with two singles \"[[Goodnight Irene]]\" (as by Jerry Reed & the Hully Girlies, featuring a female vocal group) and \"Hully Gully Guitar\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> which found their way to [[Chet Atkins]] at [[RCA Victor]], who produced Reed's 1965 \"If I Don't Live Up to It\".\n\n===\"Guitar Man\"===\nIn July 1967, Reed had his best showing on the country chart (No. 53) with his self-penned \"[[Guitar Man (Jerry Reed song)|Guitar Man]]\", which [[Elvis Presley]] soon covered.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Reed's next single was \"Tupelo Mississippi Flash\", a comic tribute to Presley. Recorded on September 1, the song became his first [[Top 20]] hit, going to No. 15 on the chart. Coincidentally Presley came to Nashville to record nine days later on September 10, 1967, and one of the songs he became especially excited about was \"Guitar Man\".\n\nReed recalled how he was tracked down to play on the Presley session: \"I was out on the [[Cumberland River]] fishing, and I got a call from [[Felton Jarvis]] (then Presley's producer at [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]) He said, 'Elvis is down here. We've been trying to cut \"Guitar Man\" all day long. He wants it to sound like it sounded on your album.' I finally told him, 'Well, if you want it to sound like that, you're going have to get me in there to play guitar, because these guys [you're using in the studio] are [[Flatpicking|straight pickers]]. I [[fingerpicking|pick with my fingers]] and tune that guitar up all weird kind of ways.'\"<ref name=\"tennessean\">{{cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080902/TUNEIN/80902039|title='Bandit' star Reed dies at 71|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|date=September 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nJarvis hired Reed to play on the session. \"I hit that intro, and [Elvis's] face lit up and here we went. Then after he got through that, he cut [my] \"[[U.S. Male]]\" at the same session. I was toppin' cotton, son.\" Reed also played the guitar for Elvis Presley's [[Big Boss Man (song)|\"Big Boss Man\"]] (1967), recorded in the same session.<ref>Ernst Jorgensen, ''Elvis Presley: A Life in Music'' (St. Martin's Press, 1998), pp. 234\u2013236</ref>\n\nOn January 15 and 16, 1968, Reed worked on a second Presley session, during which he played guitar on a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Too Much Monkey Business]]\", \"Stay Away\", and \"Goin' Home\" (two songs revolving around Presley's film ''[[Stay Away, Joe]]''), as well as another Reed composition, \"U.S. Male\" (Reed's quoted recollection of \"U.S. Male\" being recorded at the same session as \"Guitar Man\" being incorrect).<ref>Jorgensen, pp. 241\u2013242</ref>\n\nPresley also recorded two other Reed compositions: \"[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]\" in May 1971 for his [[He Touched Me (Elvis Presley album)|''He Touched Me'']] album, and \"Talk About The Good Times\" in December 1973, for a total of four.\n\n[[Johnny Cash]] also released \"[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]\" as a single in 1971.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> It  reached No. 2 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Country Singles Chart for North America and was also successful in Europe. It became the title track for a studio [[A Thing Called Love|album]] that he released the following spring.\n\n===1970s===\nAfter releasing the 1970 crossover hit \"[[Amos Moses]]\", a hybrid of rock, country, funk, and Cajun styles which reached No. 8 on the U.S. pop chart,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Reed teamed with Atkins for the duet LP ''[[Me & Jerry]]'', which earned the pair the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]]. During the 1970 television season, he was a regular on ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', and in 1971 he released his biggest hit, the chart-topper \"[[When You're Hot, You're Hot]]\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>KO buddy of the singer, who nevertheless sends him up the river for gambling. Aside from being a major crossover hit, \"When You're Hot, You're Hot\" earned Reed the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male]].\n\n\"When You're Hot, You're Hot\" was the title track of Reed's first solo album, reaching No. 9 Pop and No. 6 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart.

A year later he scored his second number one single with \"Lord, Mr. Ford\" (written by [[Deena Kaye Rose]]), from the album of the same name.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nAtkins, who frequently produced Reed's music, remarked that he had to encourage Reed to put instrumental numbers on his own albums, as Reed always considered himself more of a songwriter than a player. Atkins, however, thought Reed was a better [[fingerstyle]] player than he was himself; Reed, according to Atkins, helped him work out the fingerpicking for one of Atkins's biggest hits, \"[[Yakety Sax]]\".\n\nReed was featured in animated form in a December 9, 1972, episode of [[Hanna\u2013Barbera]]'s ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', \"The Phantom of the Country Music Hall\" (prod. No. 61-10). He sang and played the song \"Pretty Mary Sunlight\". The song is played throughout the episode as Scooby and the gang search for Reed's missing guitar.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Reed's recording career began to take a back seat to his acting aspirations.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> In 1974, he co-starred with his close friend [[Burt Reynolds]] in the film ''[[W.W. and the Dixie Dancekings]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> While he continued to record throughout the decade, his greatest visibility was as a motion picture star and almost always in tandem with headliner Reynolds; after 1976's ''[[Gator (film)|Gator]]'',<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Reed appeared in 1978's ''[[High-Ballin']]'' and 1979's ''[[Hot Stuff (1979 film)|Hot Stuff]]''. He also co-starred in all three of the ''[[Smokey and the Bandit (franchise)|Smokey and the Bandit]]'' films; the [[Smokey and the Bandit|first]], which premiered in 1977, landed Reed a No. 2 hit with the soundtrack's \"East Bound and Down\".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tassler |first=Mark|date=2016-08-25 |title=Story Behind the Song: 'Eastbound and Down' by Jerry Reed |url=https://kxrb.com/story-behind-the-song-eastbound-and-down-by-jerry-reed/ |access-date=2023-10-14 |website=KXRB 1140 AM/100.1 FM |language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, Reed joined entrepreneur [[Larry Schmittou]] and other country music stars including [[Conway Twitty]], [[Cal Smith]], [[Larry Gatlin]], and [[Richard Sterban]], as investors in the [[Nashville Sounds]], a [[minor league baseball]] team of the [[Double-A (baseball)|Double-A]] [[Southern League (1964\u20132020)|Southern League]] that began play in 1978.<ref>{{citation|first=Larry|last=Woody|title=Schmittou: A Grand Slam in Baseball, Business, And Life|publisher=Eggmann Publishing Company|location=Nashville|year=1996|isbn=1886371334|pages=64\u201365}}</ref>\n\nHe made two guest appearances on the sitcom ''[[Alice (American TV series)|Alice]]'', in 1978 and 1981.\n\nReed also took a stab at hosting a TV variety show, filming two episodes of ''The Jerry Reed Show'' in 1976.\n\nScottish rockers [[The Sensational Alex Harvey Band]] released a version of \"Amos Moses\" in 1976.\n\nIn 1979, he released a record comprising both vocal and instrumental selections titled, appropriately enough, ''Half & Half''. It was followed one year later by ''Jerry Reed Sings [[Jim Croce]]'', a tribute to the late singer/songwriter. He also starred in a TV movie in that year entitled ''[[Concrete Cowboys (1979 film)|Concrete Cowboys]]''.\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nIn January 1980, Reed began work on the \"Guitar Man\" re-recording being produced by Presley's producer Felton Jarvis. With a new \"hopped up\" guitar line and Presley on lead vocals, the song reached number one on the country chart.\n\nIn 1982, Reed's career as a singles artist was revitalized by the chart-topping hit \"[[She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)]]\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> followed by \"[[The Bird (Jerry Reed song)|The Bird]]\", which peaked at No. 2.

In the same year he co-starred with [[Robin Williams]] and [[Walter Matthau]] in the [[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] comedy ''[[The Survivors (1983 film)|The Survivors]]''. Reed guest-starred in the October 13, 1983, episode of ''[[Mama's Family]]'', \"The Return of Leonard Oates\" (Episode 13, Season 2), as Naomi Harper's ex-husband.\n\nHe accepted an invitation to open for the British group [[Dexys Midnight Runners]] in the US in 1984, yet left the tour early to appear on the country music comedy TV show ''[[Hee-Haw]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/04/usa |title=Jerry Reed |first=Garth |last=Cartwright |date=September 3, 2008 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\nAfter an unsuccessful 1986 LP, ''Lookin' at You'', Reed focused on touring until 1992 when he and Atkins reunited for the album ''[[Sneakin' Around]]'' before he again returned to the road. In the meantime, Reed appeared in several interviews and commercial spots for [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Mid-South Wrestling]].\n\nReed had a role as a commander/Huey pilot for [[Danny Glover]]'s character in the 1988 movie ''[[Bat*21]]'' starring [[Gene Hackman]]. He also acted as executive producer and screenwriter on this film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/bat-21-film |title=The Most Trusted Place for Answering Life's Questions |publisher=Answers |access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref>\n\nReed starred in the 1998 [[Adam Sandler]] film ''[[The Waterboy]]'' as Red Beaulieu, the movie's chief antagonist and the head coach for the University of Louisiana Cougars football team. Actor [[Henry Winkler]] recounts that Reed taught him how to bass fish while on location for this movie.<ref> https://x.com/hwinkler4real/status/1774928469346169097 </ref>\n\nHe teamed up with country superstars [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Mel Tillis]], and [[Bobby Bare]] in the group [[Old Dogs (group)|Old Dogs]]. They recorded one album in 1998, entitled ''[[Old Dogs (album)|Old Dogs]]'', with songs written by [[Shel Silverstein]]. Reed sang lead on \"Young Man's Job\" and \"Elvis Has Left The Building\", the latter possibly in deference to Elvis helping launch his career.\n\nIn 1998, the American rock band [[Primus (band)|Primus]] covered the Reed song \"Amos Moses\" on the EP titled ''[[Rhinoplasty (album)|Rhinoplasty]]''.\n\n===2000s===\nIn October 2004, \"Amos Moses\" was featured on the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas#Soundtrack|Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' soundtrack which played on the fictional radio station [[K-Rose]]. In 2007, the British band [[Alabama 3]] (known as A3 in the U.S.) covered his hit \"Amos Moses\" on their album, ''[[M.O.R. (album)|M.O.R.]]''\n\nIn June 2005, American guitarist [[Eric Johnson (guitarist, born 1954)|Eric Johnson]] released his album ''[[Bloom (Eric Johnson album)|Bloom]]'' which contained a track titled \"Tribute to Jerry Reed\" in commemoration of his works.\n\nReed appeared as a guest on the fishing television series ''[[Bill Dance Outdoors]]''. In one memorable appearance, Reed caught a particularly big [[largemouth bass]] and planned to have it preserved and mounted by a [[taxidermist]]. Host [[Bill Dance (television host)|Bill Dance]] objected to this plan and freed the fish when Reed was not looking. Reed became enraged when he discovered what had happened and chased Dance off the boat and to shore. This incident was mentioned in one of [[Jeff Foxworthy]]'s stand-up comedy routines.\n\n\"She Got the Goldmine (I Got the Shaft)\" was used in the 2010 film, ''[[The Bounty Hunter (2010 film)|The Bounty Hunter]]''. It plays during the scene where Milo ([[Gerard Butler]]) searches Nicole's ([[Jennifer Aniston]]) apartment.\n\n\"[[You Took All the Ramblin' Out of Me]]\" was used in the 2013 video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', on the radio station [[Grand Theft Auto V soundtrack#Rebel Radio|Rebel Radio]].\n\n\"Talk About the Good Times\" was used as the opening theme for the 2022 streaming TV series ''[[Sprung (TV series)|Sprung]]'' in all but the first episode.

His piano contributed to the single \"Let's Have A Party\", which was released in 1960. The song reached No. 32 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and made the Top 40 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\nDowning reached the U.S. Hot 100 with \"You\u2019ll Never Miss the Water (Till the Well Runs Dry)\", a duet with [[Little Esther Phillips]]. After the release of this single, he was signed by [[Warner Brothers]]. In 1974, Downing recorded the single, \"[[I'll Be Holding On]]\", which went to number one on the U.S. [[Disco]] chart for three weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974\u20132003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=83}}</ref> In addition, \"I'll Be Holding On\" was a hit in Europe.  On the other US charts, the single went to No. 31 on the soul chart and No. 85 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942\u20132004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=170}}</ref>\n\n===Country music with Warner Brothers===\nAl Downing's popularity continued to grow, and he had several hits on the country charts between 1978 and 1989. He compiled a list of his own songs, which he presented to his producer at Warner Brothers. In 1978, \"Mr. Jones\" reached the Top 20, followed by \"Touch Me (I'll Be Your Fool Once More)\" in 1979. That same year, Downing produced \"Midnight Lace,\" which reached the 50s on the charts, and \"I Ain't No Fool,\" which peaked at the upper 70s. In 1980, the \"Story Behind The Story\" reached the Top 40 and \"Bring It On Home\" reached the Top 20.\n\nTwo years passed before Downing created another hit, this time with the Team label. In 1982, \"I'll Be Loving You\" reached the Top 50, followed by \"Darlene,\" which reached the lower 60s. The next year, \"It Takes Love\" reached the Top 40, followed by \"Let's Sing About Love,\" which peaked in the mid-60s. In 1984, \"The Best Of Families\" became a Top 50 hit; That same year, Downing released his final hit with the Team label, \"There\u2019ll Never Be A Better Night For Being Wrong\".\n\n===Vine Street years===\nIn 1987, Downing was signed by the [[Vine Street]] label, which released the \"Oh How Beautiful You Are\" (To Me) and \"Just One Night Won't Do,\" both of which hit the Top 70. Two years later, he was signed by Door Knob Records, with whom he produced the 1989 Top 100 hit, \"I Guess By Now.\"\n\nThe popular entertainer [[Fats Domino]] recorded two songs written by Downing: \"Mary, Oh Mary\" and \"Heartbreak Hill\". [[Bobby Bland|Bobby \"Blue\" Bland]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] have also recorded Downing's songs.\n\n===Later career===\nDowning built a five-decade career around his powerful singing voice and his hard-driving rockabilly-style piano. Downing's compilations of earlier work have been released throughout the world. In Europe, Crazy Music obtained exclusive rights for the original Team label recordings and released these in the form of a 2-CD compilation, ''Classic Collection''. This also contained some of Downing's earlier hits, including \"Mr. Jones.\"\n\nIn July 2002, he played the Oneida Casino's Rock'n'Roll Festival in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] with dozens of other rockabilly musicians.\n\nIn 2003, Downing released his first new album in more than a decade, ''One of A Kind''. The album received favourable radio and print reviews. It ranked third on ''American Roots Country'' and was commended for featuring 14 memorable tracks. He continued to give regular performances at the Grand Ole Opry. In 2000, he was nominated as a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.\n\nDowning continued to perform on more than 75 occasions per year in the remaining years of his life. He appeared at [[Ontario]]'s [[Havelock Country Jamboree]] with [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Roy Clark]]. In 2005, Downing postponed plans for a European tour that was set to begin on July 1 in Austria. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic [[leukemia]]. Soon after, he commenced [[chemotherapy]] treatment. Downing died on July 4, 2005.\n\n==Style==\nDowning's musical style found its roots in a variety of musical styles including [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], roots, [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[country music|country]]. He performed [[rhythm and blues]] and [[disco]] throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when he lived in [[Washington, D.C.]]  He eventually reclaimed his musical roots by turning to country music.\n\n== Producer ==\nIn additional to his work as a recording artist and performer, Downing also worked as a music producer. During late 1990s and early 2000s, he worked with several European musicians as an [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) agent. In 2003, he produced the album, ''Straight Beat'', with the Italian bluesman Edo 'Ndoss, which included songs written by Downing that he had not recorded himself. Downing's piano work on this album represented his last recording.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Album\n! <small>[[Top Country Albums|US Country]]</small>\n!

She was one of the few women working in the male-dominated rock and roll music field during the 1950s and one of country music's early female innovators. Martin was nicknamed the Female Elvis for her dance moves on stage, similar to those of [[Elvis Presley]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{More citations needed |date=June 2018}}\n\n===Early life and rise to fame===\nMartin was born in [[Sutherlin, Virginia]], east of [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]]. Her mother was a stage mother, and her father and uncle were both musicians. Before she was six, Martin was already singing and playing the guitar, inspired by [[Eddy Arnold]] and [[Hank Williams]]. \nOver the years, this resulted in statewide contests with over 200 contestants, which she won. As a result, Janis was asked to play on the same bill as [[Cowboy Copas]] and [[Sunshine Sue]].  Through them Martin became a member of the [[Old Dominion Barn Dance|Old Dominion Barndance]] on [[WRVA (AM)|WRVA]], which came out of Richmond every Saturday Night on CBS network. When she was in her mid-teens, she was appearing with country singers including Arnold, [[Hank Snow]], [[The Browns]] and [[Jim Reeves]].  She soon claimed she was tired of country music and began a rock and roll career.\n\n===Teen rock and roll star===\nThe WRVA station announcer, Carl Stutz, wrote a song titled \"Will You Willyum\", and asked Martin to sing the song live on stage that Saturday night so that he could make a demo tape to send to his publisher in New York. A week later, Stutz called Martin to tell her that [[RCA Victor]] was interested in recording \"Will You Willyum\". As it happened, the publisher offered \"Will You Willyum\" to [[Steve Sholes]], a producer at RCA Victor, and asked whether Sholes had an artist to record it. Apparently Sholes replied \"Well, who's the girl doin' the demo?\"\n\nAt age 15, Martin signed with RCA Victor in March 1956, just two months after Elvis Presley joined the label. She recorded \"Will You Willyum\" on March 8, 1956, backed by her own composition \"Drugstore Rock 'n Roll\".\n\nThe song became the biggest hit of her career, selling 750,000 records. Soon Martin was performing on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen]]''. She also appeared on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Jubilee USA]]'', and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in Nashville, Tennessee, becoming one of the younger performers to ever appear. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her Most Promising Female Vocalist that year.\n\nPresley and RCA were so impressed with Martin's stage presence that they dubbed her the Female Elvis.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=April 7, 1956 |title=Review spotlight on... |pages=44 |magazine=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZB8EAAAAMBAJ&dq=janis+martin+female+elvis&pg=PA44 |access-date=March 29, 2022}}</ref><ref>[[Sun Records]] also dubbed [[Jean Chapel]] the female Elvis Presley in 1956 when she began recording rockabilly songs including \"I Won't Be Rocking Tonight\".</ref> Presley sent a dozen red roses to her when she appeared at the RCA Victor convention in [[Miami, Florida]]. [[Colonel Tom Parker]], Elvis' manager, offered to take over her management seeing the potential of a successful double \"boy-girl\" bill. Just before, due to his extremely taxing touring schedule, Elvis had collapsed on stage in New York due to exhaustion. Safeguarding the young Janis Martin from this, her parents decided to not accept Parker's offer, and instead go with the head of the Old Dominion shows. RCA chose Martin to tour as a member of the [[Jim Reeves]] show and continued recording rock and roll and country material that ended up being successful on both charts, including \"My Boy Elvis\", \"Let's Elope Baby\", her cover of [[Roy Orbison]]'s song \"[[Ooby Dooby]]\", and \"[[Love Me to Pieces]]\".\n\nOn January 7, 1956, Martin eloped with her boyfriend, a paratrooper. She told her parents of her marriage only after her husband was safely shipped overseas in Germany. Her father tried to have it annulled because she was only 15 years old. Eventually, the matter was left, but Janis' mother ordered her to keep her marriage a secret to safeguard her career. In 1957, Janis went on a [[USO]] tour in Europe with [[Jim Reeves]], [[Del Wood]] (a pianist famous for performing the song \"Down Yonder\"), [[The Browns]], and [[Hank Locklin]]. Her husband got a 30-day leave and went on the road with her, which resulted in her getting pregnant with her son. Martin's teenage pregnancy caused RCA Victor to drop her in 1958. It was probably during this period that a 10\" LP album titled ''Janis and Elvis'' was released in South Africa. This was recalled immediately upon request from the U.S. because it suggested the idea that the two performers were singing together. Although [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] and [[Decca Records]] were interested, she signed with the Belgian label [[Palette Records|Palette]] in 1960.\n\n===Later career===\nBy 1960, Martin was on her second marriage, and her husband demanded she leave the music business. In the 1970s, she began performing again with her newly formed band, The Variations. In 1975, she was working for the [[Halifax, Virginia]], Police Department when music historian Dennis West tracked her down. Edd Bayes, a record collector from Maryland, asked Dennis for her address, which Dennis gave to him. He then coaxed her to appear locally and tell her story in ''Goldmine'' magazine. Martin toured through Europe as part of the rockabilly revival there, and in 1979 Bayes convinced RCA to pull four Martin songs from their vault, which were then released on [[Dog Gone Records]] in 1977. Edd Bayes took one of the songs that had been recorded twice (\"Love Me Love\") at different tempos and added the 'cha cha' to the title. In the 1980s, the [[Bear Family]] label gathered Martin's complete record history with the compilation album ''The Female Elvis''. Since the early 1980s Janis started performing again at Rockabilly shows through Europe and the US. One of her live shows was released on a CD called ''Here I Am'' on [[Hydra Records]].  In 1995, Martin appeared on [[Rosie Flores]]'s ''Rockabilly Filly'' album for [[HighTone Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockabilly Filly Overview|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rockabilly-filly-mw0000177263|website=AllMusic.com|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Flores recorded an album with Martin six months before her death, but it was not released until September 18, 2012, as [[The Blanco Sessions]] by [[Cow Island Music]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Janis Martin, 'The Female Elvis,' Returns|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/30/161968431/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-returns|website=NPR Music|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Flores|first1=Rosie|title=JANIS MARTIN \" The Female Elvis\", Final Recording Sessions|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1383637978/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-final-recording-sess|website=Kickstarter|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nMartin died from cancer on September 3, 2007, at [[Duke University Medical Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].

His best known record was \"Ten Long Fingers\", recorded in 1958.\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Dallas, Texas]], he was encouraged to be an entertainer as a child.  He initially learned the [[steel guitar]],<ref name=Morrison>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qAHvUO5GknMC&dq=%22joe+poovey%22&pg=PA158  Craig Morrison, ''Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly music and its makers'', University of Illinois Press, 1996, p.158]</ref> and made his first recordings at the age of 10.  Two years later, in 1953, he formed a group, the Hillbilly Boys, and started weekly broadcasts on radio station [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], soon followed by work as a disc jockey on the \"[[Big D Jamboree]]\" radio show. He also recorded several Christmas-themed songs, including \"Santa's Helper\", written by his father Bernice Poovey.  After opening a show for [[Elvis Presley]] in 1955, he instantly changed his musical style from traditional country music to rockabilly.  In 1957, as '''Jumping Joe Poovey''', he recorded \"Move Around\" on the [[Dixie Records|Dixie]] label, produced by Jim Shell in Dallas.  It was followed the next year by \"Ten Long Fingers\", a tribute to [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], on which he was credited as \"Groove Joe Poovey\" {{sic}}.   Although the record was later acclaimed as a classic rockabilly number, featuring piano by local prodigy C.B. Oliver, it was only locally successful, and Poovey remained working in the Dallas and [[Fort Worth]] area, recording occasionally for small local labels.<ref name=hall>[http://rockabillyhall.com/JoePoovey1.html  Groovey Joe Poovey at the Rockabilly Hall of Fame]</ref><ref name=tsha>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpo69  The Handbook of Texas Online: Groovey Joe Poovey]</ref><ref name=blackcat>[http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/groovey_joe_poovey.htm  Groovey Joe Poovey at Black Cat Rockabilly]</ref><ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-poovey-p366176/biography  Biography by Jason Ankeny at Allmusic.com]</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s he returned to playing country music and worked as a songwriter, his songs being recorded by such musicians as [[George Jones]] and [[Johnny Paycheck]].  In 1966, using the pseudonym '''Johnny Dallas''', he recorded \"Heart Full of Love\", which reached no. 62 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]].  However, follow-ups failed to match its success, and he retired from performing to concentrate on his work as a disc jockey, working on various radio stations in the Dallas \u2013 Fort Worth area.  In the 1970s, his earlier records began to be recognised by rockabilly fans in Europe, where he first performed in 1980, and unreleased recordings from the 1950s were made available.  He also began recording again, releasing several new singles under the name '''Texas Joe Poovey'''.  At the same time, he worked as a chauffeur on the film set of the ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' TV series.<ref name=hall/><ref name=tsha/><ref name=blackcat/><ref name=allmusic/>\n\nHe continued to make regular visits to Britain and Europe, performing both country and rockabilly music, into the 1990s.

He is best known for having hosted ''[[Hee Haw]]'', a nationally televised country variety show, from 1969 to 1997. Clark was an important and influential figure in [[country music]], both as a performer and in helping to popularize the genre.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Clark frequently guest-hosted for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and enjoyed a 30-million viewership for ''Hee Haw''. Clark was highly regarded and renowned as a guitarist, [[banjo]] player, and [[fiddle]]r.  He was skilled in the traditions of many genres, including classical guitar, country music, [[Latin music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and pop.  He had hit songs as a pop vocalist (e.g., \"[[Hier encore|Yesterday, When I Was Young]]\" and \"Thank God and Greyhound\"), and his instrumental skill had an enormous effect on generations of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and country musicians. He became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1987, and, in 2009, was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]]. He published his autobiography, ''My Life\u2014in Spite of Myself'', in 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-671-86434-7 |title=Nonfiction Book Review: 'My Life in Spite of Myself' |date=February 28, 1994 |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nClark was born April 15, 1933, in [[Meherrin, Virginia]],{{sfn|''Current Biography Yearbook''|1979|page=83}} one of five children<ref name=Thanki>{{cite news| url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/11/15/roy-clark-dead-85/1978910002/| title=Roy Clark, 'Hee Haw' co-host, Country Music Hall of Fame member, dies at 85| last=Thanki| first=Juli| newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]| location=Nashville| access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref> born to Hester Linwood Clark and Lillian Clark (Oliver).{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} His father was a tobacco farmer.{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} He spent his childhood in Meherrin and New York City, where his father moved the family to take jobs during the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} When Clark was 11 years old, his family moved to a home on 1st Street SE in the [[Washington Highlands, Washington, D.C.|Washington Highlands]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.,{{sfn|Clark|Eliot|1994|page=84}} after his father found work at the [[Washington Navy Yard]].{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}}\n\nClark's father was a semi-professional musician who played [[banjo]], [[violin|fiddle]], and guitar,{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} and his mother played piano.{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} The first musical instrument Clark ever played was a four-string cigar box with a ukulele neck attached to it,{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} which he picked up in elementary school.<ref name=rcinterview>{{cite magazine| title=The Roy Clark Interview| magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date=December 28, 1985| pages=RC-4, RC-12| access-date=November 15, 2018| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Roy%20Clark%22%20%22National%20Banjo%20Championship%22&pg=PT77}}</ref> His father taught Clark to play guitar{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} when Roy was 14 years old, and soon Clark was playing banjo, guitar, and [[mandolin]].{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}} \"Guitar was my real love, though,\" Clark later said. \"I never copied anyone, but I was certainly influenced by them; especially by [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]].

[[Country-western]] music was widely derided by Clark's schoolmates, leaving him socially isolated. Clowning around, he felt, helped him to fit in again. Clark used humor as a musician as well, and it was not until the mid 1960s that he felt confident enough to perform in public without using humor in his act.<ref name=rcinterview />\n\nThe D.C. area had a number of country-western music venues at the time.

Since the 1950s, she has recorded and released music in the genres of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. She was among the first women to have a career in rock and roll, recording a series of 1950s singles that helped give her the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]] \"The Queen of Rockabilly\". She is also counted among the first female stars in the genre of country music.\n\nJackson began performing as a child and later had her own radio show in Oklahoma City. She was then discovered by country singer [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], who helped her secure a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] in 1954. At Decca, Jackson had her first hit single with the country song \"[[You Can't Have My Love]]\". She then began touring the following year with [[Elvis Presley]]. The two briefly dated and Presley encouraged her to record in the [[Rockabilly]] style. In 1956, Jackson signed with [[Capitol Records]] where she was given full permission to record both country and Rockabilly. The label released a string of Jackson's rock  singles, including \"[[Fujiyama Mama]]\", \"Mean Mean Man\" and the top 40 hit \"[[Let's Have a Party]]\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Jackson moved back to the country genre and had several charting singles during the decade. This included \"[[Right or Wrong (Wanda Jackson song)|Right or Wrong]]\", \"[[In the Middle of a Heartache]]\", \"[[Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine]]\" and \"[[A Woman Lives for Love]]\". In addition, she also recorded several selections for the German language market overseas. In 1965, the German single \"[[Santo Domingo (song)|Santo Domingo]]\" reached number one on the Austrian pop chart. After re-discovering [[Christianity]] in 1971, Jackson made [[gospel music]] a priority in her career. She left Capitol Records in 1973 and signed with [[Word Records]] to focus more on the gospel circuit. Over the next two decades, she released a series of gospel discs.\n\nIn 1984, Jackson was sought out by European promoters to tour overseas. The same year, she released her first rock album in two decades and launched a new career in the genre. In the 1990s, her rock records were noticed again by American audiences and she began touring alongside fellow Rockabilly artist [[Rosie Flores]]. During this period, she released several commercially acclaimed albums in the rock and roll style, including ''[[Heart Trouble (album)|Heart Trouble]]'' (2003) and ''[[I Remember Elvis]]'' (2006). Following her 2009 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Jackson collaborated with musician [[Jack White]] to record the commercially successful ''[[The Party Ain't Over]]''. For several years, she kept a busy touring schedule before announcing her retirement from performing in 2019. She released her 32nd and final studio project, ''[[Encore (2021 Wanda Jackson album)|Encore]]'', in 2021.\n\n==Early life==\nJackson was the only child born to parents Tom and Nellie Jackson in [[Maud, Oklahoma]].<ref name=\"Oklahoma\">{{cite web |last1=Carney |first1=George O. |title=Jackson, Wanda LaVonne: The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |website=Oklahoma History.org |access-date=9 July 2021 |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184947/https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |url-status=live }}</ref> Her father worked multiple jobs, including a gas station attendant and delivery truck driver.

Nellie Jackson often had Jackson sing while she was out of sight, to ensure her daughter was accounted for.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=6-8}} In Los Angeles, Jackson was introduced to [[western swing]] music.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She enjoyed hearing music by popular western acts like [[Bob Wills]] and [[Rose Maddox]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=8-10}} At age six, her father introduced Jackson to the guitar. She also took guitar lessons and was soon skillful enough to play it alongside her father.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}\n\nIn the mid 1940s, the family relocated to [[Bakersfield, California]] where Tom Jackson took a job as a [[barber]]. She also took piano lessons and continued to play the guitar.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}} It was during this period that she began having trouble with academics. Jackson recalled the experience in her book: \"All I wanted to do was sing and play music, and it was impossible for me to sit still,\" she recounted in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=15}} When Jackson was nine, the family moved back to their home state, this time living in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Her father found employment as a taxi cab driver and her mother worked on an air force base.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}}\n\nIn Oklahoma City, Jackson sang in the local Baptist church and engaged in more performance opportunities.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She auditioned for the local radio station, KPLR, after being peer-pressured by friends.

On Thompson's show, Jackson sang \"Blue Yodel No. 6\" backed by his band the Brazos Valley Boys. The performance led to a regular gig singing alongside [[Merl Lindsay]]'s country band.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=40-44}} Jackson was always performing, and at times neglected her social life. \"[Wanda] never had time for dates, nothing like that. Just that guitar \u2013 that's all she thought about,\" a high school friend recalled.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}\n\n==Career==\n===1953\u20131955: Country beginnings===\nJackson also continued working with Hank Thompson. In 1953, she appeared with him regularly on his local television program and on a similar program for 30 minutes hosted by KPLR. Thompson also recorded Jackson on several demonstration recordings in hopes they would be heard by major record labels. Thompson was also attempting to get his band member Billy Gray a recording contract, and had the pair sing several duets.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} Jackson was supposed to be signed by Thompson's label, [[Capitol Records]], but was rejected by producer [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. \"Girls don't sell records!\" he told Thompson.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}} In her book, Jackson recalled hearing Nelson's statement: \"I recognize that Ken wasn't being sexist, so much as he was thinking about business. But it still gave me a little nudge to prove him wrong!\"{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59}}\n\n[[File:Wanda Jackson--1956.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jackson was known for her spaghetti strap dresses, designed by her mother.]]\nInstead Thompson contacted [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]] of [[Decca Records]], who was interested in signing Jackson and Billy Gray.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} In 1954, while still high school, Jackson signed with the label.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201-202}} In March 1954, the Jackson family traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] where she recorded her first Decca sessions backed by Thompson's band. She cut several solo sides, along with the Billy Gray duet, \"[[You Can't Have My Love]]\". Jackson disliked the song, but Thompson convinced her to record it.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=60-62}} It was soon released as Jackson's debut single on Decca and became a major hit, climbing to the number eight spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Upon Decca's encouragement, Jackson and Gray recorded a second duet, titled \"If You Don't Somebody Else Will\". Released as a single, the song was a commercial failure due to a competing version by [[Jimmy & Johnny]] that reached the charts.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\" />{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=64}}\n\nInstead of touring, Jackson started her senior year in fall 1954 and finished high school. She was part of the school band and acted in the musical ''[[Anything Goes]]''.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=66-68}} In March 1955, she returned to the recording studio, this time working with Paul Cohen at the Decca studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

He sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|title= Johnny Cash Biography and Interview |website=Achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/johnny-cash/#interview}}</ref> He auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music. Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to \"go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell\". In a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786|title=The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues|newspaper=NPR|access-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, \"[[Hey Porter]]\" and \"[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]\", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.\n\nCash's next record, \"Folsom Prison Blues\", made the country top five. His \"[[I Walk the Line]]\" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. \"[[Home of the Blues]]\" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Cash felt that Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.\n\nIn 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]]. His single \"[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]\" became one of his biggest hits. He recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind such a backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]]\", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.{{Efn|When [[RCA Victor]] signed Presley, it had also bought his Sun Records masters, but when Cash departed for Columbia, Phillips retained the rights to the singer's Sun masters. Columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after Cash's death.}}\n[[File:Johnny Cash - Cash Box 1957.jpg|thumb|Cash on the cover of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' magazine, September 7, 1957]]\nEarly in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname \"the Undertaker\" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes.

June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short-lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html|title=Rainbow Quest|website=Richardandmimi.com|date=February 26, 1966|access-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]''. It was later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.\n\nCash's career was handled by [[Saul Holiff]], a [[London, Ontario]], promoter.

For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash would use the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]].\n\nAlthough he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity.

Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, he was held only one night each time. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers.

His ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964) was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. \n\nIn 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965) was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.\n\nReaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash and his first wife divorced after having separated in 1962. Some venues cancelled his performances, but he continued to find success.

Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. He was jailed for the night in [[LaFayette, Georgia]]. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation|page=5A|place=LaFayette, Georgia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621|newspaper=Rome News Tribune|date=August 14, 1970|title=12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref> \n\nReflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: \"I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me.\"<ref>Gross (2004). p. 34</ref> June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs.

In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]], making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled ''Highwayman'' in 1985, followed by ''Highwaymen 2'' in 1990, and concluding with ''Highwaymen&nbsp;\u2013 The Road Goes On Forever'' in 1995.\n\nDuring that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County (film)|Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life [[Murder in Coweta County|Georgia murder]] case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis.\n\nCash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an [[ostrich]] on his farm.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|title=Johnny Cash: The Rebel|website=Exclaim.ca|place=Canada|page=3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426225724/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|archive-date=April 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nAt a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a \"[[near-death experience]]\".\n\n{{Anchor|Chicken in Black}}\nIn 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled \"[[The Chicken in Black]]\" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book ''Johnny Cash: The Life'', disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash \u2013 who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as \"A Boy Named Sue\" and \"One Piece at a Time\" \u2013 accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked \"like a buffoon\" in the music video (which was showcased during Cash's 1984 Christmas TV special), and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from stores\u2014interrupting its bona fide chart success\u2014and termed the venture \"a fiasco\".<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''.

During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]'', a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[John Carter Cash]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]]. A [[Johnny Cash Country Christmas|one-off Christmas album]] recorded for [[Delta Records]] followed his Mercury contract.\n\nThough Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death, his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians [[Marc Riley]] (formerly of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and [[Jon Langford]] ([[the Mekons]]) put together '''Til Things Are Brighter'', a [[tribute album]] featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a \"morale booster\"; Rosanne Cash later said \"he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it\".

He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park. His drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement.

When asked why most of his songs were positive in their outlook, McDaniel told the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'' that \"there's enough things in the world to keep you bummed out\" and that his fans did not want to \"hear me singing something that's gonna bum 'em out some more.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tIIgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R8AEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2818,1429291&dq=mel+mcdaniel+real+good+feel+good+song&hl=en|title=Good Ol' Boy|last=Perala|first=Andrew|date=October 19, 1989|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|access-date=June 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMcDaniel was born in [[Checotah, Oklahoma]],<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=249}}</ref> a small town in [[McIntosh County, Oklahoma]], and grew up in [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma]]. He was inspired to play music after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] on television. His first interest in music was when he learned the trumpet in the fourth grade, but he soon learned the guitar.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> At age 14, he taught himself the guitar chords to \"[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie and Johnny]]\" and performed at a high-school talent contest. He made his professional debut at age 15 performing in a talent contest at Okmulgee High School. While in high school, he played in several local bands, and after graduation, began working as a musician in [[Tulsa]] clubs. While in Tulsa, he recorded several singles for local label [[J.J. Cale]] and wrote and produced his first single, \"Lazy Me\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===Career===\nAfter marrying his high school sweetheart, McDaniel began performing in Tulsa. From there, he had an unsuccessful trip to Nashville, followed by quite a bit of success in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], performing at clubs among the oil fields.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> After two years there, he returned to Nashville and landed a job as a demo singer and songwriter with Combine Music. With the help of music publisher [[Bob Beckham]], McDaniel signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1976 and released his first single, \"Have a Dream on Me\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nHis career finally took off with \"[[Louisiana Saturday Night]]\" in 1981, and in early 1985 he scored his only number one hit with \"[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Other Top 10 hits include \"[[Right in the Palm of Your Hand]]\" (later covered by [[Alan Jackson]] in 1999), \"[[Take Me to the Country (song)|Take Me to the Country]]\", \"[[Big Ole Brew]]\", \"[[I Call It Love (Mel McDaniel song)|I Call It Love]]\", and \"[[Real Good Feel Good Song]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nMcDaniel became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on January 11, 1986, and made frequent appearances on the show.\n\nMcDaniel was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]] in 2006, along with induction classmate [[Leon Russell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oklahomamusichalloffame.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/17/Default.aspx |title=By Year |access-date=April 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429194034/http://www.oklahomamusichalloffame.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/17/Default.aspx |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Later years, health, and death===\nOn November 14, 1996, he had a nearly fatal fall into an orchestra pit while he was performing at the Heymann Performing Arts Center in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].

In 1946 his family moved to [[Dallas]], where he played on [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]]'s ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. By 1951 he was playing on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''; that year he signed to [[Capitol Records]] and released his first single, \"I Keep the Blues All the Time\", as Jimmy Lee. Capitol released seven further singles from Fautheree before dropping him in 1952. Despite never charting, the recordings have been cited as influential on later rockabilly artists, including [[James Burton]].\n\nFautheree subsequently found work as a [[session musician]] for musicians such as [[Faron Young]] and [[Webb Pierce]]. Along with [[\"Country\" Johnny Mathis]], he performed on ''Louisiana Hayride'' as [[Jimmy & Johnny]], and released a charting single under the \"Jimmy Lee & Johnny Mathis\" moniker on [[Chess Records]], 1954's \"If You Don't, Somebody Else Will\". Fautheree left Mathis to work with Wayne Walker, a partnership that lasted only four months but yielded a few recordings. Following this he began recording with his brother Lynn, again under the name Jimmy & Johnny; they signed to [[Decca Records]], but by 1957 the pair had moved back to Dallas.\n\nFautheree went back to solo recording, recording in [[New Orleans]] in 1958 at J&M Studio. He recorded briefly with Mathis again between 1958 and 1959. Some self-released material and a single on [[Paula Records]] brought him into 1960, and throughout the next decade Fautheree worked increasingly in the genre of [[gospel music]].\n\nBy the 1970s Fautheree had left the business, working in [[asbestos]] removal. In 1995, he returned to music with Mathis, recording a new single, \"It Won't Be Much Longer\", together. He played both in the U.S. and abroad in the 2000s, and released a full-length album with [[Deke Dickerson]] entitled ''I Found the Doorknob''. Shortly after the album was complete he died of [[cancer]] in Dallas on June 29, 2004.\n\nHis mother's name was Lodema Hammonds, the daughter of Mack Hammonds of Maud, Texas, who was a descendant of [[Phillip Hamman]], the Savior of the Greenbrier.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"350\" | Title\n! width=\"150\" | Record label\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Love Is Hard To Understand / I Keep the Blues All The Time'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Go Ahead and Go / Knocking On Your Front Door'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Lips That Kiss So Sweetly / I\u2019ve Got A Broken Heart'' || Capitol Records \n|----\n| 1952 || ''Suspense / Warm Warm Kisses'' || Capitol Records \n|----\n| 1952 || ''I\u2019m Diggin\u2019 A Hole To Bury My Heart / Kisses By Mail'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1952 || ''Blowin\u2019 And Goin\u2019 / Mistakes'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1953 || ''How About A Date / Cryin\u2019 Won\u2019t Change My Mind'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1955 || ''Lips That Kiss So Sweetly / Love Me'' (with Wayne Walker) || Chess Records\n|----\n| 1958 || ''Teenage Wedding / Baby It\u2019s Love'' (as ''Johnny Angel'') || Vin Records\n|----\n| 1966 || ''Git / Can\u2019t Find The Doorknob'' || Paula Records  \n|----\n| 1966 || ''Keep Me In Mind / Belle Of Monterrey'' || Paula Records\n|----\n| 1974 || ''Project X-9 (Instr.) / I\u2019m The Laziest Man In The World'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| 197? || ''If You Want To Be Saved / Fellowship With Jesus'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| 197? || ''I Just Can\u2019t Keep On / One Day Smiling'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| unknown || ''This Ole House / Heaven Is Only Knee High'' || Little Richie Records\n|----\n| 1963 || '''''EP''''' \n* ''Nobody Knows Where You Go''\n* ''Please Talk To My Heart''\n* ''Taffy Town'' (by Fran Powers)\n* ''Goin\u2019 Steady'' (by Fran Powers)\n|| Towne House Records\n|}\n\n==References==\n*[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p75324/biography|pure_url=yes}} Jimmy Lee Fautheree] at [[Allmusic]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fautheree, Jimmy Lee}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American rockabilly musicians]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Arkansas]]\n[[Category:American session musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Smackover, Arkansas]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Arkansas]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

From age eight he starred alongside his family in the radio and television series ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''. In 1957, he began a long and successful career as a popular recording artist. \n\nHis fame as both a recording artist and television star also led to a motion picture role co-starring alongside [[John Wayne]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Walter Brennan]], and [[Angie Dickinson]] in [[Howard Hawks]]'s [[Western (genre)|western]] feature film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). He placed 54 songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and its predecessors between 1957 and 1973, including \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\" in 1958, which was the first number one song on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's then-newly created [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100 chart]]. He recorded 17 additional top ten hits and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on January 21, 1987.{{sfn|Whitburn|1983|p=491}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=284}} In 1996 Nelson was ranked No. 49 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.<ref name=\"fifty\" />\n\nNelson began his entertainment career in 1949, playing himself in the radio sitcom series ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet''. In 1952, he appeared in his first feature film, ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]''. In 1957, he recorded his first single (\"I'm Walkin' b/w \"A Teenager's Romance\", Verve 10047X4S), debuted as a singer on the television version of the sitcom, and released the No. 1 album ''[[Ricky (album)|Ricky]]''. In 1958, Nelson released his first #1 single, \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\", and in 1959 received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Most Promising Male Newcomer\" after starring in ''Rio Bravo''. A few films followed, and when the television series was cancelled in 1966, Nelson made occasional appearances as a guest star on various television programs. In his twenties, he moved away from the pop music of his youth and began to perform in a [[country rock]] style.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |title=Rick Nelson Biography |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2022-11-23 |archive-date=November 24, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124044719/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |url-status=live }}</ref> After recording several albums with mostly [[session musician]]s, most of which flopped, he formed the Stone Canyon Band in 1969 and experienced a career resurgence, buoyed by the live album ''[[In Concert at the Troubadour, 1969]]'' and had a surprise hit with 1972's \"[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]\", which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. His comeback was short-lived, however, as his record label was bought out and folded, and his followup albums were not well promoted by his new label. He continued to perform live and take small television roles through the 1970s, though his label dropped him by the end of the decade. He released two more albums, with unimpressive results, before [[Death of Ricky Nelson|his death in a plane crash]] on New Year's Eve, 1985.\n\nNelson was married once, to [[Kristin Nelson|Sharon Kristin Harmon]], from 1963 until their divorce in 1982. They had four children: actress [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Nelson]], twin sons and musicians [[Gunnar Nelson (musician)|Gunnar]] and [[Matthew Nelson (musician)|Matthew]], and actor Sam.\n\n==Early life==\nNelson was born on May 8, 1940, in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=2, 16\u201317}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=25}}<ref name=\"NOTE\" /> He was the second son of entertainment couple [[Ozzie Nelson|Ozzie]] and [[Harriet Nelson]].

The film was a hit, and Ozzie was convinced the family could make the transition from radio's airwaves to television's small screen. On October 3, 1952, ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' made its television debut and was broadcast in first run until September 3, 1966, to become one of the longest running sitcoms in television history.\n\n==Education==\nNelson attended Gardner Street Public School,{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=23}} Bancroft Junior High,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=47}} and, between 1954 and 1958, [[Hollywood High School]], from which he graduated with a B average.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} He played [[American football|football]] at Hollywood High{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} and represented the school in interscholastic [[tennis]] matches.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=55}} Twenty-five years later, Nelson told the ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' he hated school because it \"smelled of pencils\" and he was forced to rise early in the morning to attend.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}} In January 1960 the athletic Nelson brothers formed a trapeze act with stunts in the 1/27/1960 episode of \"Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" titled 'THE CIRCUS'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/579275570816609584/|title=RICKY NELSON on the TRAPEZE!

Nelson's first album, ''Ricky'', was released in October 1957 and hit #1 before the end of the year.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=76}} Following these successes, Nelson was given a more prominent role on the ''Ozzie and Harriet'' show and ended every two or three episodes with a musical number.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=80}}\n\nNelson grew increasingly dissatisfied performing with older jazz and country session musicians, who were openly contemptuous of rock and roll. After his Ohio and Minnesota tours in the summer of 1957, he decided to form his own band with members closer to his age.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=81}} Eighteen-year-old electric guitarist [[James Burton]] was the first signed. Bassist James Kirkland, drummer Richie Frost, and pianist Gene Garf completed the band.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=83}} Their first recording together was \"[[Believe What You Say]]\". Prior to this, [[Joe Maphis]] had been playing the lead guitar part, and played lead on his first hits \"Be-Bop Baby\", \"Stood Up\", and \"Waitin In School\".\n\nIn 1958, Nelson recorded 17-year-old [[Sharon Sheeley]]'s \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\" for his second album, ''Ricky Nelson'', released in June 1958.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=89}} Radio airplay brought the tune notice, and Imperial suggested releasing a single, but Nelson opposed the idea, believing a single would diminish EP sales. When a single was released nonetheless, he exercised his contractual right to approve any artwork and vetoed a picture sleeve.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=89\u201390}} On August 4, 1958, \"Poor Little Fool\" became the #1 single on ''Billboard'''s newly instituted Hot 100 singles chart{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=91}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=90}} and sold over two million copies.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}\n\nNelson stated:\n{{blockquote|Anyone who knocks rock 'n' roll either doesn't understand it, or is prejudiced against it, or is just plain square. \u2013 ''[[NME]]'' \u2013 November 1958<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 3\" />}}\n\n[[File:Ricky Nelson - publicity.JPG|thumb|Nelson publicity photo, 1960]]\nDuring 1958 and 1959, Nelson had twelve hits in the charts in comparison with [[Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley's]] eleven.

In the summer of 1958, Nelson conducted his first full-scale tour, averaging $5,000 nightly.

Ozzie Nelson even had the idea to edit footage together to create some of the first music videos. This creative editing can be seen in videos Ozzie produced for \"Travelin' Man\". Nelson appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1967, but his career by that time was in limbo. He also appeared on other television shows (usually in acting roles). In 1973, he had an acting role in an episode of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} He starred in the episode \"A Hand For Sonny Blue\" from the 1977 series ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (known in the United Kingdom as ''Twist in the Tale'').

Nelson worked with many musicians of repute, including [[James Burton]], [[Joe Osborn]], and [[Allen \"Puddler\" Harris]], all natives of [[Louisiana]], and [[Joe Maphis]], [[The Jordanaires]], [[Scotty Moore]], and [[Johnny Burnette|Johnny]] and [[Dorsey Burnette]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nNelson's music was very well recorded with a clear, punchy sound\u2014thanks in part to engineer Bunny Robyn and producer Jimmy Haskell.<ref name=\"Tech\" />\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, Nelson had 30 Top-40 hits, more than any other artist except Presley (who had 53) and [[Pat Boone]] (38).

He made his film debut in ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]'' (1952) and had a small role in ''[[The Story of Three Loves]]'' (1953) at MGM directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]] playing [[Farley Granger]] as a boy.\n\nFollowing his success on TV and with singing, [[Howard Hawks]] cast him as a gunslinger in ''[[Rio Bravo (movie)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959) with [[John Wayne]] and [[Dean Martin]]; Hawks attributed much of the film's box office success to Nelson.\n\nNelson co-starred with [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[The Wackiest Ship in the Army (film)|The Wackiest Ship in the Army]]'' (1960), which was popular enough to give rise to a TV series (in which Nelson did not appear). He guest starred on ''[[General Electric Theatre]]'' (\"The Wish Book\") and starred in a romantic comedy feature written and directed by his father, ''[[Love and Kisses (1965 movie)|Love and Kisses]]'' (1965) with [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]].\n\nNelson guest starred on ''[[Hondo (TV series)|Hondo]]'' (playing [[Jesse James]]), and had a support role in ''[[The Over-the-Hill Gang]]'' (1969) with [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]].\n\nNelson was in ''[[Fol-de-Rol]]'' (1972), guest starred on ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law]]'', ''[[Petrocelli]]'', ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected|A Twist in the Tale]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', and ''[[The Love Boat]]''. On ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' he played the part of \"Tony Eagle\" and performed various well-known Nelson songs throughout the episode.\n\nHe had support roles in the TV films ''[[Three on a Date]]'' and ''[[High School USA]]'' (1983).\n\n==Name change and 1960s career==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2022}}\nOn May 8, 1961 (his 21st birthday), he officially modified his recording name from \"Ricky Nelson\" to \"Rick Nelson\". His childhood nickname proved hard to shake, especially among the generation who had watched him grow up on \"Ozzie and Harriet\". Even in the 1980s, when Nelson realized his dream of meeting [[Carl Perkins]], Perkins noted that he and \"Ricky\" were the last of the \"rockabilly breed\".\n\nIn 1963, Nelson signed a 20-year contract with [[Decca Records]]. After some early successes with the label, most notably 1964's \"For You\" (#6), Nelson's chart career came to a dramatic halt in the wake of [[Beatlemania]], [[The British Invasion]], and later the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture era]]. However, instead of dropping him, Decca kept him on board.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Nelson began to move toward [[country music]], becoming a pioneer in the country-rock genre. He was one of the early influences of the so-called \"[[California Sound]]\" (which would include singers like [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] and bands such as [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]). Yet Nelson himself did not reach the [[Top 40]] again until 1970, when he recorded [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"She Belongs to Me\" with the Stone Canyon Band, featuring [[Randy Meisner]], who in 1971 became a founding member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and former [[The Buckaroos|Buckaroo]] steel guitarist [[Tom Brumley]].\n\n==\"Garden Party\" and short-lived comeback==\n[[File:Rick Nelson performing 1970.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Nelson performing on ''The Jim Nabors Show'' in 1970]]\nIn 1972, Nelson reached the Top 40 one last time with \"[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]],\" a song he wrote in disgust after a [[Richard Nader]] [[Oldies]] Concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] where the audience booed, perhaps against some unrelated police action. However, Nelson may have felt that the reason was because he was playing new songs instead of just his old hits.<ref name=\"straightdope1\" /> When he performed [[The Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Honky Tonk Women]],\" there was booing, said to be against police and not him.<ref name=\"straightdope1\" /> He was watching the rest of the performance on a TV monitor backstage until Richard Nader finally convinced Nelson to return to the stage and play his \"oldies.\" He returned to the stage and played his \"oldies\" and the audience responded with applause, according to Deborah Nader, President of Richard Nader Entertainment. He wanted to record an album featuring original material, but the single was released before the album because Nelson had not completed the entire ''Garden Party'' album yet. \"Garden Party\" reached No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #1 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart]] and was certified as a [[RIAA certification|gold single]]. The second single released from the album was \"Palace Guard\" which peaked at #65.\n\nIn 1973, [[MCA Records]], whose parent company [[MCA Inc.]] had owned American Decca since 1962, ceased the label's operations, and transferred Nelson (and many other Decca artists) to its roster. His comeback was short-lived, and Nelson's band soon resigned. MCA wanted Nelson to have a producer on his next album. A new band was formed by [[Lindy Goetz]], then a promotion person at MCA Records.<ref name=\"GoodReads\" /> Nelson's band moved to Aspen and changed their name to \"Canyon.\" Nelson and the new Stone Canyon Band began to tour for the ''[[Garden Party (album)|Garden Party]]'' album. Nelson still played nightclubs and bars, but he soon advanced to higher-paying venues because of the success of ''Garden Party.''\n\nIn 1974, MCA was unsure as to what to do with the former teen idol. Albums like ''[[Windfall (Rick Nelson album)|Windfall]]'' failed to have an impact. Nelson became an attraction at theme parks like [[Knott's Berry Farm]] and [[Disneyland]]. He also started appearing in minor roles on television shows.\n\nNelson tried to score another hit but did not have any luck with songs like \"Rock and Roll Lady.\" With seven years to go on his contract, MCA dropped him from the label.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Rick kris nelson 1964.JPG|thumb|Ricky and Kristin Nelson in 1964]]\n\nIn 1957, when Nelson was 17, he met and fell in love with [[Marianne Gaba]], who played the role of Ricky's girlfriend in three episodes of ''Ozzie and Harriet''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=136}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=72}} Nelson and Gaba were too young to enter a serious relationship, although according to Gaba \"we used to [[Making out|neck]] ''for hours''.\"{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=137}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=73}}\n\nThe next year, Nelson fell in love with 15-year-old [[Lorrie Collins]], a country singer appearing on a weekly telecast called ''Town Hall Party''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=106}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=81}} The two wrote Nelson's first composition, the song \"My Gal\", and she introduced him to [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Tex Ritter]].

In October 1977, Kris filed for divorce and asked for alimony, custody of their four children, and a portion of community property. The couple temporarily resolved their differences, but Kris retained her attorney to pursue a permanent break.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=230}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=205}} Kris wanted Rick to give up music, spend more time at home, and focus on acting, but the family enjoyed a recklessly expensive lifestyle, and Kris's extravagant spending left Rick no choice but to tour relentlessly.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=251}} The impasse over Rick's career created unpleasantness at home.

Although he recorded three more songs with Mercury, his contract was soon terminated.<ref name=mcdowell />\n\n===Rock and roll career===\nIn 1958, Twitty's fortunes improved when an Ohio radio station had an inspiration, refraining from playing \"I'll Try\" (an MGM single that went nowhere in terms of sales, radio play, and [[jukebox]] play), instead playing the B-side, \"[[It's Only Make Believe]]\", a song written between sets by Twitty and drummer Jack Nance when they were in Hamilton, Ontario, playing at the Flamingo Lounge.<ref name=\"MEMPROJ44\">{{Cite press release |title=The Hamilton Memory Project |date=June 10, 2006 |publisher=Hamilton Spectator Newspaper, Souvenir Edition |page=MP44}}</ref> The record took several months to reach and stay at the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1958|top spot]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop music charts in the United States and number 1 in 21 other countries, becoming the first of nine top-40 hits for Twitty.

Twitty would go on to enjoy rock-and-roll success with songs including \"[[Danny Boy]]\" (Pop number 10) and \"[[Lonely Blue Boy (song)|Lonely Blue Boy]]\" (Pop number 6). \"Lonely Blue Boy\", originally titled \"Danny\", was recorded by Presley for the film ''[[King Creole]]'' but was not used in the soundtrack. This song led to him naming his band the Lonely Blue Boys. They subsequently became the Twitty Birds.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> As his recording career continued, Twitty's music shifted from rockabilly to [[rock and roll]], and Twitty also recorded some [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]] singles.<ref name=Koda/>\n\nBy 1965, Twitty had become disillusioned with rock & roll, particularly with the behavior of the fans,<ref name=ellison /> and walked out of a show in the middle of a performance in New Jersey.<ref name=bronson/> He sued his manager to be released from his contract, and moved to perform country music in [[Oklahoma City]].<ref name=ellison>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1qyHCmpT7EC&pg=PA248 |title=Country Music Culture: From Hard Times to Heaven|first= Curtis W. |last=Ellison |date= 1995|isbn=9781604739343 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi|page=248}}</ref>\n\n===Country music career===\nTwitty always wanted to record country music, and, beginning in 1965, he did just that. Disc jockeys on some country-music radio stations refused to play his first few country albums, because he was known as a rock and roll singer. However, he had his first top-five country hit, \"The Image of Me\", in July 1968, followed by his first number one country song, \"[[Next in Line (Conway Twitty song)|Next in Line]]\", in November 1968. Few of his singles beginning in 1968 ranked below the top five.\n\nIn 1970, Twitty recorded and released his biggest country hit, \"[[Hello Darlin' (song)|Hello Darlin']]\", which spent four weeks at the top of the country chart and is one of Twitty's most recognized songs. In 1971, he released his first hit duet with [[Loretta Lynn]], \"[[After the Fire Is Gone]]\". It was a success, and many more followed, including \"[[Lead Me On (Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn song)|Lead Me On]]\" (1971), \"[[Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man (song)|Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man]]\" (1973), \"[[As Soon As I Hang Up the Phone]]\" (1974), \"[[Feelins']]\" (1975), \"I Still Believe in Waltzes\", \"[[I Can't Love You Enough]]\", and many others. Together, Conway and Loretta (as they were known in their act) won four consecutive [[Country Music Association]] awards for vocal duo (1972\u20131975) and a host of other duo and duet awards from other organizations throughout the 1970s.\n\nIn 1973, Twitty released \"[[You've Never Been This Far Before]]\", which was number 1 in country for three weeks that September and also reached number 22 on the pop charts. Some more conservative disc jockeys refused to play the song, believing that some of the lyrics were too sexually suggestive.\n\nIn 1978, Twitty issued the single \"The Grandest Lady of Them All\" honoring the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''. (Somewhat ironically, Twitty was never inducted into the ''Opry'' during his lifetime; he remains one of the more prominent [[Nashville]] country artists never to have been an Opry member.) The single reached the top 20, peaking at number 16, but it was well below expectations; it was the first time since 1967 that a single of his failed to reach the top ten, as some radio stations refused to play a song honoring the property of a competitor (broadcast by [[WSM-AM]]).\n\nTwitty soon renewed his image with a new hairstyle, changing from the slicked-back [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]] style to the curlier style he would keep for the rest of his life; by the late 1970s, Twitty had shifted his musical arrangements into a [[country pop]] style he would maintain for the rest of his career.<ref name=Kamau>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicrockhistory.com/top-10-conway-twitty-songs/ |title=Top 10 Conway Twitty Songs |last=Kamau |first=Eric |date=January 2022 |publisher=Classic Rock History |access-date=2022-11-18}}</ref> His next 23 consecutive singles all made it into the top 10, with 13 reaching number one, including \"[[Don't Take It Away]]\", \"[[I May Never Get to Heaven]]\", \"[[Happy Birthday Darlin']]\", and remakes of major pop hits such as \"[[The Rose (song)|The Rose]]\", \"[[Slow Hand]]\" and \"Tight Fittin' Jeans\", a song written by Michael Huffman, released in June 1981 as the first single from the album ''Mr. T''. The song was Twitty's 26th number one on the country chart. The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of 10 weeks on the country chart. In 1985, going by all weekly music trade charts, the song \"[[Don't Call Him a Cowboy]]\" became the 50th single of his career to achieve a number-one ranking. He would have five more through 1990, giving him a total of 55 number-one hits. [[George Strait]] matched the feat of 50 number-one hits in 2002 with his single \"[[She'll Leave You with a Smile]]\" and then reached number 1 for the 56th time in 2007, when the single \"[[Wrapped (Bruce Robison song)|Wrapped]]\" hit the top on the Media Base 24/7 list.\n\nThroughout much of Twitty's country music career his recording home was Decca Records, later renamed [[MCA Records|MCA]]. He signed with the label in late 1965 but left in 1981, when it appeared MCA was marketing and promoting newer acts; management at the label had changed, in addition to other factors that brought on the decision. He joined Elektra/Asylum in 1982. That label's country music unit merged with sister label [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1983. He stayed with Warner Bros. through early 1987 but then went back to MCA to finish his career. In 1993, shortly before he died, he recorded a new album, ''[[Final Touches]]''.\n\n===Films===\nTwitty had a short career in films, appearing in a few [[B-movies]] in 1960 in which he acted and sang, starting with ''[[Platinum High School]]'', followed by ''[[College Confidential (film)|College Confidential]]'' and ''[[Sex Kittens Go to College]]''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjrAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA409 |title=Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary|first= Richard |last=Carlin |date= 2014|isbn=9781135361044 |publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=409}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT4UAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA204 |title=All Roots Lead to Rock: Legends of Early Rock 'n' Roll : a Bear Family Reader |author= Bear Family Records |date= 1999 |publisher=Schirmer Books|page=204|isbn=9780028648668 }}</ref>\n\n===Baseball===\n[[File:Conway Twitty Nashville Sounds first pitch April 26, 1978.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Twitty throwing out the first pitch at the first [[Nashville Sounds]] game on April 26, 1978]]\nTwitty also played baseball, his second passion.

His first marriage, to Ellen Matthews, lasted from 1953 to 1954. They had married because Ellen was pregnant with their son, Michael. His second, and longest, marriage was to Temple \"Mickey\" Medley. They were married in 1956 and had three children: Kathy, Joni Lee, and Jimmy Twitty. The couple were divorced in early 1970, but they remarried quietly by the end of 1970. By 1984, after 28 years of marriage on and off, the stress of Twitty's frequent absences took its toll on Mickey, and she and Conway divorced. Mickey Twitty died in 2021. In 1987, Twitty married his 36-year-old office secretary, Delores \"Dee\" Henry, who became his widow in June 1993.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hevesi |first=Dennis |date=June 6, 1993 |title=Conway Twitty, 59, Dies on Tour; Country Star Had 50 No. 1 Songs |language=en-US |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/obituaries/conway-twitty-59-dies-on-tour-country-star-had-50-no-1-songs.html |access-date=2021-11-09 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nTwitty made [[Oklahoma City]] his home during most of his recording career, from 1963 to 1972.

[[John Hughey]], who was Twitty's steel guitar player, found him on the ground. Many people, including family members, said that Twitty underwent a change in personality after the accident.\n\nTwitty served on the board of directors of [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] (Country Music Television) from 1984 to 1988, after Music Village Group (Nyhl Henson, Gilbert Biggers, Hall Hardaway Jr. and Benny and Dean Jaggers) acquired CMTV from Glen Daniels. (Inheriting a copyright infringement suit from Viacom, owner of MTV, settled for an undisclosed sum.) The Music Village Group, built Music Village USA adjacent to Twitty City including a state-of-the-art 1,776-seat theatre where CMT uplinked its 24-hour programming and produced live concerts. When Music Village and Twitty was sold in 1989 and CMT in 1990, Conway turned his attention to the burgeoning [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] market playing to sell-out crowds.

Conway's most recent appearance on the country charts was a duet with [[Anita Cochran]], \"(I Want to Hear) A Cheating Song\" (2004), which was made possible by splicing Twitty's vocal from old recordings and interviews, recorded over the years. As a result, Twitty's isolated vocal track was transferred to a digital multitrack and digitally reassembled into the new performance. Like the electronic duets of [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Jim Reeves]], [[Hank Williams]] and [[Hank Williams Jr.]], or [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Natalie Cole]], Cochran added her vocal to backing tracks that had already been produced along with Twitty's reconstructed vocals.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nCurrently, Bear Family Records offers the single-disc collection ''Conway Rocks'', featuring 30 songs, and ''The Rock 'n' Roll Years'', a comprehensive eight-disc box set showcasing his complete early recordings as a rock artist.<ref>[https://www.bear-family.com/twitty-conway/ Who was/is Twitty, Conway?] Bear Family Records.</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n===Taxes===\nTwitty's success in country music was a key factor in his winning the 1983 case ''Harold L. Jenkins (a/k/a Conway Twitty) v. Commissioner'' in United States Tax Court. The Internal Revenue Service allowed Twitty to deduct from his taxes, as an \"ordinary and necessary\" business expense, payments that he had made to repay investors in a defunct fast-food chain called Twitty Burger; the chain disestablished in 1971.

His widow in 1993, Delores \"Dee\" Henry Jenkins, and his four grown children from the previous marriages, Michael, [[Joni Lee|Joni]], Kathy and Jimmy Jenkins, engaged in a public dispute over the estate. Twitty's will had not been updated to account for the fourth marriage, but Tennessee law reserves one third of any estate to the widow. After years of probate, the four children received the rights to Twitty's music, name and image. The rest of the estate went to public auction, where much of the property and memorabilia was sold after his widow rejected the appraised value.\n\nIn 2008, controversy again erupted in his family when the four remaining children sued [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] over an agreement that Twitty and his family signed in 1990. The suit alleged that the terms of the agreement were not fully understood by the children, although they were all adults at the time. It sought to recover copyrights and royalty revenue that the document assigned to the company.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 1, 2008 |title=Twitty's children sue Sony for royalties |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/conway-twitty/news/twittys-children-sue-sony-for-royalties--57964316 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712082622/http://new.music.yahoo.com/conway-twitty/news/twittys-children-sue-sony-for-royalties--57964316 |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

He was raised by his maternal grandparents in [[Louise, Mississippi]], where they had a small farm and [[dry goods]] store.\n\nSmith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the [[United States Air Force]] stationed in San Antonio, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], and auditioned, successfully, to play the Cotton Club, a local nightclub. The steel guitarist [[Stan Kesler]], who was playing there with the Snearly Ranch Boys, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to [[Sun Records]] to audition for [[Sam Phillips]], with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup.\n\nPhillips liked what he heard and decided that \"Rock 'n' Roll Ruby\", a song credited to [[Johnny Cash]], would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that the song was actually written by [[George Jones]] and sold to Cash for $40.){{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Smith recorded it on February 5, 1956. Phillips, playing it safe in case rock and roll did not maintain its popularity, released it with a country crooner, aptly named \"I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry\", on the flip side. By May 26, \"Rock 'n' Roll Ruby\" had reached number 1 on the local pop chart; this record, his first for Sun, went on to outsell the first Sun releases by [[Elvis Presley]], Johnny Cash and [[Carl Perkins]].\n\nIn August 1956, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release, \"[[Ubangi Stomp]]\", an infectious rocker with crude lyrics and vocals suggesting an African chief with the [[syntax]] of a movie Indian. For the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], he recorded the classic ballad \"[[The Gypsy Laddie|Black Jack David]]\", a song that originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American South; it may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock-and-roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success, this record did not sell as well as Smith's debut.\n\nIn 1957, Smith recorded \"So Long, I'm Gone\", a song written by [[Roy Orbison]]. It became his biggest hit for Sun, peaking at number 74 on the ''Billboard'' national chart. But Sun had no cash to promote it, as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On]]\". Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun, including a [[cover version]] of [[Slim Harpo]]'s \"Got Love If You Want It\" (recorded in October 1957), but these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958, seeing his future in [[country music]], he cut a final record for Sun, a cover version of [[Don Gibson]]'s \"Sweet Sweet Girl\". In spite of a review in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' calling it \"ultra commercial\", this record also did not sell well. Like other artists such as [[Sonny Burgess]], [[Hayden Thompson]], [[Billy Lee Riley]] and [[Ray Harris]], Smith had little success on the charts.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Du Noyer\n| year= 2003\n| title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music\n| edition= \n| publisher= Flame Tree Publishing \n| location= Fulham, London\n| isbn= 1-904041-96-5\n| page= 19}}</ref> He then decided to leave Sun Records.\n\nIn 1959, Smith and his wife and son moved from Mississippi to California, settling in Sherman Oaks, not far from Johnny and Vivian Cash. Cash offered Smith a spot on his show, but Smith turned it down, seeing himself as a headliner, not a supporting player. In early 1960, Smith signed a contract with [[Liberty Records]] and immediately had a hit with \"I Don't Believe I'll Fall in Love Today\", which went to number 5 on the ''Billboard'' country and Western chart. This record and subsequent Liberty releases were produced by [[Joe Allison]] and featured one of California's best country session musicians, [[Ralph Mooney]], on [[pedal steel guitar]]. Smith scored again with his next record for Liberty, \"Odds and Ends, Bits and Pieces\", written by [[Harlan Howard]]. He recorded several more tracks for Liberty, mostly cover versions of recent country hits, to fill out an album, ''The First Country Collection of Warren Smith''. He continued to record for Liberty, with some success, and toured with his band, from 1960 to 1965.\n\nOn August 17, 1965, Smith suffered severe back injuries in a car crash in [[LaGrange, Texas]]. It took nearly a year for him to recover. By this time, his contract with Liberty had lapsed. He made several attempts to restart his career, first with a small, virtually amateur label called Skill Records, and then with [[Mercury Records]], but addictions to pills and alcohol held him back. Eventually, he was convicted of robbing a pharmacy and sentenced to an 18-month term in an Alabama prison.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Smith again tried to restart his career. He got some publicity from the rockabilly revival in the late 1970s. In 1977 he was invited to appear at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], on a bill featuring [[Charlie Feathers]], [[Buddy Knox]] and [[Jack Scott (singer)|Jack Scott]]. To his shock, Smith was received in London with standing ovations. His reception in England boosted his spirits and, upon his return to the United States, he began to perform with newfound vigor. In November 1978, Smith and fellow Sun alumnus [[Ray Smith (rockabilly singer)|Ray Smith]] toured Europe, again with great success.\n\nSmith died of a heart attack, at 47 years of age, in 1980, while preparing for another European tour.\n\n==Legacy==\nSmith's contribution to rockabilly music has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. [[Bob Dylan]] repeatedly featured Smith on his [[XM Satellite Radio]] show, ''[[Theme Time Radio Hour]]'', playing Smith's records \"Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache\", \"Uranium Rock\", \"Ubangi Stomp\" and \"So Long, I'm Gone\". Dylan recorded a studio version of \"Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache\" in 2001; he also played that song and another recorded by Smith, \"Uranium Rock\", in concert in 1986. \nIn 2015, \"Uranium Rock\" was also featured in the video game ''[[Fallout 4]]''. \"Uranium Rock\" was also covered by [[The Cramps]] on their second compilation album \"Bad Music For Bad People\".\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Thompson then joined the Dixie Jazzlanders who toured Mississippi.  He relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and made an unreleased recording in 1956.  \"Love My Baby\" was issued on the Phillips International label in September 1957, and Thompson toured alongside [[Sonny Burgess]] and [[Billy Lee Riley]].  The following year, Thompson moved again, this time to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he gained a residency at the Rivoli Ballroom, Chicago's latest country music venue.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\nThompson's recording of \"$16.88\" for [[Kapp Records]] sold sufficiently to secure him an offer to record his debut album.  ''Here's Hayden Thompson'' was released in 1967.  Several recordings took place in the early-1970s, but circumstances meant that Thompson left the music industry at this point and worked as a limo driver.  He re-emerged in the mid-1980s, becoming a regular performer on rockabilly revival touring packages.  Charley Records released an album of his in 1985.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>  Further albums were released, mainly by various European record labels, over the three decades.

He was strongly influenced by his parents, who were members of the Landmark Missionary Baptist Church; his mother, Helen Rich, played piano in church and his father sang in gospel quartets. A black sharecropper on the family land named C. J. Allen taught Rich blues piano. He enrolled at [[Arkansas State College]] on a football scholarship and then after an injury, transferred to the [[University of Arkansas]] as a music major. He left after one semester to join the [[United States Air Force]] in 1953.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nHe married Margaret Ann Greene in 1952. While stationed in [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]], Oklahoma, he formed \"the Velvetones\", playing jazz and blues and featuring his wife on vocals.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> When he left the military in 1956, the couple returned to the West Memphis area to farm 500 acres. He also began performing in clubs around the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] area, playing both jazz and [[R&B]], and began writing his own material.\n\n==Career==\nAfter recording some demonstration songs for [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]] that Phillips considered \"too jazzy\" and insufficiently commercial, Rich was given a stack of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] records and told: \"Come back when you get that bad.\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In a 1992 interview with ''[[Fresh Air]]'' host [[Terry Gross]], Rich himself recalled [[Bill Justis]] telling Rich's wife those words.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=129612715 |title=Charlie Rich: The Silver Fox With A Big Country Sound |publisher=Npr.org |date=September 6, 2010 |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Rich became a regular [[session musician]] for Sun Records, playing on a variety of records by Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bill Justis]], [[Warren Smith (singer)|Warren Smith]], [[Billy Lee Riley]], [[Carl Mann]], and [[Ray Smith (rockabilly singer)|Ray Smith]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He also wrote several songs for Lewis, Cash, and others.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAfter he began recording for the Sun subsidiary [[Phillips International Records]], his third single was the 1960 Top 30 hit \"Lonely Weekends\",<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> with [[Elvis Presley|Presley]]-like vocals.

In 1965 he moved to [[Smash Records]], where his new producer, [[Jerry Kennedy]], encouraged him to emphasize his country and rock n' roll leanings, although Rich considered himself a jazz pianist and had not paid much attention to country music since childhood.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> His first single for Smash was \"Mohair Sam\", an R&B-inflected [[Novelty song|novelty]]-rock number written by [[Dallas Frazier]], which became a top 30 pop hit. It has been mentioned in thousands of articles as the song Elvis Presley   played on his jukebox during the Beatles' visit to his home on August 26, 1965. However, once more none of his follow-up singles were successful. Rich again changed labels, moving to [[Hi Records]], where he recorded [[blue-eyed soul]] music and straight country, but once more, none of his singles for Hi made a dent on the country or pop charts. One Hi Records track, \"Love Is After Me\" (1966), belatedly became a [[white soul]] favorite in the early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\n===Career peak in the 1970s===\nDespite his lack of consistent commercial success, [[Epic Records]] signed Rich in 1967, mainly on the recommendation of producer [[Billy Sherrill]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Sherrill helped Rich refashion himself as a [[Nashville Sound]] balladeer during an era when old rock 'n' roll artists like Jerry Lee Lewis and [[Conway Twitty]] were finding a new musical home in the Country format. This new \"[[countrypolitan]]\" Rich sound paid off in the summer of 1972, when \"I Take It on Home\" went to number six on the country charts.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The title track from his 1973 album ''Behind Closed Doors'' became a number-one country hit early in that year, then crossed over into the top 20 on the pop charts.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> This time, his follow-up single did not disappoint, as \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl]]\" spent three weeks at the top of the country charts and two weeks at the top of the pop charts.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Now that he was established as a country music star, ''Behind Closed Doors'' won three awards from the [[Country Music Association]] that year: Best Male Vocalist, Album of the Year, and Single of the Year. The album was also certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]]. Rich won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, and he took home four [[Academy of Country Music]] awards. One of [[RCA Victor]]'s several resident songwriters, Marvin Walters, co-wrote for three years with Rich, producing four recordings including the popular \"Set Me Free\".{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\nAfter \"The Most Beautiful Girl,\" number-one hits came quickly, five songs topping the country charts in 1974 and crossed over to the pop charts:<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"There Won't Be Anymore\" (pop number 18), \"[[A Very Special Love Song]]\" (pop number 11), \"I Don't See Me In Your Eyes Anymore\" (pop number 47), \"I Love My Friend\" (pop number 24), and \"She Called Me Baby\" (pop number 47). Both RCA Records and [[Mercury Records]] (Smash was a subsidiary of Mercury that was absorbed into the main company in 1970) also re-released his previously recorded material from the mid-1960s.

His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website:<blockquote>I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis.&nbsp;... So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed.&nbsp;... Primarily he thought it would be funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver.<ref name=\"charlierichjr.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierichjr.com/controversy/the_envelope_burning/ |title=The Envelope Burning |publisher=Charlie Rich Jr. |access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe slump in Rich's career was exacerbated by the fact that his records began to sound increasingly similar: pop-inflected country ballads with [[overdub]]bed [[string instruments|strings]] and little jazz or blues. He did not have a top-10 hit again until \"[[Rollin' With the Flow]]\" went to number one on the country charts (as well as number 32 on the easy listening charts) in 1977.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Early the following year, in 1978, he signed with [[United Artists Records]], and throughout that year, he had hits on both Epic and UA. His hits in 1978 included the top-10 hits \"Beautiful Woman\", \"Puttin' In Overtime At Home\", and his last number one with \"[[On My Knees (1978 song)|On My Knees]]\", a duet with [[Janie Fricke]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===Decline in activity and semi-retirement===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2022}}\nIn 1979, Rich had moderate success with his singles, his biggest hit being a version of \"[[Spanish Eyes (1965 song)|Spanish Eyes]]\" that entered the country top 20.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Greatest Country Hits of 1979 |url=http://www.severing.nu/music/c1979.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=www.severing.nu}}</ref> He appeared as himself in the 1978 [[Clint Eastwood]] movie ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way but Loose]]'', performing \"I'll Wake You Up When I Get Home\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> This song hit number three on the country charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 country single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to [[Elektra Records]] and that fall released a number-12 country single, \"A Man Just Don't Know What a Woman Goes Through\". One more top-40 hit followed, the [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]] song \"Are We Dreamin' the Same Dream\" early in 1981. Also in 1981, he had a bit part in the movie ''[[Take This Job and Shove It (film)|Take This Job and Shove It]]'', which yielded his last charted single, \"You Made It Beautiful\". Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight, and for over a decade he lived off his investments in semi-retirement, only playing occasional concerts. \n\nIn 1992, Rich emerged from his semi-retirement to release on [[Sire Records]] ''Pictures and Paintings'', a jazzy album produced by journalist [[Peter Guralnick]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It received positive critical reviews and restored Rich's reputation as a musician, but it was his last album.

Siblings included brothers Jay and Clayton.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 8\u20139.]]</ref> The boys grew up hearing [[Southern gospel]] music sung by white friends in church and by black field workers and sharecroppers in the cotton fields.<ref name=pc8>{{Pop Chronicles|8|3}}</ref> On Saturday nights Perkins would listen to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', broadcast from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on his father's radio.\n\n[[Roy Acuff]]'s broadcasts from the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor.]]</ref> Since they could not afford to buy one, his father made one from a [[cigar box guitar|cigar box]] and a broomstick. Eventually, a neighbor sold his father a worn-out [[Gene Autry]] guitar. Perkins could not afford new strings, and when they broke, he had to retie them. The knots cut his fingers when he would slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of [[blue note]].<ref name=\"naylor118\" /><ref name=\":0\">[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 13\u201314.]]</ref>\n\nPerkins taught himself parts of Acuff's \"[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|Great Speckled Bird]]\" and \"[[The Wabash Cannonball]]\", having heard them played on the ''Opry''. He also has cited [[Bill Monroe]]'s fast playing and vocals as an early influence.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 11\u201312.]]</ref> Perkins also learned from John Westbrook, an African-American field worker in his sixties who played blues and gospel music on an old acoustic guitar. Westbrook advised Perkins to \"Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate.\"<ref name=\"naylor118\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn January 1947, the Perkins family moved from [[Lake County, Tennessee]], to [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]], 70 miles from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the largest city in West Tennessee and a center of a great variety of music played by both black and white artists.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 55.]]</ref> At age fourteen Perkins wrote a country song called \"Let Me Take You to the Movie, Magg\". [[Sam Phillips]] was later persuaded by the quality of that song to sign Perkins to his [[Sun Records]] label.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 68.]]</ref>\n\n===Beginnings as a performer===\nPerkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainers during late 1946 at the Cotton Boll tavern on Highway 45, twelve miles south of Jackson, Tennessee, starting on Wednesday nights. Perkins was 14 years old. One of the songs they played was an up-tempo country blues shuffle version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\". Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a tavern, and Perkins drank four beers that first night. Within a month Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch tavern, near the western boundary of Jackson.

Columbia CS9981 (1969).</ref> Perkins appeared with Cash on TV on the popular country series ''[[Hee Haw]]'', on February 16, 1974.\n\n[[Tommy Cash]] (brother of Johnny Cash) had a Top Ten country gospel hit in 1970, with a recording of the song \"Rise and Shine\", written by Perkins. It reached number 9 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and number 8 on the Canadian country chart. [[Arlene Harden]] had a Top 40 country hit in 1971 with the Perkins composition \"True Love Is Greater Than Friendship\", from the film ''[[Little Fauss and Big Halsy]]'' (1971). [[Al Martino]]'s cover of the song that same year reached number 22 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and number 33 on the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nAfter a long legal struggle with Sam Phillips over [[royalties]], Perkins gained ownership of his songs in the 1970s and, in 2003, his widow and then owner of the catalog entered into an administration contract with Paul McCartney's [[MPL Communications]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |author=Mike Kovacich |url=http://www.macca-central.com/macca-news/morenews.php?id=1157 |title=MACCA-News: McCartney to Administer Perkins's Music |publisher=Macca-central.com |date=April 17, 2003 |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-date=February 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213055837/http://www.macca-central.com/macca-news/morenews.php?id=1157 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Later years===\nThe rockabilly revival of the 1980s helped bring Perkins back into the limelight. In 1981 Perkins recorded the song \"Get It\" with [[Paul McCartney]], providing vocals and playing guitar with the former Beatle; according to one source, he fully co-wrote the song with McCartney.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 145.]]</ref> This recording was included on the chart-topping album ''[[Tug of War (Paul McCartney album)|Tug of War]]'', released in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpgr.co.uk/pctc259.html |title=Tug Of War |publisher=Jpgr.co.uk |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref>  During 1985, Perkins re-recorded \"Blue Suede Shoes\" with [[Lee Rocker]] and [[Slim Jim Phantom]] of the [[Stray Cats]], as part of the soundtrack for the film ''[[Porky's Revenge]]''.\n\nIn October 1985, Perkins was joined on stage in [[London]] for a television special, ''[[Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session]]'', by [[George Harrison]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Dave Edmunds]], Lee Rocker, [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. The show was taped live at the [[Limehouse Studios]]. It was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] on January 1, 1986. Perkins performed 16 songs, with two encores, in an extraordinary performance. He and his friends ended the session by singing \"Blue Suede Shoes\", his most famous song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears. The concert special was a highlight of his later career. It has been praised by fans for the spirited performances delivered by Perkins and his guests. The concert was released for DVD by Snapper Music in 2006.<ref>DVD ''Carl Perkins & Friends''. Released by Graham Nolder/Snapper Music. 2006. Cat:SDVD514</ref>\n\nPerkins was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1985. Wider recognition of his contribution to music came with his induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987. \"Blue Suede Shoes\" was chosen as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|\u201c500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\u201d]]. The song also received a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]]. Perkins was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his pioneering contribution to the genre.\n\nPerkins's only notable film performance as an actor was in [[John Landis]]'s 1985 film ''[[Into the Night (1985 film)|Into the Night]]''. The cameo-laden film includes a scene in which characters played by Perkins and [[David Bowie]] die by each other's hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089346/fullcredits#cast|title=Into the Night (1985): Full Cast & Crew|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nPerkins returned to the Sun Studio in Memphis in 1986, joining Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and [[Roy Orbison]] on the album ''[[Class of '55]]''. The record was a tribute to their early years at Sun and, specifically, the Million Dollar Quartet [[jam session]] involving Perkins, Presley, Cash, and Lewis in 1956.\n\nIn 1989, Perkins co-wrote and played guitar on [[the Judds]]' number 1 country hit, \"Let Me Tell You About Love\". Also in that year, he signed a record deal with Platinum Records for the album ''Friends, Family, and Legends'', featuring performances by [[Chet Atkins]], [[Travis Tritt]], [[Steve Wariner]], [[Joan Jett]] and [[Charlie Daniels]], along with [[Paul Shaffer]] and Will Lee. The song \"Wild Texas Wind\" became the title track to a made-for-TV [[Wild Texas Wind|movie]] featuring [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Gary Busey]]. In 1996 [[Willie Nelson]], who also appeared in that movie, would join Carl in a duett version of the song. During the production of this album, Perkins was diagnosed with [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]]. \nDolly Parton had a Top 20 Country hit in 1991 with the Perkins co-written [[Silver and Gold (Dolly Parton song)|\"Silver and Gold\"]].\n\n[[Mark O'Connor]] recorded a version of the Perkins classic [[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|\"Restless\"]] in 1991 and had a #25 Country hit with it in the US (#19 in Canada).\n\nHe again returned to Sun Studio to record with Scotty Moore, Presley's first guitar player, for the album ''706 ReUNION'', released by Belle Meade Records, which also featured [[D. J. Fontana]], Marcus Van Storey and [[the Jordanaires]]. In 1993, Perkins performed with the [[Kentucky Headhunters]] in a music video remake of his song \"Dixie Fried\", filmed in [[Glasgow, Kentucky]]. In 1994, he teamed up with [[Duane Eddy]] and [[the Mavericks]] to contribute \"Matchbox\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nHis last album, ''[[Go Cat Go!]]'', released by the independent label Dinosaur Records in 1996, features Perkins singing duets with [[Bono]], Johnny Cash, [[John Fogerty]], George Harrison, Paul McCartney, [[Willie Nelson]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Paul Simon]], and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/albums/go_cat_go.html |title=Carl Perkins/Various Artists: Go Cat Go! |publisher=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Carl Perkins|chart=all}} ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>\n\nHis last major concert performance was the [[Music for Montserrat]] all-star charity concert at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on September 15, 1997, four months before his death.\n\n==Personal life==\nA strong advocate for the prevention of child abuse, Perkins worked with the Jackson Exchange Club to establish the first center for the prevention of child abuse in Tennessee and the fourth in the nation. Proceeds from a concert planned by Perkins were combined with a grant from the [[National Exchange Club]] to establish the Prevention of Child Abuse in October 1981. For years its annual Circle of Hope Telethon generated one quarter of the center's annual operating budget.<ref>Tennessee Historical Commission</ref>\n\nPerkins had one daughter, Debbie, and three sons, Stan, Greg, and Steve.  Stan, Perkins' firstborn son, is also a recording artist. In 2010, he joined forces with [[Jerry Naylor]] to record a duet tribute, \"To Carl: Let It Vibrate\". Stan has been inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

Felts enjoyed modest pop success in 1960 with a remake of the Drifters' \"Honey Love\",<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which earned a low position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. He went on to release such songs as \"Lonely Teardrops\" and \"Pink And Black Days\", but he did not begin enjoying success on a national level as a country singer until the 1970s.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> His first major hit came in 1973, with a cover of Dobie Gray's \"[[Drift Away]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Felts' version \u2013 number eight on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in September 1973 \u2013 was midtempo country compared to Gray's blues version. The follow-up single, \"All in the Name of Love\", just missed hitting the top 10 in December 1973.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nFelts continued to enjoy modest success during the next year and a half, when he signed with [[ABC Records|ABC-Dot Records]] in 1975.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> That year, he enjoyed his biggest hit, a cover of [[Johnny Adams]]' soul classic \"Reconsider Me\",<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which showcased his falsetto and high tenor.

Reed's grandparents lived in [[Rockmart, Georgia|Rockmart]] and he would visit them from time to time. As a small child running around strumming his guitar he is quoted as saying \"I am gonna be a star. I'm gonna go to [[Nashville]] and be a star.\" Reed's parents separated four months after his birth; he and his sister spent seven years in [[foster home]]s or [[orphanage]]s growing up. Reed was reunited with his mother and stepfather in 1944.\n\nReed graduated from O'Keefe High School, an Atlanta city school. The O'Keefe building still exists today; it was sold to [[Georgia Tech]] and is now part of the university's campus. By high school, Reed was already writing and singing music, having learned to play the guitar as a child. At age 18, he was signed by publisher and record producer [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] to cut his first record, \"[[If the Good Lord's Willing and the Creek Don't Rise]]\".\n\nAt [[Capitol Records]] Reed was promoted as a new \"teen-age sensation\" after recording his own [[rockabilly]] composition \"When I Found You\" in 1956. He recorded both country and rockabilly singles and found success as a songwriter when label mate [[Gene Vincent]] covered his song \"Crazy Legs\" in 1958.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nBy 1958, [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] signed Reed to his company, [[National Recording Corporation]]. He recorded for NRC as both an artist and as a member of the staff band which included [[Joe South]] and [[Ray Stevens]], other NRC artists.\n\nReed married [[Priscilla Mitchell|Priscilla \"Prissy\" Mitchell]] in 1959. They had two daughters, Seidina Ann Hubbard, born April 2, 1960, and Charlotte Elaine (Lottie) Zavala, born October 19, 1970. Mitchell was a member of folk group The Appalachians (\"Bony Moronie\", 1963), and with [[Roy Drusky]] was co-credited on the 1965 country No. 1 \"[[Yes, Mr. Peters]]\".\n\n==Career==\nIn 1959, Reed hit the Billboard \"Bubbling Under the Top 100\", also known as the Roar and Cashbox Country chart with the single \"Soldier's Joy\". After serving two years in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], Reed moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1961 to continue his songwriting career, which had continued to gather steam while he was in the Army, thanks to [[Brenda Lee]]'s 1960 cover of his song \"That's All You Got to Do\".<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> He also became a popular session and tour guitarist.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> In 1962, he scored some success with two singles \"[[Goodnight Irene]]\" (as by Jerry Reed & the Hully Girlies, featuring a female vocal group) and \"Hully Gully Guitar\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> which found their way to [[Chet Atkins]] at [[RCA Victor]], who produced Reed's 1965 \"If I Don't Live Up to It\".\n\n===\"Guitar Man\"===\nIn July 1967, Reed had his best showing on the country chart (No. 53) with his self-penned \"[[Guitar Man (Jerry Reed song)|Guitar Man]]\", which [[Elvis Presley]] soon covered.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Reed's next single was \"Tupelo Mississippi Flash\", a comic tribute to Presley. Recorded on September 1, the song became his first [[Top 20]] hit, going to No. 15 on the chart. Coincidentally Presley came to Nashville to record nine days later on September 10, 1967, and one of the songs he became especially excited about was \"Guitar Man\".\n\nReed recalled how he was tracked down to play on the Presley session: \"I was out on the [[Cumberland River]] fishing, and I got a call from [[Felton Jarvis]] (then Presley's producer at [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]) He said, 'Elvis is down here. We've been trying to cut \"Guitar Man\" all day long. He wants it to sound like it sounded on your album.' I finally told him, 'Well, if you want it to sound like that, you're going have to get me in there to play guitar, because these guys [you're using in the studio] are [[Flatpicking|straight pickers]]. I [[fingerpicking|pick with my fingers]] and tune that guitar up all weird kind of ways.'\"<ref name=\"tennessean\">{{cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080902/TUNEIN/80902039|title='Bandit' star Reed dies at 71|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|date=September 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nJarvis hired Reed to play on the session. \"I hit that intro, and [Elvis's] face lit up and here we went. Then after he got through that, he cut [my] \"[[U.S. Male]]\" at the same session. I was toppin' cotton, son.\" Reed also played the guitar for Elvis Presley's [[Big Boss Man (song)|\"Big Boss Man\"]] (1967), recorded in the same session.<ref>Ernst Jorgensen, ''Elvis Presley: A Life in Music'' (St. Martin's Press, 1998), pp. 234\u2013236</ref>\n\nOn January 15 and 16, 1968, Reed worked on a second Presley session, during which he played guitar on a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Too Much Monkey Business]]\", \"Stay Away\", and \"Goin' Home\" (two songs revolving around Presley's film ''[[Stay Away, Joe]]''), as well as another Reed composition, \"U.S. Male\" (Reed's quoted recollection of \"U.S. Male\" being recorded at the same session as \"Guitar Man\" being incorrect).<ref>Jorgensen, pp. 241\u2013242</ref>\n\nPresley also recorded two other Reed compositions: \"[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]\" in May 1971 for his [[He Touched Me (Elvis Presley album)|''He Touched Me'']] album, and \"Talk About The Good Times\" in December 1973, for a total of four.\n\n[[Johnny Cash]] also released \"[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]\" as a single in 1971.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> It  reached No. 2 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Country Singles Chart for North America and was also successful in Europe. It became the title track for a studio [[A Thing Called Love|album]] that he released the following spring.\n\n===1970s===\nAfter releasing the 1970 crossover hit \"[[Amos Moses]]\", a hybrid of rock, country, funk, and Cajun styles which reached No. 8 on the U.S. pop chart,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Reed teamed with Atkins for the duet LP ''[[Me & Jerry]]'', which earned the pair the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]]. During the 1970 television season, he was a regular on ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', and in 1971 he released his biggest hit, the chart-topper \"[[When You're Hot, You're Hot]]\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>KO buddy of the singer, who nevertheless sends him up the river for gambling. Aside from being a major crossover hit, \"When You're Hot, You're Hot\" earned Reed the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male]].\n\n\"When You're Hot, You're Hot\" was the title track of Reed's first solo album, reaching No. 9 Pop and No. 6 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart.

A year later he scored his second number one single with \"Lord, Mr. Ford\" (written by [[Deena Kaye Rose]]), from the album of the same name.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nAtkins, who frequently produced Reed's music, remarked that he had to encourage Reed to put instrumental numbers on his own albums, as Reed always considered himself more of a songwriter than a player. Atkins, however, thought Reed was a better [[fingerstyle]] player than he was himself; Reed, according to Atkins, helped him work out the fingerpicking for one of Atkins's biggest hits, \"[[Yakety Sax]]\".\n\nReed was featured in animated form in a December 9, 1972, episode of [[Hanna\u2013Barbera]]'s ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', \"The Phantom of the Country Music Hall\" (prod.

In one memorable appearance, Reed caught a particularly big [[largemouth bass]] and planned to have it preserved and mounted by a [[taxidermist]].

In 1984, \"The Best Of Families\" became a Top 50 hit; That same year, Downing released his final hit with the Team label, \"There\u2019ll Never Be A Better Night For Being Wrong\".\n\n===Vine Street years===\nIn 1987, Downing was signed by the [[Vine Street]] label, which released the \"Oh How Beautiful You Are\" (To Me) and \"Just One Night Won't Do,\" both of which hit the Top 70. Two years later, he was signed by Door Knob Records, with whom he produced the 1989 Top 100 hit, \"I Guess By Now.\"\n\nThe popular entertainer [[Fats Domino]] recorded two songs written by Downing: \"Mary, Oh Mary\" and \"Heartbreak Hill\". [[Bobby Bland|Bobby \"Blue\" Bland]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] have also recorded Downing's songs.\n\n===Later career===\nDowning built a five-decade career around his powerful singing voice and his hard-driving rockabilly-style piano. Downing's compilations of earlier work have been released throughout the world. In Europe, Crazy Music obtained exclusive rights for the original Team label recordings and released these in the form of a 2-CD compilation, ''Classic Collection''. This also contained some of Downing's earlier hits, including \"Mr. Jones.\"\n\nIn July 2002, he played the Oneida Casino's Rock'n'Roll Festival in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] with dozens of other rockabilly musicians.\n\nIn 2003, Downing released his first new album in more than a decade, ''One of A Kind''. The album received favourable radio and print reviews. It ranked third on ''American Roots Country'' and was commended for featuring 14 memorable tracks. He continued to give regular performances at the Grand Ole Opry. In 2000, he was nominated as a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.\n\nDowning continued to perform on more than 75 occasions per year in the remaining years of his life. He appeared at [[Ontario]]'s [[Havelock Country Jamboree]] with [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Roy Clark]]. In 2005, Downing postponed plans for a European tour that was set to begin on July 1 in Austria. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic [[leukemia]]. Soon after, he commenced [[chemotherapy]] treatment. Downing died on July 4, 2005.\n\n==Style==\nDowning's musical style found its roots in a variety of musical styles including [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], roots, [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[country music|country]]. He performed [[rhythm and blues]] and [[disco]] throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when he lived in [[Washington, D.C.]]  He eventually reclaimed his musical roots by turning to country music.\n\n== Producer ==\nIn additional to his work as a recording artist and performer, Downing also worked as a music producer. During late 1990s and early 2000s, he worked with several European musicians as an [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) agent. In 2003, he produced the album, ''Straight Beat'', with the Italian bluesman Edo 'Ndoss, which included songs written by Downing that he had not recorded himself. Downing's piano work on this album represented his last recording.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Album\n! <small>[[Top Country Albums|US Country]]</small>\n!

She was one of the few women working in the male-dominated rock and roll music field during the 1950s and one of country music's early female innovators. Martin was nicknamed the Female Elvis for her dance moves on stage, similar to those of [[Elvis Presley]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{More citations needed |date=June 2018}}\n\n===Early life and rise to fame===\nMartin was born in [[Sutherlin, Virginia]], east of [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]]. Her mother was a stage mother, and her father and uncle were both musicians. Before she was six, Martin was already singing and playing the guitar, inspired by [[Eddy Arnold]] and [[Hank Williams]]. \nOver the years, this resulted in statewide contests with over 200 contestants, which she won. As a result, Janis was asked to play on the same bill as [[Cowboy Copas]] and [[Sunshine Sue]].  Through them Martin became a member of the [[Old Dominion Barn Dance|Old Dominion Barndance]] on [[WRVA (AM)|WRVA]], which came out of Richmond every Saturday Night on CBS network. When she was in her mid-teens, she was appearing with country singers including Arnold, [[Hank Snow]], [[The Browns]] and [[Jim Reeves]].  She soon claimed she was tired of country music and began a rock and roll career.\n\n===Teen rock and roll star===\nThe WRVA station announcer, Carl Stutz, wrote a song titled \"Will You Willyum\", and asked Martin to sing the song live on stage that Saturday night so that he could make a demo tape to send to his publisher in New York. A week later, Stutz called Martin to tell her that [[RCA Victor]] was interested in recording \"Will You Willyum\". As it happened, the publisher offered \"Will You Willyum\" to [[Steve Sholes]], a producer at RCA Victor, and asked whether Sholes had an artist to record it. Apparently Sholes replied \"Well, who's the girl doin' the demo?\"\n\nAt age 15, Martin signed with RCA Victor in March 1956, just two months after Elvis Presley joined the label. She recorded \"Will You Willyum\" on March 8, 1956, backed by her own composition \"Drugstore Rock 'n Roll\".\n\nThe song became the biggest hit of her career, selling 750,000 records. Soon Martin was performing on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen]]''. She also appeared on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Jubilee USA]]'', and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in Nashville, Tennessee, becoming one of the younger performers to ever appear. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her Most Promising Female Vocalist that year.\n\nPresley and RCA were so impressed with Martin's stage presence that they dubbed her the Female Elvis.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=April 7, 1956 |title=Review spotlight on... |pages=44 |magazine=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZB8EAAAAMBAJ&dq=janis+martin+female+elvis&pg=PA44 |access-date=March 29, 2022}}</ref><ref>[[Sun Records]] also dubbed [[Jean Chapel]] the female Elvis Presley in 1956 when she began recording rockabilly songs including \"I Won't Be Rocking Tonight\".</ref> Presley sent a dozen red roses to her when she appeared at the RCA Victor convention in [[Miami, Florida]]. [[Colonel Tom Parker]], Elvis' manager, offered to take over her management seeing the potential of a successful double \"boy-girl\" bill. Just before, due to his extremely taxing touring schedule, Elvis had collapsed on stage in New York due to exhaustion. Safeguarding the young Janis Martin from this, her parents decided to not accept Parker's offer, and instead go with the head of the Old Dominion shows. RCA chose Martin to tour as a member of the [[Jim Reeves]] show and continued recording rock and roll and country material that ended up being successful on both charts, including \"My Boy Elvis\", \"Let's Elope Baby\", her cover of [[Roy Orbison]]'s song \"[[Ooby Dooby]]\", and \"[[Love Me to Pieces]]\".\n\nOn January 7, 1956, Martin eloped with her boyfriend, a paratrooper. She told her parents of her marriage only after her husband was safely shipped overseas in Germany. Her father tried to have it annulled because she was only 15 years old. Eventually, the matter was left, but Janis' mother ordered her to keep her marriage a secret to safeguard her career. In 1957, Janis went on a [[USO]] tour in Europe with [[Jim Reeves]], [[Del Wood]] (a pianist famous for performing the song \"Down Yonder\"), [[The Browns]], and [[Hank Locklin]]. Her husband got a 30-day leave and went on the road with her, which resulted in her getting pregnant with her son. Martin's teenage pregnancy caused RCA Victor to drop her in 1958. It was probably during this period that a 10\" LP album titled ''Janis and Elvis'' was released in South Africa. This was recalled immediately upon request from the U.S. because it suggested the idea that the two performers were singing together. Although [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] and [[Decca Records]] were interested, she signed with the Belgian label [[Palette Records|Palette]] in 1960.\n\n===Later career===\nBy 1960, Martin was on her second marriage, and her husband demanded she leave the music business. In the 1970s, she began performing again with her newly formed band, The Variations. In 1975, she was working for the [[Halifax, Virginia]], Police Department when music historian Dennis West tracked her down. Edd Bayes, a record collector from Maryland, asked Dennis for her address, which Dennis gave to him. He then coaxed her to appear locally and tell her story in ''Goldmine'' magazine. Martin toured through Europe as part of the rockabilly revival there, and in 1979 Bayes convinced RCA to pull four Martin songs from their vault, which were then released on [[Dog Gone Records]] in 1977. Edd Bayes took one of the songs that had been recorded twice (\"Love Me Love\") at different tempos and added the 'cha cha' to the title. In the 1980s, the [[Bear Family]] label gathered Martin's complete record history with the compilation album ''The Female Elvis''. Since the early 1980s Janis started performing again at Rockabilly shows through Europe and the US. One of her live shows was released on a CD called ''Here I Am'' on [[Hydra Records]].  In 1995, Martin appeared on [[Rosie Flores]]'s ''Rockabilly Filly'' album for [[HighTone Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockabilly Filly Overview|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rockabilly-filly-mw0000177263|website=AllMusic.com|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Flores recorded an album with Martin six months before her death, but it was not released until September 18, 2012, as [[The Blanco Sessions]] by [[Cow Island Music]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Janis Martin, 'The Female Elvis,' Returns|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/30/161968431/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-returns|website=NPR Music|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Flores|first1=Rosie|title=JANIS MARTIN \" The Female Elvis\", Final Recording Sessions|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1383637978/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-final-recording-sess|website=Kickstarter|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nMartin died from cancer on September 3, 2007, at [[Duke University Medical Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].

His 1956 top ten hit with his backing band [[the Blue Caps]], \"[[Be-Bop-a-Lula]]\", is considered a significant early example of rockabilly.<ref name=pc8/> His chart career was brief, especially in his home country of the US, where he notched three top 40 hits in 1956 and 1957, and never charted in the top 100 again.  In the UK, he was a somewhat bigger star, racking up eight top 40 hits from 1956 to 1961.\n\nVincent was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He is sometimes referred to by his somewhat unusual nickname/moniker the \"Screaming End\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-12 |title=Gene Vincent: The hero before The Beatles |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/gene-vincent-heror-the-beatles/ |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|title=GENE VINCENT|first=Ian|last=Chaddock|website=Vivelerock.net|access-date=May 22, 2021|archive-date=December 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211228151827/https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nCraddock was born February 11, 1935, in [[Norfolk, Virginia]],<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |date=1997 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=1-85227-745-9 |editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |edition=Concise |page=1218}}</ref> to Mary Louise and Ezekiah Jackson Craddock.<ref name=\"musicianguide.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000576/Gene-Vincent.html|title=Gene Vincent Biography|website=Musicianguide.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref>  His musical influences included [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. His favorite composition was [[Egmont (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Egmont overture]]. He showed his first real interest in music while his family lived in Munden Point (now [[Virginia Beach]]), in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]], Virginia, near the [[North Carolina]] line, where they ran a country store. He received his first guitar at the age of twelve as a gift from a friend.\n\nCraddock's father volunteered to serve in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and patrolled American coastal waters to protect Allied shipping against German [[U-boat]]s during [[World War II]]. Craddock's mother maintained the general store in Munden Point. His parents moved the family to Norfolk, the home of a large naval base, and opened a general store and sailors' tailoring shop.\n\nCraddock dropped out of school in 1952, at the age of seventeen, and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]]. As he was under the age of enlistment, his parents signed the forms allowing him to enter. He completed boot camp and joined the fleet as a crewman aboard the fleet oiler {{USS|Chukawan|AO-100|6}}, with a two-week training period in the repair ship {{USS|Amphion|AR-13|6}}, before returning to the ''Chukawan''. He never saw combat but completed a [[Korean War]] deployment. He sailed home from Korean waters aboard the battleship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|6}} but was not part of the ship's company.\n\nCraddock planned a career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] motorcycle. On July 4, 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was shattered in an auto crash.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henderson|first=Derek|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70671058|title=Gene Vincent: a companion|year=2005|publisher=Spent Brothers Productions|isbn=0-9519416-7-4|location=Southampton|page=3|oclc=70671058}}</ref> He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him with a limp and pain.

His best known record was \"Ten Long Fingers\", recorded in 1958.\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Dallas, Texas]], he was encouraged to be an entertainer as a child.  He initially learned the [[steel guitar]],<ref name=Morrison>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qAHvUO5GknMC&dq=%22joe+poovey%22&pg=PA158  Craig Morrison, ''Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly music and its makers'', University of Illinois Press, 1996, p.158]</ref> and made his first recordings at the age of 10.  Two years later, in 1953, he formed a group, the Hillbilly Boys, and started weekly broadcasts on radio station [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], soon followed by work as a disc jockey on the \"[[Big D Jamboree]]\" radio show. He also recorded several Christmas-themed songs, including \"Santa's Helper\", written by his father Bernice Poovey.  After opening a show for [[Elvis Presley]] in 1955, he instantly changed his musical style from traditional country music to rockabilly.  In 1957, as '''Jumping Joe Poovey''', he recorded \"Move Around\" on the [[Dixie Records|Dixie]] label, produced by Jim Shell in Dallas.  It was followed the next year by \"Ten Long Fingers\", a tribute to [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], on which he was credited as \"Groove Joe Poovey\" {{sic}}.   Although the record was later acclaimed as a classic rockabilly number, featuring piano by local prodigy C.B. Oliver, it was only locally successful, and Poovey remained working in the Dallas and [[Fort Worth]] area, recording occasionally for small local labels.<ref name=hall>[http://rockabillyhall.com/JoePoovey1.html  Groovey Joe Poovey at the Rockabilly Hall of Fame]</ref><ref name=tsha>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpo69  The Handbook of Texas Online: Groovey Joe Poovey]</ref><ref name=blackcat>[http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/groovey_joe_poovey.htm  Groovey Joe Poovey at Black Cat Rockabilly]</ref><ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-poovey-p366176/biography  Biography by Jason Ankeny at Allmusic.com]</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s he returned to playing country music and worked as a songwriter, his songs being recorded by such musicians as [[George Jones]] and [[Johnny Paycheck]].  In 1966, using the pseudonym '''Johnny Dallas''', he recorded \"Heart Full of Love\", which reached no. 62 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]].  However, follow-ups failed to match its success, and he retired from performing to concentrate on his work as a disc jockey, working on various radio stations in the Dallas \u2013 Fort Worth area.  In the 1970s, his earlier records began to be recognised by rockabilly fans in Europe, where he first performed in 1980, and unreleased recordings from the 1950s were made available.  He also began recording again, releasing several new singles under the name '''Texas Joe Poovey'''.  At the same time, he worked as a chauffeur on the film set of the ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' TV series.<ref name=hall/><ref name=tsha/><ref name=blackcat/><ref name=allmusic/>\n\nHe continued to make regular visits to Britain and Europe, performing both country and rockabilly music, into the 1990s.  Shortly before the release of a retrospective album, ''Golden Grooves'', he died at the age of 57 from a heart condition.<ref name=hall/><ref name=tsha/><ref name=blackcat/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artist.php?key=poov1000  Discography]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Poovey, Joe}}\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:American country singers]]\n[[Category:American country songwriters]]\n[[Category:American rockabilly musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Dallas]]\n[[Category:Radio personalities from Dallas]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]\n[[Category:20th-century American musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

In 1957, the band signed with [[Imperial Records]], where they recorded \"All Night Long\" (b/w \"Red Cadillac and a Black Mustache\") and \"Amarillo Blues.\"<ref name=TSHA/>\n\nThat same year, the band appeared on the ''[[Town Hall Party]]'' in Los Angeles, and appeared in the movie ''[[Carnival Rock]]'', where they backed up [[David Houston (singer)|David Houston]].<ref name=TSHA/>\n\nThe following year, having been dropped by Imperial Records, Luman signed with [[Capitol Records]],<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> where he released \"Try Me\" and \"I Know My Baby Cares.\"  Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name, which he refused to do, so he left the record label and signed with [[Warner Bros.

He is best known for having hosted ''[[Hee Haw]]'', a nationally televised country variety show, from 1969 to 1997. Clark was an important and influential figure in [[country music]], both as a performer and in helping to popularize the genre.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Clark frequently guest-hosted for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and enjoyed a 30-million viewership for ''Hee Haw''. Clark was highly regarded and renowned as a guitarist, [[banjo]] player, and [[fiddle]]r.  He was skilled in the traditions of many genres, including classical guitar, country music, [[Latin music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and pop.  He had hit songs as a pop vocalist (e.g., \"[[Hier encore|Yesterday, When I Was Young]]\" and \"Thank God and Greyhound\"), and his instrumental skill had an enormous effect on generations of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and country musicians. He became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1987, and, in 2009, was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]]. He published his autobiography, ''My Life\u2014in Spite of Myself'', in 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-671-86434-7 |title=Nonfiction Book Review: 'My Life in Spite of Myself' |date=February 28, 1994 |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nClark was born April 15, 1933, in [[Meherrin, Virginia]],{{sfn|''Current Biography Yearbook''|1979|page=83}} one of five children<ref name=Thanki>{{cite news| url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/11/15/roy-clark-dead-85/1978910002/| title=Roy Clark, 'Hee Haw' co-host, Country Music Hall of Fame member, dies at 85| last=Thanki| first=Juli| newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]| location=Nashville| access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref> born to Hester Linwood Clark and Lillian Clark (Oliver).{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} His father was a tobacco farmer.{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} He spent his childhood in Meherrin and New York City, where his father moved the family to take jobs during the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} When Clark was 11 years old, his family moved to a home on 1st Street SE in the [[Washington Highlands, Washington, D.C.|Washington Highlands]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.,{{sfn|Clark|Eliot|1994|page=84}} after his father found work at the [[Washington Navy Yard]].{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}}\n\nClark's father was a semi-professional musician who played [[banjo]], [[violin|fiddle]], and guitar,{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} and his mother played piano.{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} The first musical instrument Clark ever played was a four-string cigar box with a ukulele neck attached to it,{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} which he picked up in elementary school.<ref name=rcinterview>{{cite magazine| title=The Roy Clark Interview| magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date=December 28, 1985| pages=RC-4, RC-12| access-date=November 15, 2018| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Roy%20Clark%22%20%22National%20Banjo%20Championship%22&pg=PT77}}</ref> His father taught Clark to play guitar{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} when Roy was 14 years old, and soon Clark was playing banjo, guitar, and [[mandolin]].{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}} \"Guitar was my real love, though,\" Clark later said. \"I never copied anyone, but I was certainly influenced by them; especially by [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]].

[[Country-western]] music was widely derided by Clark's schoolmates, leaving him socially isolated. Clowning around, he felt, helped him to fit in again. Clark used humor as a musician as well, and it was not until the mid 1960s that he felt confident enough to perform in public without using humor in his act.<ref name=rcinterview />\n\nThe D.C. area had a number of country-western music venues at the time.

By all accounts the singer was not held in much regard by Phillips, but Feathers often made the audacious claim that he had arranged \"[[That's All Right]]\" and \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\" for [[Elvis Presley]]. He also claimed that his \"We're Getting Closer (To Being Apart)\" had been intended to be Elvis' sixth single for Sun.

When his King contract ran out he still continued to perform, although Feathers thought there was a conspiracy to keep his music from gaining the popularity it deserved.<ref name=bc/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he performed at times at new music nightclubs like the Antenna Club in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], sharing the bill with [[rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] bands like [[Tav Falco's Panther Burns]], who, as devoted fans of Feathers, had introduced him to their label's president.<ref name= \"Panther\">{{cite news |last=Sprague |first=David |url= https://variety.com/2001/music/reviews/panther-burns-1200467792/ |title=Panther Burns |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 17, 2001 |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe released his ''New Jungle Fever'' album in 1987 and ''Honkey Tonk Man'' in 1988, featuring the lead guitar work of his son, Bubba Feathers.

Since the 1950s, she has recorded and released music in the genres of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. She was among the first women to have a career in rock and roll, recording a series of 1950s singles that helped give her the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]] \"The Queen of Rockabilly\". She is also counted among the first female stars in the genre of country music.\n\nJackson began performing as a child and later had her own radio show in Oklahoma City. She was then discovered by country singer [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], who helped her secure a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] in 1954. At Decca, Jackson had her first hit single with the country song \"[[You Can't Have My Love]]\". She then began touring the following year with [[Elvis Presley]]. The two briefly dated and Presley encouraged her to record in the [[Rockabilly]] style. In 1956, Jackson signed with [[Capitol Records]] where she was given full permission to record both country and Rockabilly. The label released a string of Jackson's rock  singles, including \"[[Fujiyama Mama]]\", \"Mean Mean Man\" and the top 40 hit \"[[Let's Have a Party]]\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Jackson moved back to the country genre and had several charting singles during the decade. This included \"[[Right or Wrong (Wanda Jackson song)|Right or Wrong]]\", \"[[In the Middle of a Heartache]]\", \"[[Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine]]\" and \"[[A Woman Lives for Love]]\". In addition, she also recorded several selections for the German language market overseas. In 1965, the German single \"[[Santo Domingo (song)|Santo Domingo]]\" reached number one on the Austrian pop chart. After re-discovering [[Christianity]] in 1971, Jackson made [[gospel music]] a priority in her career. She left Capitol Records in 1973 and signed with [[Word Records]] to focus more on the gospel circuit. Over the next two decades, she released a series of gospel discs.\n\nIn 1984, Jackson was sought out by European promoters to tour overseas. The same year, she released her first rock album in two decades and launched a new career in the genre. In the 1990s, her rock records were noticed again by American audiences and she began touring alongside fellow Rockabilly artist [[Rosie Flores]]. During this period, she released several commercially acclaimed albums in the rock and roll style, including ''[[Heart Trouble (album)|Heart Trouble]]'' (2003) and ''[[I Remember Elvis]]'' (2006). Following her 2009 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Jackson collaborated with musician [[Jack White]] to record the commercially successful ''[[The Party Ain't Over]]''. For several years, she kept a busy touring schedule before announcing her retirement from performing in 2019. She released her 32nd and final studio project, ''[[Encore (2021 Wanda Jackson album)|Encore]]'', in 2021.\n\n==Early life==\nJackson was the only child born to parents Tom and Nellie Jackson in [[Maud, Oklahoma]].<ref name=\"Oklahoma\">{{cite web |last1=Carney |first1=George O. |title=Jackson, Wanda LaVonne: The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |website=Oklahoma History.org |access-date=9 July 2021 |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184947/https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |url-status=live }}</ref> Her father worked multiple jobs, including a gas station attendant and delivery truck driver.

Nellie Jackson often had Jackson sing while she was out of sight, to ensure her daughter was accounted for.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=6-8}} In Los Angeles, Jackson was introduced to [[western swing]] music.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She enjoyed hearing music by popular western acts like [[Bob Wills]] and [[Rose Maddox]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=8-10}} At age six, her father introduced Jackson to the guitar. She also took guitar lessons and was soon skillful enough to play it alongside her father.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}\n\nIn the mid 1940s, the family relocated to [[Bakersfield, California]] where Tom Jackson took a job as a [[barber]]. She also took piano lessons and continued to play the guitar.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}} It was during this period that she began having trouble with academics. Jackson recalled the experience in her book: \"All I wanted to do was sing and play music, and it was impossible for me to sit still,\" she recounted in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=15}} When Jackson was nine, the family moved back to their home state, this time living in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Her father found employment as a taxi cab driver and her mother worked on an air force base.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}}\n\nIn Oklahoma City, Jackson sang in the local Baptist church and engaged in more performance opportunities.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She auditioned for the local radio station, KPLR, after being peer-pressured by friends.

On Thompson's show, Jackson sang \"Blue Yodel No. 6\" backed by his band the Brazos Valley Boys. The performance led to a regular gig singing alongside [[Merl Lindsay]]'s country band.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=40-44}} Jackson was always performing, and at times neglected her social life. \"[Wanda] never had time for dates, nothing like that. Just that guitar \u2013 that's all she thought about,\" a high school friend recalled.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}\n\n==Career==\n===1953\u20131955: Country beginnings===\nJackson also continued working with Hank Thompson. In 1953, she appeared with him regularly on his local television program and on a similar program for 30 minutes hosted by KPLR. Thompson also recorded Jackson on several demonstration recordings in hopes they would be heard by major record labels. Thompson was also attempting to get his band member Billy Gray a recording contract, and had the pair sing several duets.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} Jackson was supposed to be signed by Thompson's label, [[Capitol Records]], but was rejected by producer [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. \"Girls don't sell records!\" he told Thompson.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}} In her book, Jackson recalled hearing Nelson's statement: \"I recognize that Ken wasn't being sexist, so much as he was thinking about business. But it still gave me a little nudge to prove him wrong!\"{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59}}\n\n[[File:Wanda Jackson--1956.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jackson was known for her spaghetti strap dresses, designed by her mother.]]\nInstead Thompson contacted [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]] of [[Decca Records]], who was interested in signing Jackson and Billy Gray.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} In 1954, while still high school, Jackson signed with the label.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201-202}} In March 1954, the Jackson family traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] where she recorded her first Decca sessions backed by Thompson's band. She cut several solo sides, along with the Billy Gray duet, \"[[You Can't Have My Love]]\". Jackson disliked the song, but Thompson convinced her to record it.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=60-62}} It was soon released as Jackson's debut single on Decca and became a major hit, climbing to the number eight spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Upon Decca's encouragement, Jackson and Gray recorded a second duet, titled \"If You Don't Somebody Else Will\". Released as a single, the song was a commercial failure due to a competing version by [[Jimmy & Johnny]] that reached the charts.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\" />{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=64}}\n\nInstead of touring, Jackson started her senior year in fall 1954 and finished high school. She was part of the school band and acted in the musical ''[[Anything Goes]]''.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=66-68}} In March 1955, she returned to the recording studio, this time working with Paul Cohen at the Decca studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

He sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|title= Johnny Cash Biography and Interview |website=Achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/johnny-cash/#interview}}</ref> He auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music. Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to \"go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell\". In a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786|title=The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues|newspaper=NPR|access-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, \"[[Hey Porter]]\" and \"[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]\", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.\n\nCash's next record, \"Folsom Prison Blues\", made the country top five. His \"[[I Walk the Line]]\" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. \"[[Home of the Blues]]\" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Cash felt that Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.\n\nIn 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]]. His single \"[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]\" became one of his biggest hits. He recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind such a backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]]\", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.{{Efn|When [[RCA Victor]] signed Presley, it had also bought his Sun Records masters, but when Cash departed for Columbia, Phillips retained the rights to the singer's Sun masters. Columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after Cash's death.}}\n[[File:Johnny Cash - Cash Box 1957.jpg|thumb|Cash on the cover of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' magazine, September 7, 1957]]\nEarly in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname \"the Undertaker\" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes.

June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short-lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html|title=Rainbow Quest|website=Richardandmimi.com|date=February 26, 1966|access-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]''. It was later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.\n\nCash's career was handled by [[Saul Holiff]], a [[London, Ontario]], promoter.

For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash would use the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]].\n\nAlthough he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity.

Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, he was held only one night each time. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers.

His ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964) was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. \n\nIn 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965) was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.\n\nReaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash and his first wife divorced after having separated in 1962. Some venues cancelled his performances, but he continued to find success.

Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. He was jailed for the night in [[LaFayette, Georgia]]. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation|page=5A|place=LaFayette, Georgia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621|newspaper=Rome News Tribune|date=August 14, 1970|title=12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref> \n\nReflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: \"I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me.\"<ref>Gross (2004). p. 34</ref> June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs.

In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]], making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled ''Highwayman'' in 1985, followed by ''Highwaymen 2'' in 1990, and concluding with ''Highwaymen&nbsp;\u2013 The Road Goes On Forever'' in 1995.\n\nDuring that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County (film)|Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life [[Murder in Coweta County|Georgia murder]] case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis.\n\nCash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an [[ostrich]] on his farm.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|title=Johnny Cash: The Rebel|website=Exclaim.ca|place=Canada|page=3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426225724/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|archive-date=April 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nAt a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a \"[[near-death experience]]\".\n\n{{Anchor|Chicken in Black}}\nIn 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled \"[[The Chicken in Black]]\" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book ''Johnny Cash: The Life'', disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash \u2013 who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as \"A Boy Named Sue\" and \"One Piece at a Time\" \u2013 accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked \"like a buffoon\" in the music video (which was showcased during Cash's 1984 Christmas TV special), and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from stores\u2014interrupting its bona fide chart success\u2014and termed the venture \"a fiasco\".<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''.

During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]'', a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[John Carter Cash]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]]. A [[Johnny Cash Country Christmas|one-off Christmas album]] recorded for [[Delta Records]] followed his Mercury contract.\n\nThough Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death, his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians [[Marc Riley]] (formerly of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and [[Jon Langford]] ([[the Mekons]]) put together '''Til Things Are Brighter'', a [[tribute album]] featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a \"morale booster\"; Rosanne Cash later said \"he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it\".

He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park. His drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement.

When asked why most of his songs were positive in their outlook, McDaniel told the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'' that \"there's enough things in the world to keep you bummed out\" and that his fans did not want to \"hear me singing something that's gonna bum 'em out some more.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tIIgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R8AEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2818,1429291&dq=mel+mcdaniel+real+good+feel+good+song&hl=en|title=Good Ol' Boy|last=Perala|first=Andrew|date=October 19, 1989|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|access-date=June 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMcDaniel was born in [[Checotah, Oklahoma]],<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=249}}</ref> a small town in [[McIntosh County, Oklahoma]], and grew up in [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma]]. He was inspired to play music after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] on television. His first interest in music was when he learned the trumpet in the fourth grade, but he soon learned the guitar.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> At age 14, he taught himself the guitar chords to \"[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie and Johnny]]\" and performed at a high-school talent contest. He made his professional debut at age 15 performing in a talent contest at Okmulgee High School. While in high school, he played in several local bands, and after graduation, began working as a musician in [[Tulsa]] clubs. While in Tulsa, he recorded several singles for local label [[J.J. Cale]] and wrote and produced his first single, \"Lazy Me\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===Career===\nAfter marrying his high school sweetheart, McDaniel began performing in Tulsa. From there, he had an unsuccessful trip to Nashville, followed by quite a bit of success in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], performing at clubs among the oil fields.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> After two years there, he returned to Nashville and landed a job as a demo singer and songwriter with Combine Music. With the help of music publisher [[Bob Beckham]], McDaniel signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1976 and released his first single, \"Have a Dream on Me\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nHis career finally took off with \"[[Louisiana Saturday Night]]\" in 1981, and in early 1985 he scored his only number one hit with \"[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Other Top 10 hits include \"[[Right in the Palm of Your Hand]]\" (later covered by [[Alan Jackson]] in 1999), \"[[Take Me to the Country (song)|Take Me to the Country]]\", \"[[Big Ole Brew]]\", \"[[I Call It Love (Mel McDaniel song)|I Call It Love]]\", and \"[[Real Good Feel Good Song]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nMcDaniel became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on January 11, 1986, and made frequent appearances on the show.\n\nMcDaniel was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]] in 2006, along with induction classmate [[Leon Russell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oklahomamusichalloffame.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/17/Default.aspx |title=By Year |access-date=April 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429194034/http://www.oklahomamusichalloffame.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/17/Default.aspx |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Later years, health, and death===\nOn November 14, 1996, he had a nearly fatal fall into an orchestra pit while he was performing at the Heymann Performing Arts Center in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].

In 1946 his family moved to [[Dallas]], where he played on [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]]'s ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. By 1951 he was playing on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''; that year he signed to [[Capitol Records]] and released his first single, \"I Keep the Blues All the Time\", as Jimmy Lee. Capitol released seven further singles from Fautheree before dropping him in 1952. Despite never charting, the recordings have been cited as influential on later rockabilly artists, including [[James Burton]].\n\nFautheree subsequently found work as a [[session musician]] for musicians such as [[Faron Young]] and [[Webb Pierce]]. Along with [[\"Country\" Johnny Mathis]], he performed on ''Louisiana Hayride'' as [[Jimmy & Johnny]], and released a charting single under the \"Jimmy Lee & Johnny Mathis\" moniker on [[Chess Records]], 1954's \"If You Don't, Somebody Else Will\". Fautheree left Mathis to work with Wayne Walker, a partnership that lasted only four months but yielded a few recordings. Following this he began recording with his brother Lynn, again under the name Jimmy & Johnny; they signed to [[Decca Records]], but by 1957 the pair had moved back to Dallas.\n\nFautheree went back to solo recording, recording in [[New Orleans]] in 1958 at J&M Studio. He recorded briefly with Mathis again between 1958 and 1959. Some self-released material and a single on [[Paula Records]] brought him into 1960, and throughout the next decade Fautheree worked increasingly in the genre of [[gospel music]].\n\nBy the 1970s Fautheree had left the business, working in [[asbestos]] removal. In 1995, he returned to music with Mathis, recording a new single, \"It Won't Be Much Longer\", together. He played both in the U.S. and abroad in the 2000s, and released a full-length album with [[Deke Dickerson]] entitled ''I Found the Doorknob''. Shortly after the album was complete he died of [[cancer]] in Dallas on June 29, 2004.\n\nHis mother's name was Lodema Hammonds, the daughter of Mack Hammonds of Maud, Texas, who was a descendant of [[Phillip Hamman]], the Savior of the Greenbrier.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"350\" | Title\n! width=\"150\" | Record label\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Love Is Hard To Understand / I Keep the Blues All The Time'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Go Ahead and Go / Knocking On Your Front Door'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Lips That Kiss So Sweetly / I\u2019ve Got A Broken Heart'' || Capitol Records \n|----\n| 1952 || ''Suspense / Warm Warm Kisses'' || Capitol Records \n|----\n| 1952 || ''I\u2019m Diggin\u2019 A Hole To Bury My Heart / Kisses By Mail'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1952 || ''Blowin\u2019 And Goin\u2019 / Mistakes'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1953 || ''How About A Date / Cryin\u2019 Won\u2019t Change My Mind'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1955 || ''Lips That Kiss So Sweetly / Love Me'' (with Wayne Walker) || Chess Records\n|----\n| 1958 || ''Teenage Wedding / Baby It\u2019s Love'' (as ''Johnny Angel'') || Vin Records\n|----\n| 1966 || ''Git / Can\u2019t Find The Doorknob'' || Paula Records  \n|----\n| 1966 || ''Keep Me In Mind / Belle Of Monterrey'' || Paula Records\n|----\n| 1974 || ''Project X-9 (Instr.) / I\u2019m The Laziest Man In The World'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| 197? || ''If You Want To Be Saved / Fellowship With Jesus'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| 197? || ''I Just Can\u2019t Keep On / One Day Smiling'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| unknown || ''This Ole House / Heaven Is Only Knee High'' || Little Richie Records\n|----\n| 1963 || '''''EP''''' \n* ''Nobody Knows Where You Go''\n* ''Please Talk To My Heart''\n* ''Taffy Town'' (by Fran Powers)\n* ''Goin\u2019 Steady'' (by Fran Powers)\n|| Towne House Records\n|}\n\n==References==\n*[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p75324/biography|pure_url=yes}} Jimmy Lee Fautheree] at [[Allmusic]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fautheree, Jimmy Lee}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American rockabilly musicians]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Arkansas]]\n[[Category:American session musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Smackover, Arkansas]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Arkansas]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

From age eight he starred alongside his family in the radio and television series ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''. In 1957, he began a long and successful career as a popular recording artist. \n\nHis fame as both a recording artist and television star also led to a motion picture role co-starring alongside [[John Wayne]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Walter Brennan]], and [[Angie Dickinson]] in [[Howard Hawks]]'s [[Western (genre)|western]] feature film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). He placed 54 songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and its predecessors between 1957 and 1973, including \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\" in 1958, which was the first number one song on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's then-newly created [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100 chart]]. He recorded 17 additional top ten hits and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on January 21, 1987.{{sfn|Whitburn|1983|p=491}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=284}} In 1996 Nelson was ranked No. 49 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.<ref name=\"fifty\" />\n\nNelson began his entertainment career in 1949, playing himself in the radio sitcom series ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet''. In 1952, he appeared in his first feature film, ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]''. In 1957, he recorded his first single (\"I'm Walkin' b/w \"A Teenager's Romance\", Verve 10047X4S), debuted as a singer on the television version of the sitcom, and released the No. 1 album ''[[Ricky (album)|Ricky]]''. In 1958, Nelson released his first #1 single, \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\", and in 1959 received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Most Promising Male Newcomer\" after starring in ''Rio Bravo''. A few films followed, and when the television series was cancelled in 1966, Nelson made occasional appearances as a guest star on various television programs. In his twenties, he moved away from the pop music of his youth and began to perform in a [[country rock]] style.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |title=Rick Nelson Biography |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2022-11-23 |archive-date=November 24, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124044719/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |url-status=live }}</ref> After recording several albums with mostly [[session musician]]s, most of which flopped, he formed the Stone Canyon Band in 1969 and experienced a career resurgence, buoyed by the live album ''[[In Concert at the Troubadour, 1969]]'' and had a surprise hit with 1972's \"[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]\", which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. His comeback was short-lived, however, as his record label was bought out and folded, and his followup albums were not well promoted by his new label. He continued to perform live and take small television roles through the 1970s, though his label dropped him by the end of the decade. He released two more albums, with unimpressive results, before [[Death of Ricky Nelson|his death in a plane crash]] on New Year's Eve, 1985.\n\nNelson was married once, to [[Kristin Nelson|Sharon Kristin Harmon]], from 1963 until their divorce in 1982. They had four children: actress [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Nelson]], twin sons and musicians [[Gunnar Nelson (musician)|Gunnar]] and [[Matthew Nelson (musician)|Matthew]], and actor Sam.\n\n==Early life==\nNelson was born on May 8, 1940, in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=2, 16\u201317}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=25}}<ref name=\"NOTE\" /> He was the second son of entertainment couple [[Ozzie Nelson|Ozzie]] and [[Harriet Nelson]].

The film was a hit, and Ozzie was convinced the family could make the transition from radio's airwaves to television's small screen. On October 3, 1952, ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' made its television debut and was broadcast in first run until September 3, 1966, to become one of the longest running sitcoms in television history.\n\n==Education==\nNelson attended Gardner Street Public School,{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=23}} Bancroft Junior High,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=47}} and, between 1954 and 1958, [[Hollywood High School]], from which he graduated with a B average.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} He played [[American football|football]] at Hollywood High{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} and represented the school in interscholastic [[tennis]] matches.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=55}} Twenty-five years later, Nelson told the ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' he hated school because it \"smelled of pencils\" and he was forced to rise early in the morning to attend.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}} In January 1960 the athletic Nelson brothers formed a trapeze act with stunts in the 1/27/1960 episode of \"Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" titled 'THE CIRCUS'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/579275570816609584/|title=RICKY NELSON on the TRAPEZE!

Nelson's first album, ''Ricky'', was released in October 1957 and hit #1 before the end of the year.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=76}} Following these successes, Nelson was given a more prominent role on the ''Ozzie and Harriet'' show and ended every two or three episodes with a musical number.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=80}}\n\nNelson grew increasingly dissatisfied performing with older jazz and country session musicians, who were openly contemptuous of rock and roll. After his Ohio and Minnesota tours in the summer of 1957, he decided to form his own band with members closer to his age.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=81}} Eighteen-year-old electric guitarist [[James Burton]] was the first signed. Bassist James Kirkland, drummer Richie Frost, and pianist Gene Garf completed the band.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=83}} Their first recording together was \"[[Believe What You Say]]\". Prior to this, [[Joe Maphis]] had been playing the lead guitar part, and played lead on his first hits \"Be-Bop Baby\", \"Stood Up\", and \"Waitin In School\".\n\nIn 1958, Nelson recorded 17-year-old [[Sharon Sheeley]]'s \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\" for his second album, ''Ricky Nelson'', released in June 1958.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=89}} Radio airplay brought the tune notice, and Imperial suggested releasing a single, but Nelson opposed the idea, believing a single would diminish EP sales. When a single was released nonetheless, he exercised his contractual right to approve any artwork and vetoed a picture sleeve.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=89\u201390}} On August 4, 1958, \"Poor Little Fool\" became the #1 single on ''Billboard'''s newly instituted Hot 100 singles chart{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=91}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=90}} and sold over two million copies.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}\n\nNelson stated:\n{{blockquote|Anyone who knocks rock 'n' roll either doesn't understand it, or is prejudiced against it, or is just plain square. \u2013 ''[[NME]]'' \u2013 November 1958<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 3\" />}}\n\n[[File:Ricky Nelson - publicity.JPG|thumb|Nelson publicity photo, 1960]]\nDuring 1958 and 1959, Nelson had twelve hits in the charts in comparison with [[Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley's]] eleven.

In the summer of 1958, Nelson conducted his first full-scale tour, averaging $5,000 nightly.

Ozzie Nelson even had the idea to edit footage together to create some of the first music videos. This creative editing can be seen in videos Ozzie produced for \"Travelin' Man\". Nelson appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1967, but his career by that time was in limbo. He also appeared on other television shows (usually in acting roles). In 1973, he had an acting role in an episode of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} He starred in the episode \"A Hand For Sonny Blue\" from the 1977 series ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (known in the United Kingdom as ''Twist in the Tale'').

Nelson worked with many musicians of repute, including [[James Burton]], [[Joe Osborn]], and [[Allen \"Puddler\" Harris]], all natives of [[Louisiana]], and [[Joe Maphis]], [[The Jordanaires]], [[Scotty Moore]], and [[Johnny Burnette|Johnny]] and [[Dorsey Burnette]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nNelson's music was very well recorded with a clear, punchy sound\u2014thanks in part to engineer Bunny Robyn and producer Jimmy Haskell.<ref name=\"Tech\" />\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, Nelson had 30 Top-40 hits, more than any other artist except Presley (who had 53) and [[Pat Boone]] (38).

He made his film debut in ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]'' (1952) and had a small role in ''[[The Story of Three Loves]]'' (1953) at MGM directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]] playing [[Farley Granger]] as a boy.\n\nFollowing his success on TV and with singing, [[Howard Hawks]] cast him as a gunslinger in ''[[Rio Bravo (movie)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959) with [[John Wayne]] and [[Dean Martin]]; Hawks attributed much of the film's box office success to Nelson.\n\nNelson co-starred with [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[The Wackiest Ship in the Army (film)|The Wackiest Ship in the Army]]'' (1960), which was popular enough to give rise to a TV series (in which Nelson did not appear). He guest starred on ''[[General Electric Theatre]]'' (\"The Wish Book\") and starred in a romantic comedy feature written and directed by his father, ''[[Love and Kisses (1965 movie)|Love and Kisses]]'' (1965) with [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]].\n\nNelson guest starred on ''[[Hondo (TV series)|Hondo]]'' (playing [[Jesse James]]), and had a support role in ''[[The Over-the-Hill Gang]]'' (1969) with [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]].\n\nNelson was in ''[[Fol-de-Rol]]'' (1972), guest starred on ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law]]'', ''[[Petrocelli]]'', ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected|A Twist in the Tale]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', and ''[[The Love Boat]]''. On ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' he played the part of \"Tony Eagle\" and performed various well-known Nelson songs throughout the episode.\n\nHe had support roles in the TV films ''[[Three on a Date]]'' and ''[[High School USA]]'' (1983).\n\n==Name change and 1960s career==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2022}}\nOn May 8, 1961 (his 21st birthday), he officially modified his recording name from \"Ricky Nelson\" to \"Rick Nelson\". His childhood nickname proved hard to shake, especially among the generation who had watched him grow up on \"Ozzie and Harriet\". Even in the 1980s, when Nelson realized his dream of meeting [[Carl Perkins]], Perkins noted that he and \"Ricky\" were the last of the \"rockabilly breed\".\n\nIn 1963, Nelson signed a 20-year contract with [[Decca Records]]. After some early successes with the label, most notably 1964's \"For You\" (#6), Nelson's chart career came to a dramatic halt in the wake of [[Beatlemania]], [[The British Invasion]], and later the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture era]]. However, instead of dropping him, Decca kept him on board.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Nelson began to move toward [[country music]], becoming a pioneer in the country-rock genre. He was one of the early influences of the so-called \"[[California Sound]]\" (which would include singers like [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] and bands such as [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]). Yet Nelson himself did not reach the [[Top 40]] again until 1970, when he recorded [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"She Belongs to Me\" with the Stone Canyon Band, featuring [[Randy Meisner]], who in 1971 became a founding member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and former [[The Buckaroos|Buckaroo]] steel guitarist [[Tom Brumley]].\n\n==\"Garden Party\" and short-lived comeback==\n[[File:Rick Nelson performing 1970.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Nelson performing on ''The Jim Nabors Show'' in 1970]]\nIn 1972, Nelson reached the Top 40 one last time with \"[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]],\" a song he wrote in disgust after a [[Richard Nader]] [[Oldies]] Concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] where the audience booed, perhaps against some unrelated police action. However, Nelson may have felt that the reason was because he was playing new songs instead of just his old hits.<ref name=\"straightdope1\" /> When he performed [[The Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Honky Tonk Women]],\" there was booing, said to be against police and not him.<ref name=\"straightdope1\" /> He was watching the rest of the performance on a TV monitor backstage until Richard Nader finally convinced Nelson to return to the stage and play his \"oldies.\" He returned to the stage and played his \"oldies\" and the audience responded with applause, according to Deborah Nader, President of Richard Nader Entertainment. He wanted to record an album featuring original material, but the single was released before the album because Nelson had not completed the entire ''Garden Party'' album yet. \"Garden Party\" reached No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #1 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart]] and was certified as a [[RIAA certification|gold single]]. The second single released from the album was \"Palace Guard\" which peaked at #65.\n\nIn 1973, [[MCA Records]], whose parent company [[MCA Inc.]] had owned American Decca since 1962, ceased the label's operations, and transferred Nelson (and many other Decca artists) to its roster. His comeback was short-lived, and Nelson's band soon resigned. MCA wanted Nelson to have a producer on his next album. A new band was formed by [[Lindy Goetz]], then a promotion person at MCA Records.<ref name=\"GoodReads\" /> Nelson's band moved to Aspen and changed their name to \"Canyon.\" Nelson and the new Stone Canyon Band began to tour for the ''[[Garden Party (album)|Garden Party]]'' album. Nelson still played nightclubs and bars, but he soon advanced to higher-paying venues because of the success of ''Garden Party.''\n\nIn 1974, MCA was unsure as to what to do with the former teen idol. Albums like ''[[Windfall (Rick Nelson album)|Windfall]]'' failed to have an impact. Nelson became an attraction at theme parks like [[Knott's Berry Farm]] and [[Disneyland]]. He also started appearing in minor roles on television shows.\n\nNelson tried to score another hit but did not have any luck with songs like \"Rock and Roll Lady.\" With seven years to go on his contract, MCA dropped him from the label.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Rick kris nelson 1964.JPG|thumb|Ricky and Kristin Nelson in 1964]]\n\nIn 1957, when Nelson was 17, he met and fell in love with [[Marianne Gaba]], who played the role of Ricky's girlfriend in three episodes of ''Ozzie and Harriet''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=136}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=72}} Nelson and Gaba were too young to enter a serious relationship, although according to Gaba \"we used to [[Making out|neck]] ''for hours''.\"{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=137}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=73}}\n\nThe next year, Nelson fell in love with 15-year-old [[Lorrie Collins]], a country singer appearing on a weekly telecast called ''Town Hall Party''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=106}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=81}} The two wrote Nelson's first composition, the song \"My Gal\", and she introduced him to [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Tex Ritter]].

In October 1977, Kris filed for divorce and asked for alimony, custody of their four children, and a portion of community property. The couple temporarily resolved their differences, but Kris retained her attorney to pursue a permanent break.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=230}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=205}} Kris wanted Rick to give up music, spend more time at home, and focus on acting, but the family enjoyed a recklessly expensive lifestyle, and Kris's extravagant spending left Rick no choice but to tour relentlessly.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=251}} The impasse over Rick's career created unpleasantness at home.

Although he recorded three more songs with Mercury, his contract was soon terminated.<ref name=mcdowell />\n\n===Rock and roll career===\nIn 1958, Twitty's fortunes improved when an Ohio radio station had an inspiration, refraining from playing \"I'll Try\" (an MGM single that went nowhere in terms of sales, radio play, and [[jukebox]] play), instead playing the B-side, \"[[It's Only Make Believe]]\", a song written between sets by Twitty and drummer Jack Nance when they were in Hamilton, Ontario, playing at the Flamingo Lounge.<ref name=\"MEMPROJ44\">{{Cite press release |title=The Hamilton Memory Project |date=June 10, 2006 |publisher=Hamilton Spectator Newspaper, Souvenir Edition |page=MP44}}</ref> The record took several months to reach and stay at the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1958|top spot]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop music charts in the United States and number 1 in 21 other countries, becoming the first of nine top-40 hits for Twitty.

Twitty would go on to enjoy rock-and-roll success with songs including \"[[Danny Boy]]\" (Pop number 10) and \"[[Lonely Blue Boy (song)|Lonely Blue Boy]]\" (Pop number 6). \"Lonely Blue Boy\", originally titled \"Danny\", was recorded by Presley for the film ''[[King Creole]]'' but was not used in the soundtrack. This song led to him naming his band the Lonely Blue Boys. They subsequently became the Twitty Birds.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> As his recording career continued, Twitty's music shifted from rockabilly to [[rock and roll]], and Twitty also recorded some [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]] singles.<ref name=Koda/>\n\nBy 1965, Twitty had become disillusioned with rock & roll, particularly with the behavior of the fans,<ref name=ellison /> and walked out of a show in the middle of a performance in New Jersey.<ref name=bronson/> He sued his manager to be released from his contract, and moved to perform country music in [[Oklahoma City]].<ref name=ellison>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1qyHCmpT7EC&pg=PA248 |title=Country Music Culture: From Hard Times to Heaven|first= Curtis W. |last=Ellison |date= 1995|isbn=9781604739343 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi|page=248}}</ref>\n\n===Country music career===\nTwitty always wanted to record country music, and, beginning in 1965, he did just that. Disc jockeys on some country-music radio stations refused to play his first few country albums, because he was known as a rock and roll singer. However, he had his first top-five country hit, \"The Image of Me\", in July 1968, followed by his first number one country song, \"[[Next in Line (Conway Twitty song)|Next in Line]]\", in November 1968. Few of his singles beginning in 1968 ranked below the top five.\n\nIn 1970, Twitty recorded and released his biggest country hit, \"[[Hello Darlin' (song)|Hello Darlin']]\", which spent four weeks at the top of the country chart and is one of Twitty's most recognized songs. In 1971, he released his first hit duet with [[Loretta Lynn]], \"[[After the Fire Is Gone]]\". It was a success, and many more followed, including \"[[Lead Me On (Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn song)|Lead Me On]]\" (1971), \"[[Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man (song)|Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man]]\" (1973), \"[[As Soon As I Hang Up the Phone]]\" (1974), \"[[Feelins']]\" (1975), \"I Still Believe in Waltzes\", \"[[I Can't Love You Enough]]\", and many others. Together, Conway and Loretta (as they were known in their act) won four consecutive [[Country Music Association]] awards for vocal duo (1972\u20131975) and a host of other duo and duet awards from other organizations throughout the 1970s.\n\nIn 1973, Twitty released \"[[You've Never Been This Far Before]]\", which was number 1 in country for three weeks that September and also reached number 22 on the pop charts. Some more conservative disc jockeys refused to play the song, believing that some of the lyrics were too sexually suggestive.\n\nIn 1978, Twitty issued the single \"The Grandest Lady of Them All\" honoring the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''. (Somewhat ironically, Twitty was never inducted into the ''Opry'' during his lifetime; he remains one of the more prominent [[Nashville]] country artists never to have been an Opry member.) The single reached the top 20, peaking at number 16, but it was well below expectations; it was the first time since 1967 that a single of his failed to reach the top ten, as some radio stations refused to play a song honoring the property of a competitor (broadcast by [[WSM-AM]]).\n\nTwitty soon renewed his image with a new hairstyle, changing from the slicked-back [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]] style to the curlier style he would keep for the rest of his life; by the late 1970s, Twitty had shifted his musical arrangements into a [[country pop]] style he would maintain for the rest of his career.<ref name=Kamau>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicrockhistory.com/top-10-conway-twitty-songs/ |title=Top 10 Conway Twitty Songs |last=Kamau |first=Eric |date=January 2022 |publisher=Classic Rock History |access-date=2022-11-18}}</ref> His next 23 consecutive singles all made it into the top 10, with 13 reaching number one, including \"[[Don't Take It Away]]\", \"[[I May Never Get to Heaven]]\", \"[[Happy Birthday Darlin']]\", and remakes of major pop hits such as \"[[The Rose (song)|The Rose]]\", \"[[Slow Hand]]\" and \"Tight Fittin' Jeans\", a song written by Michael Huffman, released in June 1981 as the first single from the album ''Mr. T''. The song was Twitty's 26th number one on the country chart. The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of 10 weeks on the country chart. In 1985, going by all weekly music trade charts, the song \"[[Don't Call Him a Cowboy]]\" became the 50th single of his career to achieve a number-one ranking. He would have five more through 1990, giving him a total of 55 number-one hits. [[George Strait]] matched the feat of 50 number-one hits in 2002 with his single \"[[She'll Leave You with a Smile]]\" and then reached number 1 for the 56th time in 2007, when the single \"[[Wrapped (Bruce Robison song)|Wrapped]]\" hit the top on the Media Base 24/7 list.\n\nThroughout much of Twitty's country music career his recording home was Decca Records, later renamed [[MCA Records|MCA]]. He signed with the label in late 1965 but left in 1981, when it appeared MCA was marketing and promoting newer acts; management at the label had changed, in addition to other factors that brought on the decision. He joined Elektra/Asylum in 1982. That label's country music unit merged with sister label [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1983. He stayed with Warner Bros. through early 1987 but then went back to MCA to finish his career. In 1993, shortly before he died, he recorded a new album, ''[[Final Touches]]''.\n\n===Films===\nTwitty had a short career in films, appearing in a few [[B-movies]] in 1960 in which he acted and sang, starting with ''[[Platinum High School]]'', followed by ''[[College Confidential (film)|College Confidential]]'' and ''[[Sex Kittens Go to College]]''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjrAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA409 |title=Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary|first= Richard |last=Carlin |date= 2014|isbn=9781135361044 |publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=409}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT4UAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA204 |title=All Roots Lead to Rock: Legends of Early Rock 'n' Roll : a Bear Family Reader |author= Bear Family Records |date= 1999 |publisher=Schirmer Books|page=204|isbn=9780028648668 }}</ref>\n\n===Baseball===\n[[File:Conway Twitty Nashville Sounds first pitch April 26, 1978.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Twitty throwing out the first pitch at the first [[Nashville Sounds]] game on April 26, 1978]]\nTwitty also played baseball, his second passion.

His first marriage, to Ellen Matthews, lasted from 1953 to 1954. They had married because Ellen was pregnant with their son, Michael. His second, and longest, marriage was to Temple \"Mickey\" Medley. They were married in 1956 and had three children: Kathy, Joni Lee, and Jimmy Twitty. The couple were divorced in early 1970, but they remarried quietly by the end of 1970. By 1984, after 28 years of marriage on and off, the stress of Twitty's frequent absences took its toll on Mickey, and she and Conway divorced. Mickey Twitty died in 2021. In 1987, Twitty married his 36-year-old office secretary, Delores \"Dee\" Henry, who became his widow in June 1993.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hevesi |first=Dennis |date=June 6, 1993 |title=Conway Twitty, 59, Dies on Tour; Country Star Had 50 No. 1 Songs |language=en-US |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/obituaries/conway-twitty-59-dies-on-tour-country-star-had-50-no-1-songs.html |access-date=2021-11-09 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nTwitty made [[Oklahoma City]] his home during most of his recording career, from 1963 to 1972.

[[John Hughey]], who was Twitty's steel guitar player, found him on the ground. Many people, including family members, said that Twitty underwent a change in personality after the accident.\n\nTwitty served on the board of directors of [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] (Country Music Television) from 1984 to 1988, after Music Village Group (Nyhl Henson, Gilbert Biggers, Hall Hardaway Jr. and Benny and Dean Jaggers) acquired CMTV from Glen Daniels. (Inheriting a copyright infringement suit from Viacom, owner of MTV, settled for an undisclosed sum.) The Music Village Group, built Music Village USA adjacent to Twitty City including a state-of-the-art 1,776-seat theatre where CMT uplinked its 24-hour programming and produced live concerts. When Music Village and Twitty was sold in 1989 and CMT in 1990, Conway turned his attention to the burgeoning [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] market playing to sell-out crowds.

Conway's most recent appearance on the country charts was a duet with [[Anita Cochran]], \"(I Want to Hear) A Cheating Song\" (2004), which was made possible by splicing Twitty's vocal from old recordings and interviews, recorded over the years. As a result, Twitty's isolated vocal track was transferred to a digital multitrack and digitally reassembled into the new performance. Like the electronic duets of [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Jim Reeves]], [[Hank Williams]] and [[Hank Williams Jr.]], or [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Natalie Cole]], Cochran added her vocal to backing tracks that had already been produced along with Twitty's reconstructed vocals.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nCurrently, Bear Family Records offers the single-disc collection ''Conway Rocks'', featuring 30 songs, and ''The Rock 'n' Roll Years'', a comprehensive eight-disc box set showcasing his complete early recordings as a rock artist.<ref>[https://www.bear-family.com/twitty-conway/ Who was/is Twitty, Conway?] Bear Family Records.</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n===Taxes===\nTwitty's success in country music was a key factor in his winning the 1983 case ''Harold L. Jenkins (a/k/a Conway Twitty) v. Commissioner'' in United States Tax Court. The Internal Revenue Service allowed Twitty to deduct from his taxes, as an \"ordinary and necessary\" business expense, payments that he had made to repay investors in a defunct fast-food chain called Twitty Burger; the chain disestablished in 1971.

His widow in 1993, Delores \"Dee\" Henry Jenkins, and his four grown children from the previous marriages, Michael, [[Joni Lee|Joni]], Kathy and Jimmy Jenkins, engaged in a public dispute over the estate. Twitty's will had not been updated to account for the fourth marriage, but Tennessee law reserves one third of any estate to the widow. After years of probate, the four children received the rights to Twitty's music, name and image. The rest of the estate went to public auction, where much of the property and memorabilia was sold after his widow rejected the appraised value.\n\nIn 2008, controversy again erupted in his family when the four remaining children sued [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] over an agreement that Twitty and his family signed in 1990. The suit alleged that the terms of the agreement were not fully understood by the children, although they were all adults at the time. It sought to recover copyrights and royalty revenue that the document assigned to the company.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 1, 2008 |title=Twitty's children sue Sony for royalties |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/conway-twitty/news/twittys-children-sue-sony-for-royalties--57964316 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712082622/http://new.music.yahoo.com/conway-twitty/news/twittys-children-sue-sony-for-royalties--57964316 |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

He was raised by his maternal grandparents in [[Louise, Mississippi]], where they had a small farm and [[dry goods]] store.\n\nSmith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the [[United States Air Force]] stationed in San Antonio, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], and auditioned, successfully, to play the Cotton Club, a local nightclub. The steel guitarist [[Stan Kesler]], who was playing there with the Snearly Ranch Boys, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to [[Sun Records]] to audition for [[Sam Phillips]], with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup.\n\nPhillips liked what he heard and decided that \"Rock 'n' Roll Ruby\", a song credited to [[Johnny Cash]], would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that the song was actually written by [[George Jones]] and sold to Cash for $40.){{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Smith recorded it on February 5, 1956. Phillips, playing it safe in case rock and roll did not maintain its popularity, released it with a country crooner, aptly named \"I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry\", on the flip side. By May 26, \"Rock 'n' Roll Ruby\" had reached number 1 on the local pop chart; this record, his first for Sun, went on to outsell the first Sun releases by [[Elvis Presley]], Johnny Cash and [[Carl Perkins]].\n\nIn August 1956, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release, \"[[Ubangi Stomp]]\", an infectious rocker with crude lyrics and vocals suggesting an African chief with the [[syntax]] of a movie Indian. For the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], he recorded the classic ballad \"[[The Gypsy Laddie|Black Jack David]]\", a song that originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American South; it may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock-and-roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success, this record did not sell as well as Smith's debut.\n\nIn 1957, Smith recorded \"So Long, I'm Gone\", a song written by [[Roy Orbison]]. It became his biggest hit for Sun, peaking at number 74 on the ''Billboard'' national chart. But Sun had no cash to promote it, as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On]]\". Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun, including a [[cover version]] of [[Slim Harpo]]'s \"Got Love If You Want It\" (recorded in October 1957), but these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958, seeing his future in [[country music]], he cut a final record for Sun, a cover version of [[Don Gibson]]'s \"Sweet Sweet Girl\". In spite of a review in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' calling it \"ultra commercial\", this record also did not sell well. Like other artists such as [[Sonny Burgess]], [[Hayden Thompson]], [[Billy Lee Riley]] and [[Ray Harris]], Smith had little success on the charts.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Du Noyer\n| year= 2003\n| title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music\n| edition= \n| publisher= Flame Tree Publishing \n| location= Fulham, London\n| isbn= 1-904041-96-5\n| page= 19}}</ref> He then decided to leave Sun Records.\n\nIn 1959, Smith and his wife and son moved from Mississippi to California, settling in Sherman Oaks, not far from Johnny and Vivian Cash. Cash offered Smith a spot on his show, but Smith turned it down, seeing himself as a headliner, not a supporting player. In early 1960, Smith signed a contract with [[Liberty Records]] and immediately had a hit with \"I Don't Believe I'll Fall in Love Today\", which went to number 5 on the ''Billboard'' country and Western chart. This record and subsequent Liberty releases were produced by [[Joe Allison]] and featured one of California's best country session musicians, [[Ralph Mooney]], on [[pedal steel guitar]]. Smith scored again with his next record for Liberty, \"Odds and Ends, Bits and Pieces\", written by [[Harlan Howard]]. He recorded several more tracks for Liberty, mostly cover versions of recent country hits, to fill out an album, ''The First Country Collection of Warren Smith''. He continued to record for Liberty, with some success, and toured with his band, from 1960 to 1965.\n\nOn August 17, 1965, Smith suffered severe back injuries in a car crash in [[LaGrange, Texas]]. It took nearly a year for him to recover. By this time, his contract with Liberty had lapsed. He made several attempts to restart his career, first with a small, virtually amateur label called Skill Records, and then with [[Mercury Records]], but addictions to pills and alcohol held him back. Eventually, he was convicted of robbing a pharmacy and sentenced to an 18-month term in an Alabama prison.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Smith again tried to restart his career. He got some publicity from the rockabilly revival in the late 1970s. In 1977 he was invited to appear at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], on a bill featuring [[Charlie Feathers]], [[Buddy Knox]] and [[Jack Scott (singer)|Jack Scott]]. To his shock, Smith was received in London with standing ovations. His reception in England boosted his spirits and, upon his return to the United States, he began to perform with newfound vigor. In November 1978, Smith and fellow Sun alumnus [[Ray Smith (rockabilly singer)|Ray Smith]] toured Europe, again with great success.\n\nSmith died of a heart attack, at 47 years of age, in 1980, while preparing for another European tour.\n\n==Legacy==\nSmith's contribution to rockabilly music has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. [[Bob Dylan]] repeatedly featured Smith on his [[XM Satellite Radio]] show, ''[[Theme Time Radio Hour]]'', playing Smith's records \"Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache\", \"Uranium Rock\", \"Ubangi Stomp\" and \"So Long, I'm Gone\". Dylan recorded a studio version of \"Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache\" in 2001; he also played that song and another recorded by Smith, \"Uranium Rock\", in concert in 1986. \nIn 2015, \"Uranium Rock\" was also featured in the video game ''[[Fallout 4]]''. \"Uranium Rock\" was also covered by [[The Cramps]] on their second compilation album \"Bad Music For Bad People\".\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Thompson then joined the Dixie Jazzlanders who toured Mississippi.  He relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and made an unreleased recording in 1956.  \"Love My Baby\" was issued on the Phillips International label in September 1957, and Thompson toured alongside [[Sonny Burgess]] and [[Billy Lee Riley]].  The following year, Thompson moved again, this time to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he gained a residency at the Rivoli Ballroom, Chicago's latest country music venue.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\nThompson's recording of \"$16.88\" for [[Kapp Records]] sold sufficiently to secure him an offer to record his debut album.  ''Here's Hayden Thompson'' was released in 1967.  Several recordings took place in the early-1970s, but circumstances meant that Thompson left the music industry at this point and worked as a limo driver.  He re-emerged in the mid-1980s, becoming a regular performer on rockabilly revival touring packages.  Charley Records released an album of his in 1985.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>  Further albums were released, mainly by various European record labels, over the three decades.

He was strongly influenced by his parents, who were members of the Landmark Missionary Baptist Church; his mother, Helen Rich, played piano in church and his father sang in gospel quartets. A black sharecropper on the family land named C. J. Allen taught Rich blues piano. He enrolled at [[Arkansas State College]] on a football scholarship and then after an injury, transferred to the [[University of Arkansas]] as a music major. He left after one semester to join the [[United States Air Force]] in 1953.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nHe married Margaret Ann Greene in 1952. While stationed in [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]], Oklahoma, he formed \"the Velvetones\", playing jazz and blues and featuring his wife on vocals.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> When he left the military in 1956, the couple returned to the West Memphis area to farm 500 acres. He also began performing in clubs around the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] area, playing both jazz and [[R&B]], and began writing his own material.\n\n==Career==\nAfter recording some demonstration songs for [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]] that Phillips considered \"too jazzy\" and insufficiently commercial, Rich was given a stack of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] records and told: \"Come back when you get that bad.\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In a 1992 interview with ''[[Fresh Air]]'' host [[Terry Gross]], Rich himself recalled [[Bill Justis]] telling Rich's wife those words.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=129612715 |title=Charlie Rich: The Silver Fox With A Big Country Sound |publisher=Npr.org |date=September 6, 2010 |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Rich became a regular [[session musician]] for Sun Records, playing on a variety of records by Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bill Justis]], [[Warren Smith (singer)|Warren Smith]], [[Billy Lee Riley]], [[Carl Mann]], and [[Ray Smith (rockabilly singer)|Ray Smith]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He also wrote several songs for Lewis, Cash, and others.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAfter he began recording for the Sun subsidiary [[Phillips International Records]], his third single was the 1960 Top 30 hit \"Lonely Weekends\",<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> with [[Elvis Presley|Presley]]-like vocals.

In 1965 he moved to [[Smash Records]], where his new producer, [[Jerry Kennedy]], encouraged him to emphasize his country and rock n' roll leanings, although Rich considered himself a jazz pianist and had not paid much attention to country music since childhood.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> His first single for Smash was \"Mohair Sam\", an R&B-inflected [[Novelty song|novelty]]-rock number written by [[Dallas Frazier]], which became a top 30 pop hit. It has been mentioned in thousands of articles as the song Elvis Presley   played on his jukebox during the Beatles' visit to his home on August 26, 1965. However, once more none of his follow-up singles were successful. Rich again changed labels, moving to [[Hi Records]], where he recorded [[blue-eyed soul]] music and straight country, but once more, none of his singles for Hi made a dent on the country or pop charts. One Hi Records track, \"Love Is After Me\" (1966), belatedly became a [[white soul]] favorite in the early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\n===Career peak in the 1970s===\nDespite his lack of consistent commercial success, [[Epic Records]] signed Rich in 1967, mainly on the recommendation of producer [[Billy Sherrill]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Sherrill helped Rich refashion himself as a [[Nashville Sound]] balladeer during an era when old rock 'n' roll artists like Jerry Lee Lewis and [[Conway Twitty]] were finding a new musical home in the Country format. This new \"[[countrypolitan]]\" Rich sound paid off in the summer of 1972, when \"I Take It on Home\" went to number six on the country charts.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The title track from his 1973 album ''Behind Closed Doors'' became a number-one country hit early in that year, then crossed over into the top 20 on the pop charts.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> This time, his follow-up single did not disappoint, as \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl]]\" spent three weeks at the top of the country charts and two weeks at the top of the pop charts.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Now that he was established as a country music star, ''Behind Closed Doors'' won three awards from the [[Country Music Association]] that year: Best Male Vocalist, Album of the Year, and Single of the Year. The album was also certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]]. Rich won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, and he took home four [[Academy of Country Music]] awards. One of [[RCA Victor]]'s several resident songwriters, Marvin Walters, co-wrote for three years with Rich, producing four recordings including the popular \"Set Me Free\".{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\nAfter \"The Most Beautiful Girl,\" number-one hits came quickly, five songs topping the country charts in 1974 and crossed over to the pop charts:<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"There Won't Be Anymore\" (pop number 18), \"[[A Very Special Love Song]]\" (pop number 11), \"I Don't See Me In Your Eyes Anymore\" (pop number 47), \"I Love My Friend\" (pop number 24), and \"She Called Me Baby\" (pop number 47). Both RCA Records and [[Mercury Records]] (Smash was a subsidiary of Mercury that was absorbed into the main company in 1970) also re-released his previously recorded material from the mid-1960s.

His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website:<blockquote>I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis.&nbsp;... So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed.&nbsp;... Primarily he thought it would be funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver.<ref name=\"charlierichjr.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierichjr.com/controversy/the_envelope_burning/ |title=The Envelope Burning |publisher=Charlie Rich Jr. |access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe slump in Rich's career was exacerbated by the fact that his records began to sound increasingly similar: pop-inflected country ballads with [[overdub]]bed [[string instruments|strings]] and little jazz or blues. He did not have a top-10 hit again until \"[[Rollin' With the Flow]]\" went to number one on the country charts (as well as number 32 on the easy listening charts) in 1977.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Early the following year, in 1978, he signed with [[United Artists Records]], and throughout that year, he had hits on both Epic and UA. His hits in 1978 included the top-10 hits \"Beautiful Woman\", \"Puttin' In Overtime At Home\", and his last number one with \"[[On My Knees (1978 song)|On My Knees]]\", a duet with [[Janie Fricke]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===Decline in activity and semi-retirement===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2022}}\nIn 1979, Rich had moderate success with his singles, his biggest hit being a version of \"[[Spanish Eyes (1965 song)|Spanish Eyes]]\" that entered the country top 20.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Greatest Country Hits of 1979 |url=http://www.severing.nu/music/c1979.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=www.severing.nu}}</ref> He appeared as himself in the 1978 [[Clint Eastwood]] movie ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way but Loose]]'', performing \"I'll Wake You Up When I Get Home\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> This song hit number three on the country charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 country single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to [[Elektra Records]] and that fall released a number-12 country single, \"A Man Just Don't Know What a Woman Goes Through\". One more top-40 hit followed, the [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]] song \"Are We Dreamin' the Same Dream\" early in 1981. Also in 1981, he had a bit part in the movie ''[[Take This Job and Shove It (film)|Take This Job and Shove It]]'', which yielded his last charted single, \"You Made It Beautiful\". Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight, and for over a decade he lived off his investments in semi-retirement, only playing occasional concerts. \n\nIn 1992, Rich emerged from his semi-retirement to release on [[Sire Records]] ''Pictures and Paintings'', a jazzy album produced by journalist [[Peter Guralnick]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It received positive critical reviews and restored Rich's reputation as a musician, but it was his last album.

Siblings included brothers Jay and Clayton.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 8\u20139.]]</ref> The boys grew up hearing [[Southern gospel]] music sung by white friends in church and by black field workers and sharecroppers in the cotton fields.<ref name=pc8>{{Pop Chronicles|8|3}}</ref> On Saturday nights Perkins would listen to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', broadcast from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on his father's radio.\n\n[[Roy Acuff]]'s broadcasts from the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor.]]</ref> Since they could not afford to buy one, his father made one from a [[cigar box guitar|cigar box]] and a broomstick. Eventually, a neighbor sold his father a worn-out [[Gene Autry]] guitar. Perkins could not afford new strings, and when they broke, he had to retie them. The knots cut his fingers when he would slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of [[blue note]].<ref name=\"naylor118\" /><ref name=\":0\">[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 13\u201314.]]</ref>\n\nPerkins taught himself parts of Acuff's \"[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|Great Speckled Bird]]\" and \"[[The Wabash Cannonball]]\", having heard them played on the ''Opry''. He also has cited [[Bill Monroe]]'s fast playing and vocals as an early influence.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 11\u201312.]]</ref> Perkins also learned from John Westbrook, an African-American field worker in his sixties who played blues and gospel music on an old acoustic guitar. Westbrook advised Perkins to \"Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate.\"<ref name=\"naylor118\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn January 1947, the Perkins family moved from [[Lake County, Tennessee]], to [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]], 70 miles from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the largest city in West Tennessee and a center of a great variety of music played by both black and white artists.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 55.]]</ref> At age fourteen Perkins wrote a country song called \"Let Me Take You to the Movie, Magg\". [[Sam Phillips]] was later persuaded by the quality of that song to sign Perkins to his [[Sun Records]] label.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 68.]]</ref>\n\n===Beginnings as a performer===\nPerkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainers during late 1946 at the Cotton Boll tavern on Highway 45, twelve miles south of Jackson, Tennessee, starting on Wednesday nights. Perkins was 14 years old. One of the songs they played was an up-tempo country blues shuffle version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\". Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a tavern, and Perkins drank four beers that first night. Within a month Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch tavern, near the western boundary of Jackson.

Columbia CS9981 (1969).</ref> Perkins appeared with Cash on TV on the popular country series ''[[Hee Haw]]'', on February 16, 1974.\n\n[[Tommy Cash]] (brother of Johnny Cash) had a Top Ten country gospel hit in 1970, with a recording of the song \"Rise and Shine\", written by Perkins. It reached number 9 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and number 8 on the Canadian country chart. [[Arlene Harden]] had a Top 40 country hit in 1971 with the Perkins composition \"True Love Is Greater Than Friendship\", from the film ''[[Little Fauss and Big Halsy]]'' (1971). [[Al Martino]]'s cover of the song that same year reached number 22 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and number 33 on the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nAfter a long legal struggle with Sam Phillips over [[royalties]], Perkins gained ownership of his songs in the 1970s and, in 2003, his widow and then owner of the catalog entered into an administration contract with Paul McCartney's [[MPL Communications]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |author=Mike Kovacich |url=http://www.macca-central.com/macca-news/morenews.php?id=1157 |title=MACCA-News: McCartney to Administer Perkins's Music |publisher=Macca-central.com |date=April 17, 2003 |access-date=2011-11-25 |archive-date=February 13, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213055837/http://www.macca-central.com/macca-news/morenews.php?id=1157 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Later years===\nThe rockabilly revival of the 1980s helped bring Perkins back into the limelight. In 1981 Perkins recorded the song \"Get It\" with [[Paul McCartney]], providing vocals and playing guitar with the former Beatle; according to one source, he fully co-wrote the song with McCartney.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor, p. 145.]]</ref> This recording was included on the chart-topping album ''[[Tug of War (Paul McCartney album)|Tug of War]]'', released in 1982.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpgr.co.uk/pctc259.html |title=Tug Of War |publisher=Jpgr.co.uk |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref>  During 1985, Perkins re-recorded \"Blue Suede Shoes\" with [[Lee Rocker]] and [[Slim Jim Phantom]] of the [[Stray Cats]], as part of the soundtrack for the film ''[[Porky's Revenge]]''.\n\nIn October 1985, Perkins was joined on stage in [[London]] for a television special, ''[[Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session]]'', by [[George Harrison]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Dave Edmunds]], Lee Rocker, [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[Ringo Starr]]. The show was taped live at the [[Limehouse Studios]]. It was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] on January 1, 1986. Perkins performed 16 songs, with two encores, in an extraordinary performance. He and his friends ended the session by singing \"Blue Suede Shoes\", his most famous song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears. The concert special was a highlight of his later career. It has been praised by fans for the spirited performances delivered by Perkins and his guests. The concert was released for DVD by Snapper Music in 2006.<ref>DVD ''Carl Perkins & Friends''. Released by Graham Nolder/Snapper Music. 2006. Cat:SDVD514</ref>\n\nPerkins was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1985. Wider recognition of his contribution to music came with his induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1987. \"Blue Suede Shoes\" was chosen as one of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|\u201c500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll\u201d]]. The song also received a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]]. Perkins was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] in recognition of his pioneering contribution to the genre.\n\nPerkins's only notable film performance as an actor was in [[John Landis]]'s 1985 film ''[[Into the Night (1985 film)|Into the Night]]''. The cameo-laden film includes a scene in which characters played by Perkins and [[David Bowie]] die by each other's hand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089346/fullcredits#cast|title=Into the Night (1985): Full Cast & Crew|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>\n\nPerkins returned to the Sun Studio in Memphis in 1986, joining Cash, Jerry Lee Lewis, and [[Roy Orbison]] on the album ''[[Class of '55]]''. The record was a tribute to their early years at Sun and, specifically, the Million Dollar Quartet [[jam session]] involving Perkins, Presley, Cash, and Lewis in 1956.\n\nIn 1989, Perkins co-wrote and played guitar on [[the Judds]]' number 1 country hit, \"Let Me Tell You About Love\". Also in that year, he signed a record deal with Platinum Records for the album ''Friends, Family, and Legends'', featuring performances by [[Chet Atkins]], [[Travis Tritt]], [[Steve Wariner]], [[Joan Jett]] and [[Charlie Daniels]], along with [[Paul Shaffer]] and Will Lee. The song \"Wild Texas Wind\" became the title track to a made-for-TV [[Wild Texas Wind|movie]] featuring [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Gary Busey]]. In 1996 [[Willie Nelson]], who also appeared in that movie, would join Carl in a duett version of the song. During the production of this album, Perkins was diagnosed with [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]]. \nDolly Parton had a Top 20 Country hit in 1991 with the Perkins co-written [[Silver and Gold (Dolly Parton song)|\"Silver and Gold\"]].\n\n[[Mark O'Connor]] recorded a version of the Perkins classic [[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|\"Restless\"]] in 1991 and had a #25 Country hit with it in the US (#19 in Canada).\n\nHe again returned to Sun Studio to record with Scotty Moore, Presley's first guitar player, for the album ''706 ReUNION'', released by Belle Meade Records, which also featured [[D. J. Fontana]], Marcus Van Storey and [[the Jordanaires]]. In 1993, Perkins performed with the [[Kentucky Headhunters]] in a music video remake of his song \"Dixie Fried\", filmed in [[Glasgow, Kentucky]]. In 1994, he teamed up with [[Duane Eddy]] and [[the Mavericks]] to contribute \"Matchbox\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nHis last album, ''[[Go Cat Go!]]'', released by the independent label Dinosaur Records in 1996, features Perkins singing duets with [[Bono]], Johnny Cash, [[John Fogerty]], George Harrison, Paul McCartney, [[Willie Nelson]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Paul Simon]], and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/albums/go_cat_go.html |title=Carl Perkins/Various Artists: Go Cat Go! |publisher=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Carl Perkins|chart=all}} ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>\n\nHis last major concert performance was the [[Music for Montserrat]] all-star charity concert at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on September 15, 1997, four months before his death.\n\n==Personal life==\nA strong advocate for the prevention of child abuse, Perkins worked with the Jackson Exchange Club to establish the first center for the prevention of child abuse in Tennessee and the fourth in the nation. Proceeds from a concert planned by Perkins were combined with a grant from the [[National Exchange Club]] to establish the Prevention of Child Abuse in October 1981. For years its annual Circle of Hope Telethon generated one quarter of the center's annual operating budget.<ref>Tennessee Historical Commission</ref>\n\nPerkins had one daughter, Debbie, and three sons, Stan, Greg, and Steve.  Stan, Perkins' firstborn son, is also a recording artist. In 2010, he joined forces with [[Jerry Naylor]] to record a duet tribute, \"To Carl: Let It Vibrate\". Stan has been inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

Felts enjoyed modest pop success in 1960 with a remake of the Drifters' \"Honey Love\",<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which earned a low position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. He went on to release such songs as \"Lonely Teardrops\" and \"Pink And Black Days\", but he did not begin enjoying success on a national level as a country singer until the 1970s.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> His first major hit came in 1973, with a cover of Dobie Gray's \"[[Drift Away]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Felts' version \u2013 number eight on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart in September 1973 \u2013 was midtempo country compared to Gray's blues version. The follow-up single, \"All in the Name of Love\", just missed hitting the top 10 in December 1973.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nFelts continued to enjoy modest success during the next year and a half, when he signed with [[ABC Records|ABC-Dot Records]] in 1975.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> That year, he enjoyed his biggest hit, a cover of [[Johnny Adams]]' soul classic \"Reconsider Me\",<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which showcased his falsetto and high tenor.

Reed's grandparents lived in [[Rockmart, Georgia|Rockmart]] and he would visit them from time to time. As a small child running around strumming his guitar he is quoted as saying \"I am gonna be a star. I'm gonna go to [[Nashville]] and be a star.\" Reed's parents separated four months after his birth; he and his sister spent seven years in [[foster home]]s or [[orphanage]]s growing up. Reed was reunited with his mother and stepfather in 1944.\n\nReed graduated from O'Keefe High School, an Atlanta city school. The O'Keefe building still exists today; it was sold to [[Georgia Tech]] and is now part of the university's campus. By high school, Reed was already writing and singing music, having learned to play the guitar as a child. At age 18, he was signed by publisher and record producer [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] to cut his first record, \"[[If the Good Lord's Willing and the Creek Don't Rise]]\".\n\nAt [[Capitol Records]] Reed was promoted as a new \"teen-age sensation\" after recording his own [[rockabilly]] composition \"When I Found You\" in 1956. He recorded both country and rockabilly singles and found success as a songwriter when label mate [[Gene Vincent]] covered his song \"Crazy Legs\" in 1958.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nBy 1958, [[Bill Lowery (record producer)|Bill Lowery]] signed Reed to his company, [[National Recording Corporation]]. He recorded for NRC as both an artist and as a member of the staff band which included [[Joe South]] and [[Ray Stevens]], other NRC artists.\n\nReed married [[Priscilla Mitchell|Priscilla \"Prissy\" Mitchell]] in 1959. They had two daughters, Seidina Ann Hubbard, born April 2, 1960, and Charlotte Elaine (Lottie) Zavala, born October 19, 1970. Mitchell was a member of folk group The Appalachians (\"Bony Moronie\", 1963), and with [[Roy Drusky]] was co-credited on the 1965 country No. 1 \"[[Yes, Mr. Peters]]\".\n\n==Career==\nIn 1959, Reed hit the Billboard \"Bubbling Under the Top 100\", also known as the Roar and Cashbox Country chart with the single \"Soldier's Joy\". After serving two years in the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], Reed moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1961 to continue his songwriting career, which had continued to gather steam while he was in the Army, thanks to [[Brenda Lee]]'s 1960 cover of his song \"That's All You Got to Do\".<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> He also became a popular session and tour guitarist.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> In 1962, he scored some success with two singles \"[[Goodnight Irene]]\" (as by Jerry Reed & the Hully Girlies, featuring a female vocal group) and \"Hully Gully Guitar\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> which found their way to [[Chet Atkins]] at [[RCA Victor]], who produced Reed's 1965 \"If I Don't Live Up to It\".\n\n===\"Guitar Man\"===\nIn July 1967, Reed had his best showing on the country chart (No. 53) with his self-penned \"[[Guitar Man (Jerry Reed song)|Guitar Man]]\", which [[Elvis Presley]] soon covered.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Reed's next single was \"Tupelo Mississippi Flash\", a comic tribute to Presley. Recorded on September 1, the song became his first [[Top 20]] hit, going to No. 15 on the chart. Coincidentally Presley came to Nashville to record nine days later on September 10, 1967, and one of the songs he became especially excited about was \"Guitar Man\".\n\nReed recalled how he was tracked down to play on the Presley session: \"I was out on the [[Cumberland River]] fishing, and I got a call from [[Felton Jarvis]] (then Presley's producer at [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]) He said, 'Elvis is down here. We've been trying to cut \"Guitar Man\" all day long. He wants it to sound like it sounded on your album.' I finally told him, 'Well, if you want it to sound like that, you're going have to get me in there to play guitar, because these guys [you're using in the studio] are [[Flatpicking|straight pickers]]. I [[fingerpicking|pick with my fingers]] and tune that guitar up all weird kind of ways.'\"<ref name=\"tennessean\">{{cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080902/TUNEIN/80902039|title='Bandit' star Reed dies at 71|newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]|date=September 2, 2008}}</ref>\n\nJarvis hired Reed to play on the session. \"I hit that intro, and [Elvis's] face lit up and here we went. Then after he got through that, he cut [my] \"[[U.S. Male]]\" at the same session. I was toppin' cotton, son.\" Reed also played the guitar for Elvis Presley's [[Big Boss Man (song)|\"Big Boss Man\"]] (1967), recorded in the same session.<ref>Ernst Jorgensen, ''Elvis Presley: A Life in Music'' (St. Martin's Press, 1998), pp. 234\u2013236</ref>\n\nOn January 15 and 16, 1968, Reed worked on a second Presley session, during which he played guitar on a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Too Much Monkey Business]]\", \"Stay Away\", and \"Goin' Home\" (two songs revolving around Presley's film ''[[Stay Away, Joe]]''), as well as another Reed composition, \"U.S. Male\" (Reed's quoted recollection of \"U.S. Male\" being recorded at the same session as \"Guitar Man\" being incorrect).<ref>Jorgensen, pp. 241\u2013242</ref>\n\nPresley also recorded two other Reed compositions: \"[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]\" in May 1971 for his [[He Touched Me (Elvis Presley album)|''He Touched Me'']] album, and \"Talk About The Good Times\" in December 1973, for a total of four.\n\n[[Johnny Cash]] also released \"[[A Thing Called Love (song)|A Thing Called Love]]\" as a single in 1971.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> It  reached No. 2 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] Country Singles Chart for North America and was also successful in Europe. It became the title track for a studio [[A Thing Called Love|album]] that he released the following spring.\n\n===1970s===\nAfter releasing the 1970 crossover hit \"[[Amos Moses]]\", a hybrid of rock, country, funk, and Cajun styles which reached No. 8 on the U.S. pop chart,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Reed teamed with Atkins for the duet LP ''[[Me & Jerry]]'', which earned the pair the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]]. During the 1970 television season, he was a regular on ''[[The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour]]'', and in 1971 he released his biggest hit, the chart-topper \"[[When You're Hot, You're Hot]]\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>KO buddy of the singer, who nevertheless sends him up the river for gambling. Aside from being a major crossover hit, \"When You're Hot, You're Hot\" earned Reed the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male]].\n\n\"When You're Hot, You're Hot\" was the title track of Reed's first solo album, reaching No. 9 Pop and No. 6 on Billboard's Easy Listening chart.

A year later he scored his second number one single with \"Lord, Mr. Ford\" (written by [[Deena Kaye Rose]]), from the album of the same name.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nAtkins, who frequently produced Reed's music, remarked that he had to encourage Reed to put instrumental numbers on his own albums, as Reed always considered himself more of a songwriter than a player. Atkins, however, thought Reed was a better [[fingerstyle]] player than he was himself; Reed, according to Atkins, helped him work out the fingerpicking for one of Atkins's biggest hits, \"[[Yakety Sax]]\".\n\nReed was featured in animated form in a December 9, 1972, episode of [[Hanna\u2013Barbera]]'s ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', \"The Phantom of the Country Music Hall\" (prod.

In one memorable appearance, Reed caught a particularly big [[largemouth bass]] and planned to have it preserved and mounted by a [[taxidermist]].

In 1984, \"The Best Of Families\" became a Top 50 hit; That same year, Downing released his final hit with the Team label, \"There\u2019ll Never Be A Better Night For Being Wrong\".\n\n===Vine Street years===\nIn 1987, Downing was signed by the [[Vine Street]] label, which released the \"Oh How Beautiful You Are\" (To Me) and \"Just One Night Won't Do,\" both of which hit the Top 70. Two years later, he was signed by Door Knob Records, with whom he produced the 1989 Top 100 hit, \"I Guess By Now.\"\n\nThe popular entertainer [[Fats Domino]] recorded two songs written by Downing: \"Mary, Oh Mary\" and \"Heartbreak Hill\". [[Bobby Bland|Bobby \"Blue\" Bland]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] have also recorded Downing's songs.\n\n===Later career===\nDowning built a five-decade career around his powerful singing voice and his hard-driving rockabilly-style piano. Downing's compilations of earlier work have been released throughout the world. In Europe, Crazy Music obtained exclusive rights for the original Team label recordings and released these in the form of a 2-CD compilation, ''Classic Collection''. This also contained some of Downing's earlier hits, including \"Mr. Jones.\"\n\nIn July 2002, he played the Oneida Casino's Rock'n'Roll Festival in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] with dozens of other rockabilly musicians.\n\nIn 2003, Downing released his first new album in more than a decade, ''One of A Kind''. The album received favourable radio and print reviews. It ranked third on ''American Roots Country'' and was commended for featuring 14 memorable tracks. He continued to give regular performances at the Grand Ole Opry. In 2000, he was nominated as a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.\n\nDowning continued to perform on more than 75 occasions per year in the remaining years of his life. He appeared at [[Ontario]]'s [[Havelock Country Jamboree]] with [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Roy Clark]]. In 2005, Downing postponed plans for a European tour that was set to begin on July 1 in Austria. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic [[leukemia]]. Soon after, he commenced [[chemotherapy]] treatment. Downing died on July 4, 2005.\n\n==Style==\nDowning's musical style found its roots in a variety of musical styles including [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], roots, [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[country music|country]]. He performed [[rhythm and blues]] and [[disco]] throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when he lived in [[Washington, D.C.]]  He eventually reclaimed his musical roots by turning to country music.\n\n== Producer ==\nIn additional to his work as a recording artist and performer, Downing also worked as a music producer. During late 1990s and early 2000s, he worked with several European musicians as an [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) agent. In 2003, he produced the album, ''Straight Beat'', with the Italian bluesman Edo 'Ndoss, which included songs written by Downing that he had not recorded himself. Downing's piano work on this album represented his last recording.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Album\n! <small>[[Top Country Albums|US Country]]</small>\n!

She was one of the few women working in the male-dominated rock and roll music field during the 1950s and one of country music's early female innovators. Martin was nicknamed the Female Elvis for her dance moves on stage, similar to those of [[Elvis Presley]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{More citations needed |date=June 2018}}\n\n===Early life and rise to fame===\nMartin was born in [[Sutherlin, Virginia]], east of [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]]. Her mother was a stage mother, and her father and uncle were both musicians. Before she was six, Martin was already singing and playing the guitar, inspired by [[Eddy Arnold]] and [[Hank Williams]]. \nOver the years, this resulted in statewide contests with over 200 contestants, which she won. As a result, Janis was asked to play on the same bill as [[Cowboy Copas]] and [[Sunshine Sue]].  Through them Martin became a member of the [[Old Dominion Barn Dance|Old Dominion Barndance]] on [[WRVA (AM)|WRVA]], which came out of Richmond every Saturday Night on CBS network. When she was in her mid-teens, she was appearing with country singers including Arnold, [[Hank Snow]], [[The Browns]] and [[Jim Reeves]].  She soon claimed she was tired of country music and began a rock and roll career.\n\n===Teen rock and roll star===\nThe WRVA station announcer, Carl Stutz, wrote a song titled \"Will You Willyum\", and asked Martin to sing the song live on stage that Saturday night so that he could make a demo tape to send to his publisher in New York. A week later, Stutz called Martin to tell her that [[RCA Victor]] was interested in recording \"Will You Willyum\". As it happened, the publisher offered \"Will You Willyum\" to [[Steve Sholes]], a producer at RCA Victor, and asked whether Sholes had an artist to record it. Apparently Sholes replied \"Well, who's the girl doin' the demo?\"\n\nAt age 15, Martin signed with RCA Victor in March 1956, just two months after Elvis Presley joined the label. She recorded \"Will You Willyum\" on March 8, 1956, backed by her own composition \"Drugstore Rock 'n Roll\".\n\nThe song became the biggest hit of her career, selling 750,000 records. Soon Martin was performing on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen]]''. She also appeared on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Jubilee USA]]'', and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in Nashville, Tennessee, becoming one of the younger performers to ever appear. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her Most Promising Female Vocalist that year.\n\nPresley and RCA were so impressed with Martin's stage presence that they dubbed her the Female Elvis.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=April 7, 1956 |title=Review spotlight on... |pages=44 |magazine=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZB8EAAAAMBAJ&dq=janis+martin+female+elvis&pg=PA44 |access-date=March 29, 2022}}</ref><ref>[[Sun Records]] also dubbed [[Jean Chapel]] the female Elvis Presley in 1956 when she began recording rockabilly songs including \"I Won't Be Rocking Tonight\".</ref> Presley sent a dozen red roses to her when she appeared at the RCA Victor convention in [[Miami, Florida]]. [[Colonel Tom Parker]], Elvis' manager, offered to take over her management seeing the potential of a successful double \"boy-girl\" bill. Just before, due to his extremely taxing touring schedule, Elvis had collapsed on stage in New York due to exhaustion. Safeguarding the young Janis Martin from this, her parents decided to not accept Parker's offer, and instead go with the head of the Old Dominion shows. RCA chose Martin to tour as a member of the [[Jim Reeves]] show and continued recording rock and roll and country material that ended up being successful on both charts, including \"My Boy Elvis\", \"Let's Elope Baby\", her cover of [[Roy Orbison]]'s song \"[[Ooby Dooby]]\", and \"[[Love Me to Pieces]]\".\n\nOn January 7, 1956, Martin eloped with her boyfriend, a paratrooper. She told her parents of her marriage only after her husband was safely shipped overseas in Germany. Her father tried to have it annulled because she was only 15 years old. Eventually, the matter was left, but Janis' mother ordered her to keep her marriage a secret to safeguard her career. In 1957, Janis went on a [[USO]] tour in Europe with [[Jim Reeves]], [[Del Wood]] (a pianist famous for performing the song \"Down Yonder\"), [[The Browns]], and [[Hank Locklin]]. Her husband got a 30-day leave and went on the road with her, which resulted in her getting pregnant with her son. Martin's teenage pregnancy caused RCA Victor to drop her in 1958. It was probably during this period that a 10\" LP album titled ''Janis and Elvis'' was released in South Africa. This was recalled immediately upon request from the U.S. because it suggested the idea that the two performers were singing together. Although [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] and [[Decca Records]] were interested, she signed with the Belgian label [[Palette Records|Palette]] in 1960.\n\n===Later career===\nBy 1960, Martin was on her second marriage, and her husband demanded she leave the music business. In the 1970s, she began performing again with her newly formed band, The Variations. In 1975, she was working for the [[Halifax, Virginia]], Police Department when music historian Dennis West tracked her down. Edd Bayes, a record collector from Maryland, asked Dennis for her address, which Dennis gave to him. He then coaxed her to appear locally and tell her story in ''Goldmine'' magazine. Martin toured through Europe as part of the rockabilly revival there, and in 1979 Bayes convinced RCA to pull four Martin songs from their vault, which were then released on [[Dog Gone Records]] in 1977. Edd Bayes took one of the songs that had been recorded twice (\"Love Me Love\") at different tempos and added the 'cha cha' to the title. In the 1980s, the [[Bear Family]] label gathered Martin's complete record history with the compilation album ''The Female Elvis''. Since the early 1980s Janis started performing again at Rockabilly shows through Europe and the US. One of her live shows was released on a CD called ''Here I Am'' on [[Hydra Records]].  In 1995, Martin appeared on [[Rosie Flores]]'s ''Rockabilly Filly'' album for [[HighTone Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockabilly Filly Overview|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rockabilly-filly-mw0000177263|website=AllMusic.com|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Flores recorded an album with Martin six months before her death, but it was not released until September 18, 2012, as [[The Blanco Sessions]] by [[Cow Island Music]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Janis Martin, 'The Female Elvis,' Returns|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/30/161968431/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-returns|website=NPR Music|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Flores|first1=Rosie|title=JANIS MARTIN \" The Female Elvis\", Final Recording Sessions|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1383637978/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-final-recording-sess|website=Kickstarter|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nMartin died from cancer on September 3, 2007, at [[Duke University Medical Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].

His 1956 top ten hit with his backing band [[the Blue Caps]], \"[[Be-Bop-a-Lula]]\", is considered a significant early example of rockabilly.<ref name=pc8/> His chart career was brief, especially in his home country of the US, where he notched three top 40 hits in 1956 and 1957, and never charted in the top 100 again.  In the UK, he was a somewhat bigger star, racking up eight top 40 hits from 1956 to 1961.\n\nVincent was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He is sometimes referred to by his somewhat unusual nickname/moniker the \"Screaming End\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-10-12 |title=Gene Vincent: The hero before The Beatles |url=https://faroutmagazine.co.uk/gene-vincent-heror-the-beatles/ |access-date=2022-05-27 |website=faroutmagazine.co.uk |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|title=GENE VINCENT|first=Ian|last=Chaddock|website=Vivelerock.net|access-date=May 22, 2021|archive-date=December 28, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211228151827/https://vivelerock.net/gene-vincent/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nCraddock was born February 11, 1935, in [[Norfolk, Virginia]],<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |date=1997 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |isbn=1-85227-745-9 |editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |edition=Concise |page=1218}}</ref> to Mary Louise and Ezekiah Jackson Craddock.<ref name=\"musicianguide.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://musicianguide.com/biographies/1608000576/Gene-Vincent.html|title=Gene Vincent Biography|website=Musicianguide.com|access-date=May 22, 2021}}</ref>  His musical influences included [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[gospel music|gospel]]. His favorite composition was [[Egmont (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Egmont overture]]. He showed his first real interest in music while his family lived in Munden Point (now [[Virginia Beach]]), in [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne County]], Virginia, near the [[North Carolina]] line, where they ran a country store. He received his first guitar at the age of twelve as a gift from a friend.\n\nCraddock's father volunteered to serve in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] and patrolled American coastal waters to protect Allied shipping against German [[U-boat]]s during [[World War II]]. Craddock's mother maintained the general store in Munden Point. His parents moved the family to Norfolk, the home of a large naval base, and opened a general store and sailors' tailoring shop.\n\nCraddock dropped out of school in 1952, at the age of seventeen, and enlisted in the [[United States Navy]]. As he was under the age of enlistment, his parents signed the forms allowing him to enter. He completed boot camp and joined the fleet as a crewman aboard the fleet oiler {{USS|Chukawan|AO-100|6}}, with a two-week training period in the repair ship {{USS|Amphion|AR-13|6}}, before returning to the ''Chukawan''. He never saw combat but completed a [[Korean War]] deployment. He sailed home from Korean waters aboard the battleship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|6}} but was not part of the ship's company.\n\nCraddock planned a career in the Navy and, in 1955, used his $612 re-enlistment bonus to buy a new [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph]] motorcycle. On July 4, 1955, while he was in Norfolk, his left leg was shattered in an auto crash.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Henderson|first=Derek|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70671058|title=Gene Vincent: a companion|year=2005|publisher=Spent Brothers Productions|isbn=0-9519416-7-4|location=Southampton|page=3|oclc=70671058}}</ref> He refused to allow the leg to be amputated, and the leg was saved, but the injury left him with a limp and pain.

His best known record was \"Ten Long Fingers\", recorded in 1958.\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Dallas, Texas]], he was encouraged to be an entertainer as a child.  He initially learned the [[steel guitar]],<ref name=Morrison>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qAHvUO5GknMC&dq=%22joe+poovey%22&pg=PA158  Craig Morrison, ''Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly music and its makers'', University of Illinois Press, 1996, p.158]</ref> and made his first recordings at the age of 10.  Two years later, in 1953, he formed a group, the Hillbilly Boys, and started weekly broadcasts on radio station [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], soon followed by work as a disc jockey on the \"[[Big D Jamboree]]\" radio show. He also recorded several Christmas-themed songs, including \"Santa's Helper\", written by his father Bernice Poovey.  After opening a show for [[Elvis Presley]] in 1955, he instantly changed his musical style from traditional country music to rockabilly.  In 1957, as '''Jumping Joe Poovey''', he recorded \"Move Around\" on the [[Dixie Records|Dixie]] label, produced by Jim Shell in Dallas.  It was followed the next year by \"Ten Long Fingers\", a tribute to [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], on which he was credited as \"Groove Joe Poovey\" {{sic}}.   Although the record was later acclaimed as a classic rockabilly number, featuring piano by local prodigy C.B. Oliver, it was only locally successful, and Poovey remained working in the Dallas and [[Fort Worth]] area, recording occasionally for small local labels.<ref name=hall>[http://rockabillyhall.com/JoePoovey1.html  Groovey Joe Poovey at the Rockabilly Hall of Fame]</ref><ref name=tsha>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpo69  The Handbook of Texas Online: Groovey Joe Poovey]</ref><ref name=blackcat>[http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/groovey_joe_poovey.htm  Groovey Joe Poovey at Black Cat Rockabilly]</ref><ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-poovey-p366176/biography  Biography by Jason Ankeny at Allmusic.com]</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s he returned to playing country music and worked as a songwriter, his songs being recorded by such musicians as [[George Jones]] and [[Johnny Paycheck]].  In 1966, using the pseudonym '''Johnny Dallas''', he recorded \"Heart Full of Love\", which reached no. 62 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]].  However, follow-ups failed to match its success, and he retired from performing to concentrate on his work as a disc jockey, working on various radio stations in the Dallas \u2013 Fort Worth area.  In the 1970s, his earlier records began to be recognised by rockabilly fans in Europe, where he first performed in 1980, and unreleased recordings from the 1950s were made available.  He also began recording again, releasing several new singles under the name '''Texas Joe Poovey'''.  At the same time, he worked as a chauffeur on the film set of the ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' TV series.<ref name=hall/><ref name=tsha/><ref name=blackcat/><ref name=allmusic/>\n\nHe continued to make regular visits to Britain and Europe, performing both country and rockabilly music, into the 1990s.  Shortly before the release of a retrospective album, ''Golden Grooves'', he died at the age of 57 from a heart condition.<ref name=hall/><ref name=tsha/><ref name=blackcat/>\n\n==External links==\n* [http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/artist.php?key=poov1000  Discography]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Poovey, Joe}}\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:1998 deaths]]\n[[Category:American country singers]]\n[[Category:American country songwriters]]\n[[Category:American rockabilly musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Dallas]]\n[[Category:Radio personalities from Dallas]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]\n[[Category:20th-century American musicians]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singers]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

In 1957, the band signed with [[Imperial Records]], where they recorded \"All Night Long\" (b/w \"Red Cadillac and a Black Mustache\") and \"Amarillo Blues.\"<ref name=TSHA/>\n\nThat same year, the band appeared on the ''[[Town Hall Party]]'' in Los Angeles, and appeared in the movie ''[[Carnival Rock]]'', where they backed up [[David Houston (singer)|David Houston]].<ref name=TSHA/>\n\nThe following year, having been dropped by Imperial Records, Luman signed with [[Capitol Records]],<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> where he released \"Try Me\" and \"I Know My Baby Cares.\"  Capitol Records wanted Luman to change his name, which he refused to do, so he left the record label and signed with [[Warner Bros.

He is best known for having hosted ''[[Hee Haw]]'', a nationally televised country variety show, from 1969 to 1997. Clark was an important and influential figure in [[country music]], both as a performer and in helping to popularize the genre.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Clark frequently guest-hosted for [[Johnny Carson]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and enjoyed a 30-million viewership for ''Hee Haw''. Clark was highly regarded and renowned as a guitarist, [[banjo]] player, and [[fiddle]]r.  He was skilled in the traditions of many genres, including classical guitar, country music, [[Latin music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and pop.  He had hit songs as a pop vocalist (e.g., \"[[Hier encore|Yesterday, When I Was Young]]\" and \"Thank God and Greyhound\"), and his instrumental skill had an enormous effect on generations of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and country musicians. He became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 1987, and, in 2009, was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]]. He published his autobiography, ''My Life\u2014in Spite of Myself'', in 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-671-86434-7 |title=Nonfiction Book Review: 'My Life in Spite of Myself' |date=February 28, 1994 |magazine=[[Publishers Weekly]] |access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nClark was born April 15, 1933, in [[Meherrin, Virginia]],{{sfn|''Current Biography Yearbook''|1979|page=83}} one of five children<ref name=Thanki>{{cite news| url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/11/15/roy-clark-dead-85/1978910002/| title=Roy Clark, 'Hee Haw' co-host, Country Music Hall of Fame member, dies at 85| last=Thanki| first=Juli| newspaper=[[The Tennessean]]| location=Nashville| access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref> born to Hester Linwood Clark and Lillian Clark (Oliver).{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} His father was a tobacco farmer.{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} He spent his childhood in Meherrin and New York City, where his father moved the family to take jobs during the [[Great Depression]].{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} When Clark was 11 years old, his family moved to a home on 1st Street SE in the [[Washington Highlands, Washington, D.C.|Washington Highlands]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C.,{{sfn|Clark|Eliot|1994|page=84}} after his father found work at the [[Washington Navy Yard]].{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}}\n\nClark's father was a semi-professional musician who played [[banjo]], [[violin|fiddle]], and guitar,{{sfn|Kingsbury|2004|page=95}} and his mother played piano.{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} The first musical instrument Clark ever played was a four-string cigar box with a ukulele neck attached to it,{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} which he picked up in elementary school.<ref name=rcinterview>{{cite magazine| title=The Roy Clark Interview| magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| date=December 28, 1985| pages=RC-4, RC-12| access-date=November 15, 2018| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uyQEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Roy%20Clark%22%20%22National%20Banjo%20Championship%22&pg=PT77}}</ref> His father taught Clark to play guitar{{sfn|Flint|Nelson|1993|page=57}} when Roy was 14 years old, and soon Clark was playing banjo, guitar, and [[mandolin]].{{sfn|Lornell|2012|page=369}} \"Guitar was my real love, though,\" Clark later said. \"I never copied anyone, but I was certainly influenced by them; especially by [[George Barnes (musician)|George Barnes]].

[[Country-western]] music was widely derided by Clark's schoolmates, leaving him socially isolated. Clowning around, he felt, helped him to fit in again. Clark used humor as a musician as well, and it was not until the mid 1960s that he felt confident enough to perform in public without using humor in his act.<ref name=rcinterview />\n\nThe D.C. area had a number of country-western music venues at the time.

By all accounts the singer was not held in much regard by Phillips, but Feathers often made the audacious claim that he had arranged \"[[That's All Right]]\" and \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\" for [[Elvis Presley]]. He also claimed that his \"We're Getting Closer (To Being Apart)\" had been intended to be Elvis' sixth single for Sun.

When his King contract ran out he still continued to perform, although Feathers thought there was a conspiracy to keep his music from gaining the popularity it deserved.<ref name=bc/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he performed at times at new music nightclubs like the Antenna Club in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], sharing the bill with [[rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] bands like [[Tav Falco's Panther Burns]], who, as devoted fans of Feathers, had introduced him to their label's president.<ref name= \"Panther\">{{cite news |last=Sprague |first=David |url= https://variety.com/2001/music/reviews/panther-burns-1200467792/ |title=Panther Burns |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 17, 2001 |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe released his ''New Jungle Fever'' album in 1987 and ''Honkey Tonk Man'' in 1988, featuring the lead guitar work of his son, Bubba Feathers.

Since the 1950s, she has recorded and released music in the genres of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. She was among the first women to have a career in rock and roll, recording a series of 1950s singles that helped give her the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]] \"The Queen of Rockabilly\". She is also counted among the first female stars in the genre of country music.\n\nJackson began performing as a child and later had her own radio show in Oklahoma City. She was then discovered by country singer [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], who helped her secure a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] in 1954. At Decca, Jackson had her first hit single with the country song \"[[You Can't Have My Love]]\". She then began touring the following year with [[Elvis Presley]]. The two briefly dated and Presley encouraged her to record in the [[Rockabilly]] style. In 1956, Jackson signed with [[Capitol Records]] where she was given full permission to record both country and Rockabilly. The label released a string of Jackson's rock  singles, including \"[[Fujiyama Mama]]\", \"Mean Mean Man\" and the top 40 hit \"[[Let's Have a Party]]\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Jackson moved back to the country genre and had several charting singles during the decade. This included \"[[Right or Wrong (Wanda Jackson song)|Right or Wrong]]\", \"[[In the Middle of a Heartache]]\", \"[[Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine]]\" and \"[[A Woman Lives for Love]]\". In addition, she also recorded several selections for the German language market overseas. In 1965, the German single \"[[Santo Domingo (song)|Santo Domingo]]\" reached number one on the Austrian pop chart. After re-discovering [[Christianity]] in 1971, Jackson made [[gospel music]] a priority in her career. She left Capitol Records in 1973 and signed with [[Word Records]] to focus more on the gospel circuit. Over the next two decades, she released a series of gospel discs.\n\nIn 1984, Jackson was sought out by European promoters to tour overseas. The same year, she released her first rock album in two decades and launched a new career in the genre. In the 1990s, her rock records were noticed again by American audiences and she began touring alongside fellow Rockabilly artist [[Rosie Flores]]. During this period, she released several commercially acclaimed albums in the rock and roll style, including ''[[Heart Trouble (album)|Heart Trouble]]'' (2003) and ''[[I Remember Elvis]]'' (2006). Following her 2009 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Jackson collaborated with musician [[Jack White]] to record the commercially successful ''[[The Party Ain't Over]]''. For several years, she kept a busy touring schedule before announcing her retirement from performing in 2019. She released her 32nd and final studio project, ''[[Encore (2021 Wanda Jackson album)|Encore]]'', in 2021.\n\n==Early life==\nJackson was the only child born to parents Tom and Nellie Jackson in [[Maud, Oklahoma]].<ref name=\"Oklahoma\">{{cite web |last1=Carney |first1=George O. |title=Jackson, Wanda LaVonne: The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |website=Oklahoma History.org |access-date=9 July 2021 |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184947/https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |url-status=live }}</ref> Her father worked multiple jobs, including a gas station attendant and delivery truck driver.

Nellie Jackson often had Jackson sing while she was out of sight, to ensure her daughter was accounted for.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=6-8}} In Los Angeles, Jackson was introduced to [[western swing]] music.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She enjoyed hearing music by popular western acts like [[Bob Wills]] and [[Rose Maddox]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=8-10}} At age six, her father introduced Jackson to the guitar. She also took guitar lessons and was soon skillful enough to play it alongside her father.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}\n\nIn the mid 1940s, the family relocated to [[Bakersfield, California]] where Tom Jackson took a job as a [[barber]]. She also took piano lessons and continued to play the guitar.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}} It was during this period that she began having trouble with academics. Jackson recalled the experience in her book: \"All I wanted to do was sing and play music, and it was impossible for me to sit still,\" she recounted in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=15}} When Jackson was nine, the family moved back to their home state, this time living in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Her father found employment as a taxi cab driver and her mother worked on an air force base.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}}\n\nIn Oklahoma City, Jackson sang in the local Baptist church and engaged in more performance opportunities.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She auditioned for the local radio station, KPLR, after being peer-pressured by friends.

On Thompson's show, Jackson sang \"Blue Yodel No. 6\" backed by his band the Brazos Valley Boys. The performance led to a regular gig singing alongside [[Merl Lindsay]]'s country band.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=40-44}} Jackson was always performing, and at times neglected her social life. \"[Wanda] never had time for dates, nothing like that. Just that guitar \u2013 that's all she thought about,\" a high school friend recalled.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}\n\n==Career==\n===1953\u20131955: Country beginnings===\nJackson also continued working with Hank Thompson. In 1953, she appeared with him regularly on his local television program and on a similar program for 30 minutes hosted by KPLR. Thompson also recorded Jackson on several demonstration recordings in hopes they would be heard by major record labels. Thompson was also attempting to get his band member Billy Gray a recording contract, and had the pair sing several duets.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} Jackson was supposed to be signed by Thompson's label, [[Capitol Records]], but was rejected by producer [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. \"Girls don't sell records!\" he told Thompson.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}} In her book, Jackson recalled hearing Nelson's statement: \"I recognize that Ken wasn't being sexist, so much as he was thinking about business. But it still gave me a little nudge to prove him wrong!\"{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59}}\n\n[[File:Wanda Jackson--1956.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jackson was known for her spaghetti strap dresses, designed by her mother.]]\nInstead Thompson contacted [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]] of [[Decca Records]], who was interested in signing Jackson and Billy Gray.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} In 1954, while still high school, Jackson signed with the label.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201-202}} In March 1954, the Jackson family traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] where she recorded her first Decca sessions backed by Thompson's band. She cut several solo sides, along with the Billy Gray duet, \"[[You Can't Have My Love]]\". Jackson disliked the song, but Thompson convinced her to record it.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=60-62}} It was soon released as Jackson's debut single on Decca and became a major hit, climbing to the number eight spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Upon Decca's encouragement, Jackson and Gray recorded a second duet, titled \"If You Don't Somebody Else Will\". Released as a single, the song was a commercial failure due to a competing version by [[Jimmy & Johnny]] that reached the charts.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\" />{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=64}}\n\nInstead of touring, Jackson started her senior year in fall 1954 and finished high school. She was part of the school band and acted in the musical ''[[Anything Goes]]''.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=66-68}} In March 1955, she returned to the recording studio, this time working with Paul Cohen at the Decca studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].

He sold appliances while studying to be a radio announcer. At night, he played with guitarist [[Luther Perkins]] and bassist [[Marshall Grant]]. Perkins and Grant were known as the [[The Tennessee Three|Tennessee Two]]. Cash worked up the courage to visit the [[Sun Records]] studio, hoping to get a recording contract.<ref>{{cite web|title= Johnny Cash Biography and Interview |website=Achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/johnny-cash/#interview}}</ref> He auditioned for [[Sam Phillips]] by singing mostly gospel songs, only to learn from the producer that he no longer recorded gospel music. Phillips was rumored to have told Cash to \"go home and sin, then come back with a song I can sell\". In a 2002 interview, Cash denied that Phillips made any such comment.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=832786|title=The Man in Black's Musical Journey Continues|newspaper=NPR|access-date=February 9, 2010}}</ref> Cash eventually won over the producer with new songs delivered in his early rockabilly style. In 1955, Cash made his first recordings at Sun, \"[[Hey Porter]]\" and \"[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]\", which were released in late June and met with success on the country [[hit parade]].\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips while [[Carl Perkins]] was in the studio cutting new tracks, with [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] backing him on piano. Cash was also in the studio, and the four started an [[impromptu]] [[jam session]]. Phillips left the tapes running and the recordings, almost half of which were gospel songs, survived. They have since been released under the title ''[[Million Dollar Quartet]]''. In ''Cash: the Autobiography'', Cash wrote that he was the farthest from the microphone and sang in a higher pitch to blend in with Elvis.\n\nCash's next record, \"Folsom Prison Blues\", made the country top five. His \"[[I Walk the Line]]\" became number one on the country charts and entered the pop charts top 20. \"[[Home of the Blues]]\" followed, recorded in July 1957. That same year, Cash became the first Sun artist to release a [[LP record|long-playing album]]. Although he was Sun's most consistently selling and prolific artist at that time, Cash felt constrained by his contract with the small label. Phillips did not want Cash to record gospel and was paying him a 3% royalty rather than the standard rate of 5%. Presley had already left Sun, and Cash felt that Phillips was focusing most of his attention and promotion on Lewis.\n\nIn 1958, Cash left Phillips to sign a lucrative offer with [[Columbia Records]]. His single \"[[Don't Take Your Guns to Town]]\" became one of his biggest hits. He recorded a collection of gospel songs for his second album for Columbia. However, Cash left behind such a backlog of recordings with Sun that Phillips continued to release new singles and albums featuring previously unreleased material until as late as 1964. Cash was in the unusual position of having new releases out on two labels concurrently. Sun's 1960 release, a cover of \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]]\", made it to number 13 on the C&W charts.{{Efn|When [[RCA Victor]] signed Presley, it had also bought his Sun Records masters, but when Cash departed for Columbia, Phillips retained the rights to the singer's Sun masters. Columbia eventually licensed some of these recordings for release on compilations after Cash's death.}}\n[[File:Johnny Cash - Cash Box 1957.jpg|thumb|Cash on the cover of ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]]'' magazine, September 7, 1957]]\nEarly in his career, Cash was given the teasing nickname \"the Undertaker\" by fellow artists because of his habit of wearing black clothes.

June later recalled admiring him from afar during these tours. In the 1960s, he appeared on [[Pete Seeger]]'s short-lived television series ''[[Rainbow Quest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandmimi.com/rainbowquest.html|title=Rainbow Quest|website=Richardandmimi.com|date=February 26, 1966|access-date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> He also acted in, and wrote and sang the opening theme for, a 1961 film entitled ''[[Five Minutes to Live]]''. It was later re-released as ''Door-to-door Maniac''.\n\nCash's career was handled by [[Saul Holiff]], a [[London, Ontario]], promoter.

For a brief time, he shared an apartment in Nashville with [[Waylon Jennings]], who was deeply addicted to amphetamines. Cash would use the stimulants to stay awake during tours. Friends joked about his \"nervousness\" and erratic behavior, many ignoring the warning signs of his worsening [[drug addiction]].\n\nAlthough he was in many ways spiraling out of control, Cash could still deliver hits due to his frenetic creativity.

Despite landing in jail seven times for [[misdemeanor]]s, he was held only one night each time. On May 11, 1965, he was arrested in [[Starkville, Mississippi]], for [[trespassing]] late at night onto private property to pick flowers.

His ''[[Bitter Tears]]'' (1964) was devoted to spoken word and songs addressing the plight of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and mistreatment by the government. While initially reaching charts, this album met with resistance from some fans and radio stations, which rejected its controversial take on social issues. \n\nIn 2011, a book was published about it, leading to a re-recording of the songs by contemporary artists and the making of a documentary film about Cash's efforts with the album. This film was aired on PBS in February and November 2016. His ''[[Sings the Ballads of the True West]]'' (1965) was an experimental double record, mixing authentic frontier songs with Cash's spoken narration.\n\nReaching a low with his severe drug addiction and destructive behavior, Cash and his first wife divorced after having separated in 1962. Some venues cancelled his performances, but he continued to find success.

Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. He was jailed for the night in [[LaFayette, Georgia]]. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving him a long talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school.<ref>{{Citation|page=5A|place=LaFayette, Georgia|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KtkvAAAAIBAJ&pg=3615,6191621|newspaper=Rome News Tribune|date=August 14, 1970|title=12 000 at LaFayette show}}</ref> \n\nReflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: \"I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me.\"<ref>Gross (2004). p. 34</ref> June, Maybelle, and Ezra Carter moved into Cash's mansion for a month to help him get off drugs.

In the mid-1980s, he recorded and toured with [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] as [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|the Highwaymen]], making three hit albums, which were released beginning with the originally titled ''Highwayman'' in 1985, followed by ''Highwaymen 2'' in 1990, and concluding with ''Highwaymen&nbsp;\u2013 The Road Goes On Forever'' in 1995.\n\nDuring that period, Cash appeared in a number of television films. In 1981, he starred in ''[[The Pride of Jesse Hallam]]'', winning fine reviews for a film that called attention to adult [[illiteracy]]. In 1983, he appeared as a heroic sheriff in ''[[Murder in Coweta County (film)|Murder in Coweta County]]'', based on a real-life [[Murder in Coweta County|Georgia murder]] case, which co-starred [[Andy Griffith]] as his nemesis.\n\nCash relapsed into addiction after being administered painkillers for a serious abdominal injury in 1983 caused by an incident in which he was kicked and wounded by an [[ostrich]] on his farm.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|title=Johnny Cash: The Rebel|website=Exclaim.ca|place=Canada|page=3|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426225724/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=439|archive-date=April 26, 2005}}</ref>\n\nAt a hospital visit in 1988, this time to watch over Waylon Jennings (who was recovering from a heart attack), Jennings suggested that Cash have himself checked into the hospital for his own heart condition. Doctors recommended preventive heart surgery, and Cash underwent [[coronary artery bypass surgery|double bypass surgery]] in the same hospital. Both recovered, although Cash refused to use any prescription painkillers, fearing a relapse into dependency. Cash later claimed that during his operation, he had what is called a \"[[near-death experience]]\".\n\n{{Anchor|Chicken in Black}}\nIn 1984, Cash released a self-parody recording titled \"[[The Chicken in Black]]\" about Cash's brain being transplanted into a chicken and Cash receiving a bank robber's brain in return. Biographer Robert Hilburn, in his 2013 book ''Johnny Cash: The Life'', disputes the claim made that Cash chose to record an intentionally poor song in protest of Columbia's treatment of him. On the contrary, Hilburn writes, it was Columbia that presented Cash with the song, which Cash \u2013 who had previously scored major chart hits with comedic material such as \"A Boy Named Sue\" and \"One Piece at a Time\" \u2013 accepted enthusiastically, performing the song live on stage and filming a comedic music video in which he dresses up in a superhero-like bank-robber costume. According to Hilburn, Cash's enthusiasm for the song waned after Waylon Jennings told Cash he looked \"like a buffoon\" in the music video (which was showcased during Cash's 1984 Christmas TV special), and Cash subsequently demanded that Columbia withdraw the music video from broadcast and recall the single from stores\u2014interrupting its bona fide chart success\u2014and termed the venture \"a fiasco\".<ref>Robert Hilburn, ''Johnny Cash: The Life''.

During this time, he recorded an album of new versions of some of his best-known Sun and Columbia hits, as well as ''[[Water from the Wells of Home]]'', a duets album that paired him with, among others, his children [[Rosanne Cash]] and [[John Carter Cash]], as well as [[Paul McCartney]]. A [[Johnny Cash Country Christmas|one-off Christmas album]] recorded for [[Delta Records]] followed his Mercury contract.\n\nThough Cash would never have another chart hit from 1991 until his death, his career was rejuvenated in the 1990s, leading to popularity with an audience which was not traditionally considered interested in country music. In 1988, British post-punk musicians [[Marc Riley]] (formerly of [[The Fall (band)|the Fall]]) and [[Jon Langford]] ([[the Mekons]]) put together '''Til Things Are Brighter'', a [[tribute album]] featuring mostly British-based indie-rock acts' interpretations of Cash's songs. Cash was enthusiastic about the project, telling Langford that it was a \"morale booster\"; Rosanne Cash later said \"he felt a real connection with those musicians and very validated ... It was very good for him: he was in his element. He absolutely understood what they were tapping into, and loved it\".

He had previously moved his parents to the area to run a small trailer park called the Johnny Cash Trailer Park. His drinking led to several run-ins with local law enforcement.

When asked why most of his songs were positive in their outlook, McDaniel told the ''[[Anchorage Daily News]]'' that \"there's enough things in the world to keep you bummed out\" and that his fans did not want to \"hear me singing something that's gonna bum 'em out some more.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tIIgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=R8AEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2818,1429291&dq=mel+mcdaniel+real+good+feel+good+song&hl=en|title=Good Ol' Boy|last=Perala|first=Andrew|date=October 19, 1989|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|access-date=June 14, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life===\nMcDaniel was born in [[Checotah, Oklahoma]],<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=249}}</ref> a small town in [[McIntosh County, Oklahoma]], and grew up in [[Okmulgee, Oklahoma]]. He was inspired to play music after seeing [[Elvis Presley]] on television. His first interest in music was when he learned the trumpet in the fourth grade, but he soon learned the guitar.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> At age 14, he taught himself the guitar chords to \"[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie and Johnny]]\" and performed at a high-school talent contest. He made his professional debut at age 15 performing in a talent contest at Okmulgee High School. While in high school, he played in several local bands, and after graduation, began working as a musician in [[Tulsa]] clubs. While in Tulsa, he recorded several singles for local label [[J.J. Cale]] and wrote and produced his first single, \"Lazy Me\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===Career===\nAfter marrying his high school sweetheart, McDaniel began performing in Tulsa. From there, he had an unsuccessful trip to Nashville, followed by quite a bit of success in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], performing at clubs among the oil fields.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> After two years there, he returned to Nashville and landed a job as a demo singer and songwriter with Combine Music. With the help of music publisher [[Bob Beckham]], McDaniel signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1976 and released his first single, \"Have a Dream on Me\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nHis career finally took off with \"[[Louisiana Saturday Night]]\" in 1981, and in early 1985 he scored his only number one hit with \"[[Baby's Got Her Blue Jeans On]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Other Top 10 hits include \"[[Right in the Palm of Your Hand]]\" (later covered by [[Alan Jackson]] in 1999), \"[[Take Me to the Country (song)|Take Me to the Country]]\", \"[[Big Ole Brew]]\", \"[[I Call It Love (Mel McDaniel song)|I Call It Love]]\", and \"[[Real Good Feel Good Song]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nMcDaniel became a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on January 11, 1986, and made frequent appearances on the show.\n\nMcDaniel was inducted into the [[Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame]] in 2006, along with induction classmate [[Leon Russell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oklahomamusichalloffame.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/17/Default.aspx |title=By Year |access-date=April 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429194034/http://www.oklahomamusichalloffame.com/Inductees/BYYEAR/tabid/86/ItemID/17/Default.aspx |archive-date=April 29, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Later years, health, and death===\nOn November 14, 1996, he had a nearly fatal fall into an orchestra pit while he was performing at the Heymann Performing Arts Center in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].

In 1946 his family moved to [[Dallas]], where he played on [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]]'s ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. By 1951 he was playing on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''; that year he signed to [[Capitol Records]] and released his first single, \"I Keep the Blues All the Time\", as Jimmy Lee. Capitol released seven further singles from Fautheree before dropping him in 1952. Despite never charting, the recordings have been cited as influential on later rockabilly artists, including [[James Burton]].\n\nFautheree subsequently found work as a [[session musician]] for musicians such as [[Faron Young]] and [[Webb Pierce]]. Along with [[\"Country\" Johnny Mathis]], he performed on ''Louisiana Hayride'' as [[Jimmy & Johnny]], and released a charting single under the \"Jimmy Lee & Johnny Mathis\" moniker on [[Chess Records]], 1954's \"If You Don't, Somebody Else Will\". Fautheree left Mathis to work with Wayne Walker, a partnership that lasted only four months but yielded a few recordings. Following this he began recording with his brother Lynn, again under the name Jimmy & Johnny; they signed to [[Decca Records]], but by 1957 the pair had moved back to Dallas.\n\nFautheree went back to solo recording, recording in [[New Orleans]] in 1958 at J&M Studio. He recorded briefly with Mathis again between 1958 and 1959. Some self-released material and a single on [[Paula Records]] brought him into 1960, and throughout the next decade Fautheree worked increasingly in the genre of [[gospel music]].\n\nBy the 1970s Fautheree had left the business, working in [[asbestos]] removal. In 1995, he returned to music with Mathis, recording a new single, \"It Won't Be Much Longer\", together. He played both in the U.S. and abroad in the 2000s, and released a full-length album with [[Deke Dickerson]] entitled ''I Found the Doorknob''. Shortly after the album was complete he died of [[cancer]] in Dallas on June 29, 2004.\n\nHis mother's name was Lodema Hammonds, the daughter of Mack Hammonds of Maud, Texas, who was a descendant of [[Phillip Hamman]], the Savior of the Greenbrier.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"350\" | Title\n! width=\"150\" | Record label\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Love Is Hard To Understand / I Keep the Blues All The Time'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Go Ahead and Go / Knocking On Your Front Door'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Lips That Kiss So Sweetly / I\u2019ve Got A Broken Heart'' || Capitol Records \n|----\n| 1952 || ''Suspense / Warm Warm Kisses'' || Capitol Records \n|----\n| 1952 || ''I\u2019m Diggin\u2019 A Hole To Bury My Heart / Kisses By Mail'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1952 || ''Blowin\u2019 And Goin\u2019 / Mistakes'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1953 || ''How About A Date / Cryin\u2019 Won\u2019t Change My Mind'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1955 || ''Lips That Kiss So Sweetly / Love Me'' (with Wayne Walker) || Chess Records\n|----\n| 1958 || ''Teenage Wedding / Baby It\u2019s Love'' (as ''Johnny Angel'') || Vin Records\n|----\n| 1966 || ''Git / Can\u2019t Find The Doorknob'' || Paula Records  \n|----\n| 1966 || ''Keep Me In Mind / Belle Of Monterrey'' || Paula Records\n|----\n| 1974 || ''Project X-9 (Instr.) / I\u2019m The Laziest Man In The World'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| 197? || ''If You Want To Be Saved / Fellowship With Jesus'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| 197? || ''I Just Can\u2019t Keep On / One Day Smiling'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| unknown || ''This Ole House / Heaven Is Only Knee High'' || Little Richie Records\n|----\n| 1963 || '''''EP''''' \n* ''Nobody Knows Where You Go''\n* ''Please Talk To My Heart''\n* ''Taffy Town'' (by Fran Powers)\n* ''Goin\u2019 Steady'' (by Fran Powers)\n|| Towne House Records\n|}\n\n==References==\n*[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p75324/biography|pure_url=yes}} Jimmy Lee Fautheree] at [[Allmusic]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fautheree, Jimmy Lee}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American rockabilly musicians]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Arkansas]]\n[[Category:American session musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Smackover, Arkansas]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Arkansas]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

From age eight he starred alongside his family in the radio and television series ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''. In 1957, he began a long and successful career as a popular recording artist. \n\nHis fame as both a recording artist and television star also led to a motion picture role co-starring alongside [[John Wayne]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Walter Brennan]], and [[Angie Dickinson]] in [[Howard Hawks]]'s [[Western (genre)|western]] feature film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). He placed 54 songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and its predecessors between 1957 and 1973, including \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\" in 1958, which was the first number one song on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's then-newly created [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100 chart]]. He recorded 17 additional top ten hits and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on January 21, 1987.{{sfn|Whitburn|1983|p=491}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=284}} In 1996 Nelson was ranked No. 49 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.<ref name=\"fifty\" />\n\nNelson began his entertainment career in 1949, playing himself in the radio sitcom series ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet''. In 1952, he appeared in his first feature film, ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]''. In 1957, he recorded his first single (\"I'm Walkin' b/w \"A Teenager's Romance\", Verve 10047X4S), debuted as a singer on the television version of the sitcom, and released the No. 1 album ''[[Ricky (album)|Ricky]]''. In 1958, Nelson released his first #1 single, \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\", and in 1959 received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Most Promising Male Newcomer\" after starring in ''Rio Bravo''. A few films followed, and when the television series was cancelled in 1966, Nelson made occasional appearances as a guest star on various television programs. In his twenties, he moved away from the pop music of his youth and began to perform in a [[country rock]] style.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |title=Rick Nelson Biography |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2022-11-23 |archive-date=November 24, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124044719/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |url-status=live }}</ref> After recording several albums with mostly [[session musician]]s, most of which flopped, he formed the Stone Canyon Band in 1969 and experienced a career resurgence, buoyed by the live album ''[[In Concert at the Troubadour, 1969]]'' and had a surprise hit with 1972's \"[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]\", which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. His comeback was short-lived, however, as his record label was bought out and folded, and his followup albums were not well promoted by his new label. He continued to perform live and take small television roles through the 1970s, though his label dropped him by the end of the decade. He released two more albums, with unimpressive results, before [[Death of Ricky Nelson|his death in a plane crash]] on New Year's Eve, 1985.\n\nNelson was married once, to [[Kristin Nelson|Sharon Kristin Harmon]], from 1963 until their divorce in 1982. They had four children: actress [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Nelson]], twin sons and musicians [[Gunnar Nelson (musician)|Gunnar]] and [[Matthew Nelson (musician)|Matthew]], and actor Sam.\n\n==Early life==\nNelson was born on May 8, 1940, in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=2, 16\u201317}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=25}}<ref name=\"NOTE\" /> He was the second son of entertainment couple [[Ozzie Nelson|Ozzie]] and [[Harriet Nelson]].

The film was a hit, and Ozzie was convinced the family could make the transition from radio's airwaves to television's small screen. On October 3, 1952, ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' made its television debut and was broadcast in first run until September 3, 1966, to become one of the longest running sitcoms in television history.\n\n==Education==\nNelson attended Gardner Street Public School,{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=23}} Bancroft Junior High,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=47}} and, between 1954 and 1958, [[Hollywood High School]], from which he graduated with a B average.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} He played [[American football|football]] at Hollywood High{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} and represented the school in interscholastic [[tennis]] matches.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=55}} Twenty-five years later, Nelson told the ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' he hated school because it \"smelled of pencils\" and he was forced to rise early in the morning to attend.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}} In January 1960 the athletic Nelson brothers formed a trapeze act with stunts in the 1/27/1960 episode of \"Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" titled 'THE CIRCUS'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/579275570816609584/|title=RICKY NELSON on the TRAPEZE!

Nelson's first album, ''Ricky'', was released in October 1957 and hit #1 before the end of the year.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=76}} Following these successes, Nelson was given a more prominent role on the ''Ozzie and Harriet'' show and ended every two or three episodes with a musical number.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=80}}\n\nNelson grew increasingly dissatisfied performing with older jazz and country session musicians, who were openly contemptuous of rock and roll. After his Ohio and Minnesota tours in the summer of 1957, he decided to form his own band with members closer to his age.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=81}} Eighteen-year-old electric guitarist [[James Burton]] was the first signed. Bassist James Kirkland, drummer Richie Frost, and pianist Gene Garf completed the band.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=83}} Their first recording together was \"[[Believe What You Say]]\". Prior to this, [[Joe Maphis]] had been playing the lead guitar part, and played lead on his first hits \"Be-Bop Baby\", \"Stood Up\", and \"Waitin In School\".\n\nIn 1958, Nelson recorded 17-year-old [[Sharon Sheeley]]'s \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\" for his second album, ''Ricky Nelson'', released in June 1958.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=89}} Radio airplay brought the tune notice, and Imperial suggested releasing a single, but Nelson opposed the idea, believing a single would diminish EP sales. When a single was released nonetheless, he exercised his contractual right to approve any artwork and vetoed a picture sleeve.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=89\u201390}} On August 4, 1958, \"Poor Little Fool\" became the #1 single on ''Billboard'''s newly instituted Hot 100 singles chart{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=91}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=90}} and sold over two million copies.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}\n\nNelson stated:\n{{blockquote|Anyone who knocks rock 'n' roll either doesn't understand it, or is prejudiced against it, or is just plain square. \u2013 ''[[NME]]'' \u2013 November 1958<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 3\" />}}\n\n[[File:Ricky Nelson - publicity.JPG|thumb|Nelson publicity photo, 1960]]\nDuring 1958 and 1959, Nelson had twelve hits in the charts in comparison with [[Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley's]] eleven.

In the summer of 1958, Nelson conducted his first full-scale tour, averaging $5,000 nightly.

Ozzie Nelson even had the idea to edit footage together to create some of the first music videos. This creative editing can be seen in videos Ozzie produced for \"Travelin' Man\". Nelson appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1967, but his career by that time was in limbo. He also appeared on other television shows (usually in acting roles). In 1973, he had an acting role in an episode of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} He starred in the episode \"A Hand For Sonny Blue\" from the 1977 series ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (known in the United Kingdom as ''Twist in the Tale'').

Nelson worked with many musicians of repute, including [[James Burton]], [[Joe Osborn]], and [[Allen \"Puddler\" Harris]], all natives of [[Louisiana]], and [[Joe Maphis]], [[The Jordanaires]], [[Scotty Moore]], and [[Johnny Burnette|Johnny]] and [[Dorsey Burnette]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nNelson's music was very well recorded with a clear, punchy sound\u2014thanks in part to engineer Bunny Robyn and producer Jimmy Haskell.<ref name=\"Tech\" />\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, Nelson had 30 Top-40 hits, more than any other artist except Presley (who had 53) and [[Pat Boone]] (38).

He made his film debut in ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]'' (1952) and had a small role in ''[[The Story of Three Loves]]'' (1953) at MGM directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]] playing [[Farley Granger]] as a boy.\n\nFollowing his success on TV and with singing, [[Howard Hawks]] cast him as a gunslinger in ''[[Rio Bravo (movie)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959) with [[John Wayne]] and [[Dean Martin]]; Hawks attributed much of the film's box office success to Nelson.\n\nNelson co-starred with [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[The Wackiest Ship in the Army (film)|The Wackiest Ship in the Army]]'' (1960), which was popular enough to give rise to a TV series (in which Nelson did not appear). He guest starred on ''[[General Electric Theatre]]'' (\"The Wish Book\") and starred in a romantic comedy feature written and directed by his father, ''[[Love and Kisses (1965 movie)|Love and Kisses]]'' (1965) with [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]].\n\nNelson guest starred on ''[[Hondo (TV series)|Hondo]]'' (playing [[Jesse James]]), and had a support role in ''[[The Over-the-Hill Gang]]'' (1969) with [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]].\n\nNelson was in ''[[Fol-de-Rol]]'' (1972), guest starred on ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law]]'', ''[[Petrocelli]]'', ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected|A Twist in the Tale]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', and ''[[The Love Boat]]''. On ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' he played the part of \"Tony Eagle\" and performed various well-known Nelson songs throughout the episode.\n\nHe had support roles in the TV films ''[[Three on a Date]]'' and ''[[High School USA]]'' (1983).\n\n==Name change and 1960s career==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2022}}\nOn May 8, 1961 (his 21st birthday), he officially modified his recording name from \"Ricky Nelson\" to \"Rick Nelson\". His childhood nickname proved hard to shake, especially among the generation who had watched him grow up on \"Ozzie and Harriet\". Even in the 1980s, when Nelson realized his dream of meeting [[Carl Perkins]], Perkins noted that he and \"Ricky\" were the last of the \"rockabilly breed\".\n\nIn 1963, Nelson signed a 20-year contract with [[Decca Records]]. After some early successes with the label, most notably 1964's \"For You\" (#6), Nelson's chart career came to a dramatic halt in the wake of [[Beatlemania]], [[The British Invasion]], and later the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture era]]. However, instead of dropping him, Decca kept him on board.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Nelson began to move toward [[country music]], becoming a pioneer in the country-rock genre. He was one of the early influences of the so-called \"[[California Sound]]\" (which would include singers like [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] and bands such as [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]). Yet Nelson himself did not reach the [[Top 40]] again until 1970, when he recorded [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"She Belongs to Me\" with the Stone Canyon Band, featuring [[Randy Meisner]], who in 1971 became a founding member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and former [[The Buckaroos|Buckaroo]] steel guitarist [[Tom Brumley]].\n\n==\"Garden Party\" and short-lived comeback==\n[[File:Rick Nelson performing 1970.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Nelson performing on ''The Jim Nabors Show'' in 1970]]\nIn 1972, Nelson reached the Top 40 one last time with \"[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]],\" a song he wrote in disgust after a [[Richard Nader]] [[Oldies]] Concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] where the audience booed, perhaps against some unrelated police action. However, Nelson may have felt that the reason was because he was playing new songs instead of just his old hits.<ref name=\"straightdope1\" /> When he performed [[The Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Honky Tonk Women]],\" there was booing, said to be against police and not him.<ref name=\"straightdope1\" /> He was watching the rest of the performance on a TV monitor backstage until Richard Nader finally convinced Nelson to return to the stage and play his \"oldies.\" He returned to the stage and played his \"oldies\" and the audience responded with applause, according to Deborah Nader, President of Richard Nader Entertainment. He wanted to record an album featuring original material, but the single was released before the album because Nelson had not completed the entire ''Garden Party'' album yet. \"Garden Party\" reached No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #1 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart]] and was certified as a [[RIAA certification|gold single]]. The second single released from the album was \"Palace Guard\" which peaked at #65.\n\nIn 1973, [[MCA Records]], whose parent company [[MCA Inc.]] had owned American Decca since 1962, ceased the label's operations, and transferred Nelson (and many other Decca artists) to its roster. His comeback was short-lived, and Nelson's band soon resigned. MCA wanted Nelson to have a producer on his next album. A new band was formed by [[Lindy Goetz]], then a promotion person at MCA Records.<ref name=\"GoodReads\" /> Nelson's band moved to Aspen and changed their name to \"Canyon.\" Nelson and the new Stone Canyon Band began to tour for the ''[[Garden Party (album)|Garden Party]]'' album. Nelson still played nightclubs and bars, but he soon advanced to higher-paying venues because of the success of ''Garden Party.''\n\nIn 1974, MCA was unsure as to what to do with the former teen idol. Albums like ''[[Windfall (Rick Nelson album)|Windfall]]'' failed to have an impact. Nelson became an attraction at theme parks like [[Knott's Berry Farm]] and [[Disneyland]]. He also started appearing in minor roles on television shows.\n\nNelson tried to score another hit but did not have any luck with songs like \"Rock and Roll Lady.\" With seven years to go on his contract, MCA dropped him from the label.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Rick kris nelson 1964.JPG|thumb|Ricky and Kristin Nelson in 1964]]\n\nIn 1957, when Nelson was 17, he met and fell in love with [[Marianne Gaba]], who played the role of Ricky's girlfriend in three episodes of ''Ozzie and Harriet''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=136}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=72}} Nelson and Gaba were too young to enter a serious relationship, although according to Gaba \"we used to [[Making out|neck]] ''for hours''.\"{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=137}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=73}}\n\nThe next year, Nelson fell in love with 15-year-old [[Lorrie Collins]], a country singer appearing on a weekly telecast called ''Town Hall Party''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=106}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=81}} The two wrote Nelson's first composition, the song \"My Gal\", and she introduced him to [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Tex Ritter]].

In October 1977, Kris filed for divorce and asked for alimony, custody of their four children, and a portion of community property. The couple temporarily resolved their differences, but Kris retained her attorney to pursue a permanent break.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=230}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=205}} Kris wanted Rick to give up music, spend more time at home, and focus on acting, but the family enjoyed a recklessly expensive lifestyle, and Kris's extravagant spending left Rick no choice but to tour relentlessly.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=251}} The impasse over Rick's career created unpleasantness at home.

Although he recorded three more songs with Mercury, his contract was soon terminated.<ref name=mcdowell />\n\n===Rock and roll career===\nIn 1958, Twitty's fortunes improved when an Ohio radio station had an inspiration, refraining from playing \"I'll Try\" (an MGM single that went nowhere in terms of sales, radio play, and [[jukebox]] play), instead playing the B-side, \"[[It's Only Make Believe]]\", a song written between sets by Twitty and drummer Jack Nance when they were in Hamilton, Ontario, playing at the Flamingo Lounge.<ref name=\"MEMPROJ44\">{{Cite press release |title=The Hamilton Memory Project |date=June 10, 2006 |publisher=Hamilton Spectator Newspaper, Souvenir Edition |page=MP44}}</ref> The record took several months to reach and stay at the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1958|top spot]] on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop music charts in the United States and number 1 in 21 other countries, becoming the first of nine top-40 hits for Twitty.

Twitty would go on to enjoy rock-and-roll success with songs including \"[[Danny Boy]]\" (Pop number 10) and \"[[Lonely Blue Boy (song)|Lonely Blue Boy]]\" (Pop number 6). \"Lonely Blue Boy\", originally titled \"Danny\", was recorded by Presley for the film ''[[King Creole]]'' but was not used in the soundtrack. This song led to him naming his band the Lonely Blue Boys. They subsequently became the Twitty Birds.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> As his recording career continued, Twitty's music shifted from rockabilly to [[rock and roll]], and Twitty also recorded some [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[blues]] singles.<ref name=Koda/>\n\nBy 1965, Twitty had become disillusioned with rock & roll, particularly with the behavior of the fans,<ref name=ellison /> and walked out of a show in the middle of a performance in New Jersey.<ref name=bronson/> He sued his manager to be released from his contract, and moved to perform country music in [[Oklahoma City]].<ref name=ellison>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P1qyHCmpT7EC&pg=PA248 |title=Country Music Culture: From Hard Times to Heaven|first= Curtis W. |last=Ellison |date= 1995|isbn=9781604739343 |publisher=University Press of Mississippi|page=248}}</ref>\n\n===Country music career===\nTwitty always wanted to record country music, and, beginning in 1965, he did just that. Disc jockeys on some country-music radio stations refused to play his first few country albums, because he was known as a rock and roll singer. However, he had his first top-five country hit, \"The Image of Me\", in July 1968, followed by his first number one country song, \"[[Next in Line (Conway Twitty song)|Next in Line]]\", in November 1968. Few of his singles beginning in 1968 ranked below the top five.\n\nIn 1970, Twitty recorded and released his biggest country hit, \"[[Hello Darlin' (song)|Hello Darlin']]\", which spent four weeks at the top of the country chart and is one of Twitty's most recognized songs. In 1971, he released his first hit duet with [[Loretta Lynn]], \"[[After the Fire Is Gone]]\". It was a success, and many more followed, including \"[[Lead Me On (Conway Twitty and Loretta Lynn song)|Lead Me On]]\" (1971), \"[[Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man (song)|Louisiana Woman, Mississippi Man]]\" (1973), \"[[As Soon As I Hang Up the Phone]]\" (1974), \"[[Feelins']]\" (1975), \"I Still Believe in Waltzes\", \"[[I Can't Love You Enough]]\", and many others. Together, Conway and Loretta (as they were known in their act) won four consecutive [[Country Music Association]] awards for vocal duo (1972\u20131975) and a host of other duo and duet awards from other organizations throughout the 1970s.\n\nIn 1973, Twitty released \"[[You've Never Been This Far Before]]\", which was number 1 in country for three weeks that September and also reached number 22 on the pop charts. Some more conservative disc jockeys refused to play the song, believing that some of the lyrics were too sexually suggestive.\n\nIn 1978, Twitty issued the single \"The Grandest Lady of Them All\" honoring the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]''. (Somewhat ironically, Twitty was never inducted into the ''Opry'' during his lifetime; he remains one of the more prominent [[Nashville]] country artists never to have been an Opry member.) The single reached the top 20, peaking at number 16, but it was well below expectations; it was the first time since 1967 that a single of his failed to reach the top ten, as some radio stations refused to play a song honoring the property of a competitor (broadcast by [[WSM-AM]]).\n\nTwitty soon renewed his image with a new hairstyle, changing from the slicked-back [[pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]] style to the curlier style he would keep for the rest of his life; by the late 1970s, Twitty had shifted his musical arrangements into a [[country pop]] style he would maintain for the rest of his career.<ref name=Kamau>{{cite web |url=https://www.classicrockhistory.com/top-10-conway-twitty-songs/ |title=Top 10 Conway Twitty Songs |last=Kamau |first=Eric |date=January 2022 |publisher=Classic Rock History |access-date=2022-11-18}}</ref> His next 23 consecutive singles all made it into the top 10, with 13 reaching number one, including \"[[Don't Take It Away]]\", \"[[I May Never Get to Heaven]]\", \"[[Happy Birthday Darlin']]\", and remakes of major pop hits such as \"[[The Rose (song)|The Rose]]\", \"[[Slow Hand]]\" and \"Tight Fittin' Jeans\", a song written by Michael Huffman, released in June 1981 as the first single from the album ''Mr. T''. The song was Twitty's 26th number one on the country chart. The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of 10 weeks on the country chart. In 1985, going by all weekly music trade charts, the song \"[[Don't Call Him a Cowboy]]\" became the 50th single of his career to achieve a number-one ranking. He would have five more through 1990, giving him a total of 55 number-one hits. [[George Strait]] matched the feat of 50 number-one hits in 2002 with his single \"[[She'll Leave You with a Smile]]\" and then reached number 1 for the 56th time in 2007, when the single \"[[Wrapped (Bruce Robison song)|Wrapped]]\" hit the top on the Media Base 24/7 list.\n\nThroughout much of Twitty's country music career his recording home was Decca Records, later renamed [[MCA Records|MCA]]. He signed with the label in late 1965 but left in 1981, when it appeared MCA was marketing and promoting newer acts; management at the label had changed, in addition to other factors that brought on the decision. He joined Elektra/Asylum in 1982. That label's country music unit merged with sister label [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1983. He stayed with Warner Bros. through early 1987 but then went back to MCA to finish his career. In 1993, shortly before he died, he recorded a new album, ''[[Final Touches]]''.\n\n===Films===\nTwitty had a short career in films, appearing in a few [[B-movies]] in 1960 in which he acted and sang, starting with ''[[Platinum High School]]'', followed by ''[[College Confidential (film)|College Confidential]]'' and ''[[Sex Kittens Go to College]]''.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZjrAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA409 |title=Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary|first= Richard |last=Carlin |date= 2014|isbn=9781135361044 |publisher=Taylor & Francis|page=409}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RT4UAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA204 |title=All Roots Lead to Rock: Legends of Early Rock 'n' Roll : a Bear Family Reader |author= Bear Family Records |date= 1999 |publisher=Schirmer Books|page=204|isbn=9780028648668 }}</ref>\n\n===Baseball===\n[[File:Conway Twitty Nashville Sounds first pitch April 26, 1978.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Twitty throwing out the first pitch at the first [[Nashville Sounds]] game on April 26, 1978]]\nTwitty also played baseball, his second passion.

His first marriage, to Ellen Matthews, lasted from 1953 to 1954. They had married because Ellen was pregnant with their son, Michael. His second, and longest, marriage was to Temple \"Mickey\" Medley. They were married in 1956 and had three children: Kathy, Joni Lee, and Jimmy Twitty. The couple were divorced in early 1970, but they remarried quietly by the end of 1970. By 1984, after 28 years of marriage on and off, the stress of Twitty's frequent absences took its toll on Mickey, and she and Conway divorced. Mickey Twitty died in 2021. In 1987, Twitty married his 36-year-old office secretary, Delores \"Dee\" Henry, who became his widow in June 1993.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hevesi |first=Dennis |date=June 6, 1993 |title=Conway Twitty, 59, Dies on Tour; Country Star Had 50 No. 1 Songs |language=en-US |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/obituaries/conway-twitty-59-dies-on-tour-country-star-had-50-no-1-songs.html |access-date=2021-11-09 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nTwitty made [[Oklahoma City]] his home during most of his recording career, from 1963 to 1972.

[[John Hughey]], who was Twitty's steel guitar player, found him on the ground. Many people, including family members, said that Twitty underwent a change in personality after the accident.\n\nTwitty served on the board of directors of [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] (Country Music Television) from 1984 to 1988, after Music Village Group (Nyhl Henson, Gilbert Biggers, Hall Hardaway Jr. and Benny and Dean Jaggers) acquired CMTV from Glen Daniels. (Inheriting a copyright infringement suit from Viacom, owner of MTV, settled for an undisclosed sum.) The Music Village Group, built Music Village USA adjacent to Twitty City including a state-of-the-art 1,776-seat theatre where CMT uplinked its 24-hour programming and produced live concerts. When Music Village and Twitty was sold in 1989 and CMT in 1990, Conway turned his attention to the burgeoning [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] market playing to sell-out crowds.

Conway's most recent appearance on the country charts was a duet with [[Anita Cochran]], \"(I Want to Hear) A Cheating Song\" (2004), which was made possible by splicing Twitty's vocal from old recordings and interviews, recorded over the years. As a result, Twitty's isolated vocal track was transferred to a digital multitrack and digitally reassembled into the new performance. Like the electronic duets of [[Patsy Cline]] and [[Jim Reeves]], [[Hank Williams]] and [[Hank Williams Jr.]], or [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Natalie Cole]], Cochran added her vocal to backing tracks that had already been produced along with Twitty's reconstructed vocals.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\nCurrently, Bear Family Records offers the single-disc collection ''Conway Rocks'', featuring 30 songs, and ''The Rock 'n' Roll Years'', a comprehensive eight-disc box set showcasing his complete early recordings as a rock artist.<ref>[https://www.bear-family.com/twitty-conway/ Who was/is Twitty, Conway?] Bear Family Records.</ref>\n\n==Legal issues==\n===Taxes===\nTwitty's success in country music was a key factor in his winning the 1983 case ''Harold L. Jenkins (a/k/a Conway Twitty) v. Commissioner'' in United States Tax Court. The Internal Revenue Service allowed Twitty to deduct from his taxes, as an \"ordinary and necessary\" business expense, payments that he had made to repay investors in a defunct fast-food chain called Twitty Burger; the chain disestablished in 1971.

His widow in 1993, Delores \"Dee\" Henry Jenkins, and his four grown children from the previous marriages, Michael, [[Joni Lee|Joni]], Kathy and Jimmy Jenkins, engaged in a public dispute over the estate. Twitty's will had not been updated to account for the fourth marriage, but Tennessee law reserves one third of any estate to the widow. After years of probate, the four children received the rights to Twitty's music, name and image. The rest of the estate went to public auction, where much of the property and memorabilia was sold after his widow rejected the appraised value.\n\nIn 2008, controversy again erupted in his family when the four remaining children sued [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]] over an agreement that Twitty and his family signed in 1990. The suit alleged that the terms of the agreement were not fully understood by the children, although they were all adults at the time. It sought to recover copyrights and royalty revenue that the document assigned to the company.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 1, 2008 |title=Twitty's children sue Sony for royalties |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/conway-twitty/news/twittys-children-sue-sony-for-royalties--57964316 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712082622/http://new.music.yahoo.com/conway-twitty/news/twittys-children-sue-sony-for-royalties--57964316 |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

He was raised by his maternal grandparents in [[Louise, Mississippi]], where they had a small farm and [[dry goods]] store.\n\nSmith took up the guitar to while away his evenings while in the [[United States Air Force]] stationed in San Antonio, Texas. By the time of his discharge from the service, he had decided to make a career of music. He moved to [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], and auditioned, successfully, to play the Cotton Club, a local nightclub. The steel guitarist [[Stan Kesler]], who was playing there with the Snearly Ranch Boys, immediately spotted Smith's potential and took him to [[Sun Records]] to audition for [[Sam Phillips]], with the Snearly Ranch Boys providing backup.\n\nPhillips liked what he heard and decided that \"Rock 'n' Roll Ruby\", a song credited to [[Johnny Cash]], would be Smith's first record. (Smith later claimed that the song was actually written by [[George Jones]] and sold to Cash for $40.){{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Smith recorded it on February 5, 1956. Phillips, playing it safe in case rock and roll did not maintain its popularity, released it with a country crooner, aptly named \"I'd Rather Be Safe Than Sorry\", on the flip side. By May 26, \"Rock 'n' Roll Ruby\" had reached number 1 on the local pop chart; this record, his first for Sun, went on to outsell the first Sun releases by [[Elvis Presley]], Johnny Cash and [[Carl Perkins]].\n\nIn August 1956, Smith went back to the Sun Records studio to record his second release, \"[[Ubangi Stomp]]\", an infectious rocker with crude lyrics and vocals suggesting an African chief with the [[syntax]] of a movie Indian. For the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], he recorded the classic ballad \"[[The Gypsy Laddie|Black Jack David]]\", a song that originated in early 18th-century Britain and survived in various forms in the mountains of the American South; it may be the oldest song ever recorded by a rock-and-roll performer. Although a resounding artistic success, this record did not sell as well as Smith's debut.\n\nIn 1957, Smith recorded \"So Long, I'm Gone\", a song written by [[Roy Orbison]]. It became his biggest hit for Sun, peaking at number 74 on the ''Billboard'' national chart. But Sun had no cash to promote it, as Sam Phillips put every dollar Sun had behind [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]'s \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On]]\". Smith continued to make rockabilly records for Sun, including a [[cover version]] of [[Slim Harpo]]'s \"Got Love If You Want It\" (recorded in October 1957), but these records did not do well commercially. Toward the end of 1958, seeing his future in [[country music]], he cut a final record for Sun, a cover version of [[Don Gibson]]'s \"Sweet Sweet Girl\". In spite of a review in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' calling it \"ultra commercial\", this record also did not sell well. Like other artists such as [[Sonny Burgess]], [[Hayden Thompson]], [[Billy Lee Riley]] and [[Ray Harris]], Smith had little success on the charts.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite book\n| first= Paul\n| last= Du Noyer\n| year= 2003\n| title= The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Music\n| edition= \n| publisher= Flame Tree Publishing \n| location= Fulham, London\n| isbn= 1-904041-96-5\n| page= 19}}</ref> He then decided to leave Sun Records.\n\nIn 1959, Smith and his wife and son moved from Mississippi to California, settling in Sherman Oaks, not far from Johnny and Vivian Cash. Cash offered Smith a spot on his show, but Smith turned it down, seeing himself as a headliner, not a supporting player. In early 1960, Smith signed a contract with [[Liberty Records]] and immediately had a hit with \"I Don't Believe I'll Fall in Love Today\", which went to number 5 on the ''Billboard'' country and Western chart. This record and subsequent Liberty releases were produced by [[Joe Allison]] and featured one of California's best country session musicians, [[Ralph Mooney]], on [[pedal steel guitar]]. Smith scored again with his next record for Liberty, \"Odds and Ends, Bits and Pieces\", written by [[Harlan Howard]]. He recorded several more tracks for Liberty, mostly cover versions of recent country hits, to fill out an album, ''The First Country Collection of Warren Smith''. He continued to record for Liberty, with some success, and toured with his band, from 1960 to 1965.\n\nOn August 17, 1965, Smith suffered severe back injuries in a car crash in [[LaGrange, Texas]]. It took nearly a year for him to recover. By this time, his contract with Liberty had lapsed. He made several attempts to restart his career, first with a small, virtually amateur label called Skill Records, and then with [[Mercury Records]], but addictions to pills and alcohol held him back. Eventually, he was convicted of robbing a pharmacy and sentenced to an 18-month term in an Alabama prison.\n\nAfter his release from prison, Smith again tried to restart his career. He got some publicity from the rockabilly revival in the late 1970s. In 1977 he was invited to appear at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], on a bill featuring [[Charlie Feathers]], [[Buddy Knox]] and [[Jack Scott (singer)|Jack Scott]]. To his shock, Smith was received in London with standing ovations. His reception in England boosted his spirits and, upon his return to the United States, he began to perform with newfound vigor. In November 1978, Smith and fellow Sun alumnus [[Ray Smith (rockabilly singer)|Ray Smith]] toured Europe, again with great success.\n\nSmith died of a heart attack, at 47 years of age, in 1980, while preparing for another European tour.\n\n==Legacy==\nSmith's contribution to rockabilly music has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. [[Bob Dylan]] repeatedly featured Smith on his [[XM Satellite Radio]] show, ''[[Theme Time Radio Hour]]'', playing Smith's records \"Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache\", \"Uranium Rock\", \"Ubangi Stomp\" and \"So Long, I'm Gone\". Dylan recorded a studio version of \"Red Cadillac and a Black Moustache\" in 2001; he also played that song and another recorded by Smith, \"Uranium Rock\", in concert in 1986. \nIn 2015, \"Uranium Rock\" was also featured in the video game ''[[Fallout 4]]''. \"Uranium Rock\" was also covered by [[The Cramps]] on their second compilation album \"Bad Music For Bad People\".\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Thompson then joined the Dixie Jazzlanders who toured Mississippi.  He relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and made an unreleased recording in 1956.  \"Love My Baby\" was issued on the Phillips International label in September 1957, and Thompson toured alongside [[Sonny Burgess]] and [[Billy Lee Riley]].  The following year, Thompson moved again, this time to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he gained a residency at the Rivoli Ballroom, Chicago's latest country music venue.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\nThompson's recording of \"$16.88\" for [[Kapp Records]] sold sufficiently to secure him an offer to record his debut album.  ''Here's Hayden Thompson'' was released in 1967.  Several recordings took place in the early-1970s, but circumstances meant that Thompson left the music industry at this point and worked as a limo driver.  He re-emerged in the mid-1980s, becoming a regular performer on rockabilly revival touring packages.  Charley Records released an album of his in 1985.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>  Further albums were released, mainly by various European record labels, over the three decades.

He was strongly influenced by his parents, who were members of the Landmark Missionary Baptist Church; his mother, Helen Rich, played piano in church and his father sang in gospel quartets. A black sharecropper on the family land named C. J. Allen taught Rich blues piano. He enrolled at [[Arkansas State College]] on a football scholarship and then after an injury, transferred to the [[University of Arkansas]] as a music major. He left after one semester to join the [[United States Air Force]] in 1953.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nHe married Margaret Ann Greene in 1952. While stationed in [[Enid, Oklahoma|Enid]], Oklahoma, he formed \"the Velvetones\", playing jazz and blues and featuring his wife on vocals.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> When he left the military in 1956, the couple returned to the West Memphis area to farm 500 acres. He also began performing in clubs around the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] area, playing both jazz and [[R&B]], and began writing his own material.\n\n==Career==\nAfter recording some demonstration songs for [[Sam Phillips]] at [[Sun Records]] that Phillips considered \"too jazzy\" and insufficiently commercial, Rich was given a stack of [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] records and told: \"Come back when you get that bad.\"<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> In a 1992 interview with ''[[Fresh Air]]'' host [[Terry Gross]], Rich himself recalled [[Bill Justis]] telling Rich's wife those words.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=129612715 |title=Charlie Rich: The Silver Fox With A Big Country Sound |publisher=Npr.org |date=September 6, 2010 |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Rich became a regular [[session musician]] for Sun Records, playing on a variety of records by Lewis, [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bill Justis]], [[Warren Smith (singer)|Warren Smith]], [[Billy Lee Riley]], [[Carl Mann]], and [[Ray Smith (rockabilly singer)|Ray Smith]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He also wrote several songs for Lewis, Cash, and others.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nAfter he began recording for the Sun subsidiary [[Phillips International Records]], his third single was the 1960 Top 30 hit \"Lonely Weekends\",<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> with [[Elvis Presley|Presley]]-like vocals.

In 1965 he moved to [[Smash Records]], where his new producer, [[Jerry Kennedy]], encouraged him to emphasize his country and rock n' roll leanings, although Rich considered himself a jazz pianist and had not paid much attention to country music since childhood.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> His first single for Smash was \"Mohair Sam\", an R&B-inflected [[Novelty song|novelty]]-rock number written by [[Dallas Frazier]], which became a top 30 pop hit. It has been mentioned in thousands of articles as the song Elvis Presley   played on his jukebox during the Beatles' visit to his home on August 26, 1965. However, once more none of his follow-up singles were successful. Rich again changed labels, moving to [[Hi Records]], where he recorded [[blue-eyed soul]] music and straight country, but once more, none of his singles for Hi made a dent on the country or pop charts. One Hi Records track, \"Love Is After Me\" (1966), belatedly became a [[white soul]] favorite in the early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\n===Career peak in the 1970s===\nDespite his lack of consistent commercial success, [[Epic Records]] signed Rich in 1967, mainly on the recommendation of producer [[Billy Sherrill]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Sherrill helped Rich refashion himself as a [[Nashville Sound]] balladeer during an era when old rock 'n' roll artists like Jerry Lee Lewis and [[Conway Twitty]] were finding a new musical home in the Country format. This new \"[[countrypolitan]]\" Rich sound paid off in the summer of 1972, when \"I Take It on Home\" went to number six on the country charts.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The title track from his 1973 album ''Behind Closed Doors'' became a number-one country hit early in that year, then crossed over into the top 20 on the pop charts.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> This time, his follow-up single did not disappoint, as \"[[The Most Beautiful Girl]]\" spent three weeks at the top of the country charts and two weeks at the top of the pop charts.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Now that he was established as a country music star, ''Behind Closed Doors'' won three awards from the [[Country Music Association]] that year: Best Male Vocalist, Album of the Year, and Single of the Year. The album was also certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]]. Rich won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, and he took home four [[Academy of Country Music]] awards. One of [[RCA Victor]]'s several resident songwriters, Marvin Walters, co-wrote for three years with Rich, producing four recordings including the popular \"Set Me Free\".{{citation needed|date=May 2022}}\n\nAfter \"The Most Beautiful Girl,\" number-one hits came quickly, five songs topping the country charts in 1974 and crossed over to the pop charts:<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> \"There Won't Be Anymore\" (pop number 18), \"[[A Very Special Love Song]]\" (pop number 11), \"I Don't See Me In Your Eyes Anymore\" (pop number 47), \"I Love My Friend\" (pop number 24), and \"She Called Me Baby\" (pop number 47). Both RCA Records and [[Mercury Records]] (Smash was a subsidiary of Mercury that was absorbed into the main company in 1970) also re-released his previously recorded material from the mid-1960s. All of this success led the CMA to name him Entertainer of the Year in 1974.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Singer Charlie Rich protests John Denver\u2019s big win at the CMA Awards |url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/singer-charlie-rich-protests-john-denvers-big-win-at-the-cma-awards |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=HISTORY |language=en}}</ref> In the same year he performed the Academy Award-nominated theme song \"I Feel Love (Benji's Theme)\" from the film ''[[Benji (1974 film)|Benji]]''. Rich had three more top-five hits in 1975, but though he was at the peak of his popularity, he began to drink heavily, causing considerable problems off-stage.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oliver |first=Myrna |date=1995-07-26 |title=Charlie Rich; Eclectic Country Singer |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1995-07-26-mn-27997-story.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Charlie Rich |url=https://elpee.jp/artist/Charlie%20Rich/ |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=elpee.jp |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==== CMA awards 1975 ====\nRich's problematic drinking famously culminated at the CMA awards ceremony for 1975,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> when he presented the award for Entertainer of the Year while visibly intoxicated.<ref name=\"charlierichjr.com\" /> After stumbling through the names of the nominees, he clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit fire to the paper with the winner's name.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> He then announced the winner of the award as \"My friend Mr. [[John Denver]]\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Prachi Gupta |url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/13/today_in_70s_nostalgia_watch_a_charlie_rich_burn_john_denver_at_the_1975_cmas/ |title=Today in '70s nostalgia: Watch Charlie Rich burn John Denver at the 1975 CMAs |work=Salon.com |date=June 13, 2014 |access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> Some considered it an act of rebellion against the [[Music Row]]-controlled Nashville Sound; others speculated that it was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too \"pop\" and not enough \"country\".<ref name=\"charlierichjr.com\" /> Many, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich's popularity took a dive.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  <!-- Removed this as conflicting with following sections; perhaps this was his only subsequent top 10 *pop* single?: recording just one more top ten single with \"Since I Fell for You\" -->\n\nIn a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director [[Jo Walker-Meador]] speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website:<blockquote>I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis.&nbsp;... So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed.&nbsp;... Primarily he thought it would be funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver.<ref name=\"charlierichjr.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.charlierichjr.com/controversy/the_envelope_burning/ |title=The Envelope Burning |publisher=Charlie Rich Jr. |access-date=October 12, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe slump in Rich's career was exacerbated by the fact that his records began to sound increasingly similar: pop-inflected country ballads with [[overdub]]bed [[string instruments|strings]] and little jazz or blues. He did not have a top-10 hit again until \"[[Rollin' With the Flow]]\" went to number one on the country charts (as well as number 32 on the easy listening charts) in 1977.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Early the following year, in 1978, he signed with [[United Artists Records]], and throughout that year, he had hits on both Epic and UA. His hits in 1978 included the top-10 hits \"Beautiful Woman\", \"Puttin' In Overtime At Home\", and his last number one with \"[[On My Knees (1978 song)|On My Knees]]\", a duet with [[Janie Fricke]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\n===Decline in activity and semi-retirement===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2022}}\nIn 1979, Rich had moderate success with his singles, his biggest hit being a version of \"[[Spanish Eyes (1965 song)|Spanish Eyes]]\" that entered the country top 20.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Greatest Country Hits of 1979 |url=http://www.severing.nu/music/c1979.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=www.severing.nu}}</ref> He appeared as himself in the 1978 [[Clint Eastwood]] movie ''[[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|Every Which Way but Loose]]'', performing \"I'll Wake You Up When I Get Home\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> This song hit number three on the country charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 country single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to [[Elektra Records]] and that fall released a number-12 country single, \"A Man Just Don't Know What a Woman Goes Through\". One more top-40 hit followed, the [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]] song \"Are We Dreamin' the Same Dream\" early in 1981. Also in 1981, he had a bit part in the movie ''[[Take This Job and Shove It (film)|Take This Job and Shove It]]'', which yielded his last charted single, \"You Made It Beautiful\". Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight, and for over a decade he lived off his investments in semi-retirement, only playing occasional concerts. \n\nIn 1992, Rich emerged from his semi-retirement to release on [[Sire Records]] ''Pictures and Paintings'', a jazzy album produced by journalist [[Peter Guralnick]].<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It received positive critical reviews and restored Rich's reputation as a musician, but it was his last album. In 2016, a tribute album entitled ''Feel Like Going Home: The Songs of Charlie Rich'' was released by Memphis International Records.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-10-13 |title=Review: Charlie Rich tribute explores legend's Sun years |url=https://apnews.com/charlie-rich-tribute-music-abb293147541410494c0543a81c3ba08 |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=AP News |language=en}}</ref>  [[Tom Waits]], who was an opening act for Rich in the 1970s, mentions him in the song \"Putnam County\" from his album ''[[Nighthawks at the Diner]]'' with the lyric: \"The radio's spitting out Charlie Rich...
