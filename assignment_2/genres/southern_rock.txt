Prior to auditioning for ''American Idol'', Bice released a solo album as well as a few albums with his bands while performing on the night club circuit.\n\nBice charted in 2005 at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with a rendition of \"[[Inside Your Heaven]]\" from ''American Idol''. He released the album ''[[The Real Thing (Bo Bice album)|The Real Thing]]'' after ''American Idol'' to minor success before being dropped by RCA Records. He started his own record label Sugar Money and subsequently released two more albums, ''[[See the Light (Bo Bice album)|See the Light]]'' and ''[[3 (Bo Bice album)|3]].'' He was also the lead singer of [[Blood, Sweat & Tears]] from 2013 until 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodsweatandtears.com/ |title=Blood Sweat & Tears official web site |access-date=2014-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006092029/http://www.bloodsweatandtears.com/ |archive-date=2014-10-06 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Childhood ==\nBice was born in [[Huntsville, Alabama]] to Nancy and Harold Elwin Bice. His mother was a gospel singer as were his grandmother, great-grandmother, and aunts. Bice was [[nickname]]d \"Bogart\" as a newborn by his grandmother, \"Granny Madge\", because she thought he had \"[[Humphrey Bogart]] eyes\". His family continued to call him Bogart, but when Bice was in kindergarten he shortened it to \"Bo\" because he did not think Bogart was cool. Bice's parents divorced when he was very young, and his mother remarried years later. Bice grew up with his mother and step-father, Earle Downes, a Coca-Cola manager, step-sisters Jenny and Sharan Downes, and half-brother John Cohran. Bice has two other half-siblings, Candace and Matthew, on his biological father's side. The Downes family moved around the [[Southern United States|South]] frequently. They lived in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Alabama]], and [[Florida]], including the metro area of [[Atlanta]]. In 1990 when Bice was 14 years old they moved to England, as part of his step-father's European assignment with [[Coca-Cola]] in London.\n\nBice spent his teenage years living in [[Gerrards Cross]]. Bice attended [[London Central High School]], a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] school primarily for children whose parents served in the military or worked at the U.S. Embassy. In high school, he carried his [[guitar]] everywhere and played [[American football|football]]. It was around this time when Bice worked with some English [[alternative rock]] musicians.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} He formed his first band, Spinning Jenny, while living there. Bice would have graduated in 1994, but in the fall of 1993, Bice dropped out of high school just before turning 18 to move back to Alabama, where he earned his [[GED]] and attended classes at [[Calhoun Community College]] from November 1996 to May 1997.\n\n== Career==\n===Career beginnings and ''American Idol'': 1997\u20132005===\nUpon leaving Calhoun and spending one semester at the [[University of North Alabama]] in [[Florence, Alabama|Florence]], Bice turned professional and performed in shows all across the United States, the United Kingdom, [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and Europe. He was a veteran of the [[nightclub]] circuit, releasing his first CD in 1995 with his band Purge.<ref>{{cite web |last=Ortega |first=Shawna |url=http://www.songfacts.com/int/2008/08/bo-bice.html |title=Bo Bice: Songwriter Interviews |publisher=Songfacts |date=2008-07-23 |access-date=October 5, 2008 |archive-date=October 18, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018125127/http://www.songfacts.com/int/2008/08/bo-bice.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> His other pre-''Idol'' bands include Blue Suede Nickel and [[Sugar Money (band)|SugarMoney]].

Bice had recorded other albums prior to his stint on ''American Idol'', which included ''Ex Gratia'' (1999) with his band Purge, and ''Recipe for Flavor'' (2000) with SugarMoney. In 2001, Bice was charged with purchasing [[cocaine]] at a [[strip club]].

He performed two concerts the following week, including a benefit concert for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, but was back in the hospital the next day with surgery complications. In November Bice was named \"Heartland Hero of the Week\" on [[John Kasich]]'s show, ''[[Heartland with John Kasich|Heartland]]'', for giving up his house to the family displaced by Hurricane Katrina and for using his music to raise money for victims of Hurricane Katrina. [[Jim Croce]]'s family awarded Bice the \"Jim Croce 20th Annual Music Award\" because the Croce family had been greatly moved by Bice's performance of Croce's song \"Time in a Bottle\" while he was a contestant on ''American Idol''.\n\n===''The Real Thing'' and recurring medical problems: 2005\u20132006===\nBice's solo debut album, ''[[The Real Thing (Bo Bice album)|The Real Thing]]'', was released on December 13, 2005.

Bice's band at the time appears with him on three tracks on ''The Real Thing'''s DualDisc version. In January 2006, [[Country Music Television|CMT]] aired an hour-long TV special\u2014called ''Bo Bice: In the Moment''\u2014which chronicled Bice's life post-Idol during the recording of his album, ''The Real Thing''. Their cameras had followed Bice around for months during the making of his album. The film showed both his joy with making an album and his frustration with recording other people's pop songs. The cameras also captured the birth of his son, Aidan. On December 18, Bice started [[coughing up blood]] while rehearsing for a performance on the 2005 [[Radio Music Awards]], and had to miss the show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2005/12/19/bo_bice_out_of_radio_music_awards/7382/ |title=Top News, Latest headlines, Latest News, World News & U.S News |work=United Press International |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124151135/http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/Entertainment/2005/12/19/bo_bice_out_of_radio_music_awards/7382/ |archive-date=2009-01-24}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2006, Bice kicked off a radio promo tour. During the ensuing year of promotional appearances and touring, Bice continued to suffer with the recurring intestinal condition which had not been repaired by the August 2005 surgery. In the span of just a few months during his various tours, Bice was hospitalized 20 times, checking out of the hospitals each time to honor his performance commitments. In March 2006, Bice sang on the ''American Idol'' Top 16 Results Show. In April 2006, Bice was one of the celebrity drivers featured in the [[Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race]] held in [[Long Beach, California]], that was sponsored by [[Toyota]] to benefit various children's hospitals of Southern California. On September 12, 2006, Bice released a cover of [[The Chambers Brothers]] 1968 smash hit, \"[[Time Has Come Today]]\", which was the theme song for a new [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]] commercial. In September 2006, Bice was a special guest star in a TV special called ''Decades Rock Live: Lynyrd Skynyrd & Friends''\u2014the friends being Bice, [[Hank Williams Jr.]], and [[3 Doors Down]].\n\nOn October 5, 2006, Bice underwent emergency surgery in [[Nashville, Tennessee]] to correct his recurring intestinal problem. The surgery came after several rounds of tests and doctors deemed his condition serious enough to operate immediately. The day after that surgery, a complication occurred and Bice had to undergo another surgery. During the subsequent recovery time, [[Ben Stiller]] invited Bice to record for the [[Will Ferrell]] film ''[[Blades of Glory]]'' produced by Stiller. Bice made several promotional appearances in connection with the releases. Bice was presented with a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] for ''The Real Thing'' not long after [[RCA]] dropped Bice from its roster.\n\n=== Sugar Money Records, ''See The Light'' and ''3'': 2007\u20132013 ===\nIn the spring and summer of 2006, Bice began to talk of his hopes for a second CD, saying that \"[he]'d like to go more rootsy, more country, more southern rock Bo.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.semissourian.com/story/1167395.html |title=seMissourian.com: Entertainment: Banking on Bo (09/08/06) |work=seMissourian.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017223120/http://www.semissourian.com/story/1167395.html |archive-date=2006-10-17}}</ref> Bice encouraged his fans to start a petition asking [[Clive Davis]] for Bo's original southern rock songs on a subsequent CD. The Grassroots Coalition to Hear More Bo started the online Petition to Hear More Bo, which collected over 5,300 signatures before it was closed February 21, 2007, after word broke that Bice was no longer with RCA. Bice subsequently formed his own record label called Sugar Money/StratArt (in partnership with [[Strategic Artist Management]]). He spent the next few months planning, writing, and recording music for his new album, ''[[See the Light (Bo Bice album)|See the Light]]''. Bice introduced many of his newly written songs on a short acoustic tour which began in May 2007 and ended a few weeks later with his hospitalization for flu and bronchitis. ''[[See the Light (Bo Bice album)|See the Light]]'' was released October 23, 2007.\n\n[[File:Bo Bice Share the Beat Atlanta 2008.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bice in September 2008]]\nIn October 2007, Bice made an appearance on the TV show ''[[American Chopper|American Chopper: The Series]]'' in an episode which featured a custom-built Peavey Bike with a built-in guitar, microphone, and amp. [[Peavey Electronics|Peavey Electronics Corporation]] and Bice were working together to develop a Bo Bice guitar for their line of products. Bice had made appearances in Peavey Electronics Corporation's after school programs (in conjunction with National Afterschool Alliance) during which Peavey donated instruments to schools. In February 2008, Bice traveled to [[Kuwait]] and [[Afghanistan]] to perform for U.S. troops deployed in the region, and to thank them for their service. He went back to the war region in Fall 2008. During Spring and Summer 2008, Bice continued his tour promoting his ''See the Light'' album. He simultaneously spent a few weeks participating in a special tour called ''It Was Forty Years Ago Today'' with [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Denny Laine]], [[Lou Gramm]], and [[Christopher Cross]]. The tour paid tribute to the fortieth anniversary of the release of the [[Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band|Sgt. Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.\n\nOn September 13, Bice participated in \"Share the Beat\", a benefit for the Georgia Transplant Foundation and the James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness. Bice sang two tracks on the ''Brothers of the Southland'' CD,<ref>[http://www.southernfriedmagazine.com/magazine/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=185&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 Southern Fried Magazine'' August 1, 2007]</ref> a compilation spearheaded by [[The Marshall Tucker Band]]'s [[George McCorkle]] who had died from cancer just days prior to the recording sessions. On December 2, Bice was invited to Washington to perform for President Bush. Throughout 2009, Bice continued touring to support ''See the Light''. Bice did tour dates with Lynyrd Skynyrd. Bice was honored with the prestigious Lifetime Presidential Volunteer Service Award for volunteering more than 4,000 hours of his time for worthy causes, such as [[Habitat for Humanity]], Katrina assistance, [[muscular dystrophy]], organ transplants, two concert tours for the military troops in Iraq, Kuwait, and Afghanistan, Safe House, and many others. In addition to the hours for which he received recognition, he has donated instruments, music equipment, meaningful personal memorabilia, and some of his own paintings to be auctioned off for charities.\n\nBice started 2010 with an acoustic tour to introduce some newly written songs that he was recording for his upcoming album.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Bice's Sugar Money record label cooperated with [[Time Life]] for the album which was called ''3'', which was officially released on [[Saguaro Road Records]] on May 18, 2010.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} On October 12, 2010, Bice guest-starred on the syndicated game show ''[[Don't Forget the Lyrics!]]'' and won the $50,000 grand prize for his charity, [[MusiCares]].

The group originally formed as My Backyard and comprised [[Ronnie Van Zant]] (vocals), [[Gary Rossington]] (guitar), [[Allen Collins]] (guitar), [[Larry Junstrom]] (bass), and [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]] (drums). The band spent five years touring small venues under various names and with several lineup changes before deciding on \"Lynyrd Skynyrd\" in 1968. The band released its first album, ''[[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)]]'', in 1973. By then, they had settled on a lineup that included bassist [[Leon Wilkeson]], keyboardist [[Billy Powell]], and guitarist [[Ed King]]. Burns left and was replaced by [[Artimus Pyle]] in 1974. King left in 1975 and was replaced by [[Steve Gaines]] in 1976. At the height of their fame in the 1970s, the band popularized the [[Southern rock]] genre with songs such as \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\" and \"[[Free Bird]]\". After releasing five studio albums and one live album, the band's career was abruptly halted on October 20, 1977, when [[Lynyrd Skynyrd plane crash|their chartered airplane crashed]], killing Van Zant, Steve Gaines, and backup singer [[Cassie Gaines]], and seriously injuring the rest of the band.\n\nLynyrd Skynyrd reformed in 1987 for a reunion tour with Ronnie's brother, [[Johnny Van Zant]], as lead vocalist. They continued to tour and record with co-founder Rossington, Johnny Van Zant, and [[Rickey Medlocke]], who first wrote and recorded with the band from 1971 to 1972 before his return in 1996. Over the years, other founding members of the band have died either during\u2014or after\u2014their time in the band.

The Mods membership included J.R. Rice and Larry Steele. In early 1964, [[Ronnie Van Zant]] joined another local band, The Squires, that he soon renamed to Us. That year, at a local 'Battle of the Bands', Us performed against The Mods and won the competition. Van Zant, however, left Us shortly afterward. In the early summer of 1964, bassist [[Larry Junstrom]], drummer [[Bob Burns (drummer)|Bob Burns]], and guitarist [[Gary Rossington]] formed a trio called Me, You, and Him.{{efn|Rossington was the last to join\u2014at Burns' request.{{Citation needed|date=March 2023}} }}\n\nLater in the summer of 1964, teenagers Van Zant, Rossington, and Burns all became acquainted while playing on rival baseball teams. The trio decided to jam together one afternoon after Burns was injured by a ball hit by Van Zant. They set up their equipment in the carport of Burns' parents' house and played [[The Rolling Stones]]' hit \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\". Liking what they heard, they immediately decided to form a band. Bassist Larry Junstrom rounded out the lineup.

Armstrong left Hustlers shortly thereafter to start his own agency. Walden stayed with the band until 1974, when management was transferred to Peter Rudge. The band continued to perform throughout the South in the early 1970s, further developing their hard-driving [[blues rock]] sound and image, and experimenting with recording their sound in a studio. Skynyrd crafted this distinctively \"southern\" sound through a creative blend of country, blues, and a slight British rock influence.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/A2267092?q=lynyrd+skynyrd&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1| title=Oxford Music Online| website=Oxfordmusiconline.com}}</ref>\n\nDuring this time, the band experienced some lineup changes for the first time.

Kooper signed them to his Sounds of the South label, which was to be distributed and supported by [[MCA Records]], and produced their first album. Wilkeson, citing nervousness about fame, temporarily left the band during the early recording sessions, playing on only two tracks. He rejoined the band shortly after the album's release at Van Zant's invitation and is pictured on the album cover. To replace him, [[Strawberry Alarm Clock]] guitarist [[Ed King]] joined the band and played bass on the album (the only part that Wilkeson had not already written being the solo section in \"[[Simple Man (Lynyrd Skynyrd song)|Simple Man]]\"), and also contributed to the songwriting and did some guitar work on the album. After Wilkeson rejoined, King stayed in the band and switched solely to guitar, allowing the band to replicate its three-guitar studio mix in live performances. The band released their debut album ''[[(Pronounced 'L\u0115h-'n\u00e9rd 'Skin-'n\u00e9rd)]]'' on August 13, 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd Discography |publisher=Lynyrdskynyrd.com |access-date=September 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227083914/http://www.lynyrdskynyrd.com/board_posts/pronounced |archive-date=February 27, 2012}}</ref> It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book |first= Joseph |last= Murrells |year= 1978 |title= The Book of Golden Discs |edition= 2nd |publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location= London |page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330 1330] |isbn= 0-214-20512-6 |url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/1330}}</ref> The album featured the hit song \"[[Free Bird]]\", which received national airplay,<ref name=\"Butler, J.

Their 1974 follow-up album, ''[[Second Helping]]'', featuring King, Collins and Rossington all collaborating with Van Zant on the songwriting, cemented the band's breakthrough. Its single \"[[Sweet Home Alabama]]\", a response to [[Neil Young]]'s \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\", reached #8 on the charts that August. Young and Van Zant were not rivals, but fans of each other's music and good friends; Young wrote the song \"[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]\" for the band, but they never recorded it.<ref>Simmons, p. 135.</ref> During their peak years, most of their records sold over one million copies, but \"Sweet Home Alabama\" was the only single to crack the top ten.<ref name=\"Butler, J.

Midway through the ''Nuthin' Fancy'' tour, guitarist Ed King abruptly left the band after a falling out with Van Zant. King's guitar roadie and Van Zant were arrested together and spent the night in jail. With his guitar roadie unavailable, King played that night's show with old strings that broke and caused his performance to be substandard, and Van Zant subsequently belittled him in front of his bandmates. King quit and returned home to Los Angeles, believing Van Zant had been responsible for his guitar roadie being in jail in the first place.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" />\n\n[[File:Crowd at Knebworth House - Rolling Stones 1976.jpg|thumb|A crowd of 120,000 fans at Knebworth House in 1976]]\nCollins and Rossington both had serious car accidents over Labor Day weekend in 1976, which slowed the recording of the follow-up album and forced the band to cancel some concert dates. Rossington's accident inspired the ominous Van Zant/Collins composition \"[[That Smell]]\" \u2013 a cautionary tale about drug abuse that was clearly aimed towards him and at least one other band member. Rossington has admitted repeatedly that he was the \"Prince Charming\" of the song who crashed his car into an oak tree while drunk and stoned on [[Quaaludes]]. With the birth of his daughter Melody in 1976, Van Zant was making a serious attempt to clean up his act and curtail the cycle of boozed-up brawling that was part of Skynyrd's reputation.<ref name=\"kijak-documentary\" />\n\n[[File:Lynyrd Skynyrd (1977).jpg|thumb|right|Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1977]]\nThe ''[[Street Survivors]]'' album of 1977 turned out to be a showcase for guitarist/vocalist [[Steve Gaines]], who had joined the band just a year earlier and was making his studio debut with them.

As part of the settlement, Jenness and Rapp collect nearly 30% of the band's touring revenues (representing the shares their husbands would have earned had they lived), and hold a proviso requiring any band touring as Lynyrd Skynyrd to include Rossington and at least two of the other four surviving members from the pre-crash era, namely Wilkeson, Powell, King and Pyle.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.floridatrend.com/article/13369/lynyrd-skynyrd-unfynyshed-byzness |title=Lynyrd Skynyrd: Unfynyshed Byzness |newspaper=[[Florida Trend]] |accessdate= }}</ref> Following this rule, the band would have been forced to retire in 2001, but they have still continued to tour for another two decades.{{cn|date=June 2021}}\n\nThe band released its first post-reunion album in 1991, entitled ''[[Lynyrd Skynyrd 1991]]''.

The band consisted of [[Cody Canada]] (lead guitar/vocals), Grady Cross (guitar), [[Randy Ragsdale]] (drums), and Jeremy Plato (bass guitar). The group released five studio albums and three live albums from 1994 until 2010. The band was at the forefront of the rise of the red dirt music scene in Oklahoma and the Texas Music scene. After almost 15 years together, the group disbanded in 2010.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nCross Canadian Ragweed started when Randy Ragsdale met Cody Canada, Matt Weidemann, and Grady Cross, who had also been playing together. The four had known each other since grade school and started playing together in Ragsdale's home seven nights a week under the tutelage of Ragsdale's father, Johnny, who had worked with musical artists in the area. After playing together, the band officially formed by combining a part of every band member's last name, coming up with the name Cross Canadian Ragweed. Matt Weidemann left the band, and Jeremy Plato joined the band, playing the bass guitar. After finishing high school, the band moved to the [[College Town]] of [[Stillwater, Oklahoma]], where acts like Mike McClure's [[The Great Divide (band)|The Great Divide]] and singer-songwriter [[Jimmy LaFave]] had established enough of a local scene to earn Stillwater the nickname North Austin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/north_austin_stillwater_ok_nickname/|title=Barry Popik|website=Barrypopik.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===''Carney'' and ''Live And Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon''===\nThe group had already received significant [[college radio]] [[airplay (song)|airplay]] before it released its first album, ''Carney'' in 1998 on their own independent label. Initially, selling the band in the market it was based in, was considered by music observers to be far-fetched; however, the fan base's passion and loyalty to the band allowed them to find success in releasing that first album. Carney was well received, then the band released ''Live and Loud at the Wormy Dog Saloon'' in 1999, which was also well received, especially in the local scene.\n\n===''Highway 377''===\nRagweed released its second studio album Highway 377 in 2001, though it was recorded in 1999. It propelled them into wider audience and into [[Texas]], where Canada was born and also where the band had been touring heavily. Though not a released single, the song \"Long Way Home\" was featured on several [[Dodge]] Truck Commercials in both Texas and Oklahoma which added to the popularity of the band. The band paid tribute to drummer Randy Ragsdale's father Johnny, who has passed away from cancer in 1997 with the track \"Johnny's Song.\"\n\n===''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas''===\nIn 2002 Ragweed recorded the popular live album ''Live and Loud at Billy Bob's Texas'' in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. The songs were mainly live versions of songs off ''Carney'' and ''Highway 377'', with a handful of cover songs.\n\n===''Cross Canadian Ragweed (Purple Album)''===\nIn 2002, the group then signed with [[Show Dog Nashville|Universal South]] Records and released a self-titled album also alternately known as 'The Purple Album'.  It was a tribute to the band's \"little sister\" Mandy Ragsdale, the younger sister of the band's drummer Randy Ragsdale, who had died in an auto accident near [[College Station, Texas]], and whose favorite color was purple. The album produced charted singles \"17\" and the ballad \"Constantly\", and released a music video for the hard rock track \"Don't Need You.\"\n\n===''Soul Gravy''===\nRagweed's 2004 album, ''[[Soul Gravy]]'', debuted at No.&nbsp;4 on the Billboard charts. [[Lee Ann Womack]] provided background vocals on the popular single \"Sick and Tired\". The project also saw the re-release of the song \"Alabama\" (off of 2001's Highway 377) with a heavier electric sound, which appeared on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Charts]] as well.\n\n===''Garage''===\nIn October 2005 the band released ''Garage'', described by both the band and raters at [[AllMusic]] as the group's \"grungiest album ever.\" Two songs, \"Fighting' For\" and \"This Time Around\" both became hits off the album. The album charted higher than any studio album the band ever released and for the first time, the band broke into rock radio airplay across the United States due to the song \"Dimebag\", a tribute to former [[Damageplan]] and [[Pantera]] guitarist \"Dimebag\" [[Darrell Abbott]], who had been killed months earlier during a concert, in addition to a heavier rock sound overall.\n\n===''Back To Tulsa: Live And Loud At Cain's Ballroom''===\nIn late 2006, Ragweed released their third and final live album, ''Live and Loud At Cain's Ballroom'' in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]. The band's 24 song project was well received and featured songs from their previous projects The Purple Album, Soul Gravy, and Garage. It also featured a handful of covers as well such as [[Neil Young]]'s [[The Needle and the Damage Done]] and [[Robert Earl Keen]]'s \"Lonely Feeling.\"\n\n===''Mission California''===\nCross Canadian Ragweed recorded ''[[Mission California]]'', their fourth studio album, at the end of March 2007. The namesake of the album was due to the recording taking place in [[San Diego]], California. The band spent 25 days in the studio; the first 5 cutting 15 tracks, the next 20 polishing each. [[Lee Ann Womack]] once again laid down background vocals on 4 of the tracks to include the [[Chris Knight (musician)|Chris Knight]] cover \"Cry Lonely.\" ''[[Mission California]]'' was released on October 2, 2007. AllMusic reviewed the Album and found that the project was \"name appropriately, the band sounds much more a progressive West Coast sound in many of the tracks and less rural rock.\"\n\n===''Happiness and All the Other Things''===\nThe band's tenth and final album, ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was released on August 31, 2009, commemorating the band's 15th Anniversary. It featured 12 new studio tracks and three live tracks. Recorded in California, this album includes a track entitled \"51 Pieces\", which Canada penned with Micky Braun. The song was based on an incident where Ohio State police ransacked the band's bus after a stop in Cleveland at the [[House of Blues]]. It also featured \"Blue Bonnets\" which is dedicated to Cody's oldest son Dierks. ''[[Happiness and All the Other Things]]'' was officially dedicated to the late Randall Locke ([[Willie Nelson]]'s long-time stage manager) who suddenly died on May 6, 2009. Other popular tracks were \"To Find My Love\", \"Burn Like The Sun\", and \"Kick In The Head.\"\n\n=== Hiatus and band break-up ===\nIn May 2010, Cross Canadian Ragweed announced a hiatus from touring.  In a band press release, Ragsdale explained, \"Right now, I need to be at home for my family, particularly my son JC, who has autism. He's 10 years old now and still struggling in his development. I feel the only way I can help him is to be more hands on and close to home.\" Despite Ragsdale wanting to \"get another drummer and press on,\" Canada stated \"We\u2019ve always said from the start, we\u2019re Ragweed as the four of us, or not Ragweed at all.\"<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cross Canadian Ragweed cancels Oklahoma City Family Jam  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120701165713/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2010/05/28/cross-canadian-ragweed-cancels-oklahoma-city-family-jam-still-playing-sundays-music-and-mayhem-in-eufaula/  |archive-date=July 1, 2012  }}</ref> In September 2010, Canada officially announced the band was calling it quits by announcing their  \"Last Call Show\" in October 2010 at Joe's Bar in Chicago, IL, stating \"as far as that\u2019s concerned, Oct 24 is the last one, the last gig.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.caller.com/news/2010/sep/16/cross-canadian-ragweed-frontmans-career-evolves/|title=Cross Canadian Ragweed frontman's career evolves|website=Caller.com|access-date=April 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Post break-up ===\nSince Cross Canadian Ragweed, Canada and Plato formed [[The Departed (band)|The Departed]] with fellow [[Yukon, Oklahoma|Yukon]]-native Dave Bowen (drums), Seth James (guitar), and Steve Littleton (keyboards), releasing their debut album \"This Is Indian Land\" in June 2011.<ref>{{cite news  |title=Cody Canada & The Departed digging into red dirt roots with debut album, \"This Is Indian Land\"  |url=http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |url-status=dead  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707211521/http://blog.newsok.com/bamsblog/2011/06/17/cody-canada-the-departed-digging-into-red-dirt-roots-with-debut-album-this-is-indian-land/  |archive-date=July 7, 2012  }}</ref>\nRagsdale and Cross both returned to Yukon.

They were first active in the 1970s and reformed in 2007, and are best known for being the band which launched [[Tom Petty]] to fame.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mudcrutch-mw0000783357 | title=Mudcrutch - Mudcrutch &#124; Album &#124; AllMusic | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/2-mw0002938002 | title=2 - Mudcrutch &#124; Album &#124; AllMusic | website=[[AllMusic]] }}</ref>\n\nMudcrutch formed in Gainesville in 1970 and soon became a popular act across Florida. The band moved to Los Angeles in 1974 to attract the attention of a record company. Though they signed a contract with [[Shelter Records]], they released only one poor-selling single before breaking up in 1975. The following year, former Mudcrutch members Petty, [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]], and [[Benmont Tench]] formed the core of a new band, the Heartbreakers.\n\nMost of the original Mudcrutch lineup reformed in 2007 to record their first album as a group, which was followed by a tour. A second album followed in 2016. Petty's death in 2017 effectively dissolved the group; Leadon died in 2023.\n\n== History ==\n=== 1970\u20131975 ===\nMudcrutch was formed in 1970 by [[Gainesville, Florida]], residents [[Tom Petty]] and [[Tom Leadon]] (brother of [[Bernie Leadon]] from [[The Eagles (band)|the Eagles]]), then teenagers, who had been playing together in a group called the Epics. Mudcrutch's lineup consisted of Petty (bass and vocals), Leadon (guitar and vocals), Jim Lenahan (vocals), Randall Marsh (drums) and [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] (guitar). Lenahan was initially the band's lead vocalist, but Petty very quickly also started singing lead on some songs.  \n\nThis incarnation of Mudcrutch issued a locally distributed single (\"Up In Mississippi\"/\"Cause Is Understood\") in 1971, with Petty writing and singing both songs. Leadon and Lenehan left the band in 1972 and were replaced by bassist/guitarist/vocalist Danny Roberts and keyboardist [[Benmont Tench]]. Ricky Rucker was a part of the band for a short time. Mudcrutch became locally popular and regularly played gigs from central Florida to southern Georgia. In Gainesville, they had a long stint as the house band at Dub's Lounge and organized several well-attended music festivals at \"Mudcrutch Farm\", a run-down house on a large lot where several band members lived.<ref>{{cite web|first=Amy|last=Reinink|url=http://www.gainesville.com/news/20080608/whats-left-of-the-mudcrutch-farm |title=What's left of the Mudcrutch Farm?  |website=Gainesville.com |access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref>\n[[File:Campbell autograph.jpg|left|thumb|\"Depot Street\" [[gramophone record|vinyl]], signed by [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]]]]\nIn 1974, the members of Mudcrutch decided to relocate to [[Los Angeles]] to try to sign with a major record label. After several rejections, they signed with [[Leon Russell]]'s independent [[Shelter Records]]. The band released one single, \"Depot Street\" in 1975, which failed to chart. After Danny Roberts left the group, Petty invited [[Charlie Souza]] to take over on bass guitar and the band continued recording in Leon Russell's [[The Church Studio|Tulsa studio]], and later at his [[Encino, California]], home. Discouraged by the group's lack of success, the record company broke up Mudcrutch in late 1975, keeping only Petty under contract. Several months later, Petty regrouped with former Mudcrutch members Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench to form [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers|the Heartbreakers]] along with fellow Gainesville natives [[Stan Lynch]] (drums) and [[Ron Blair]] (bass).<ref>DeYoung, Bill. \"Tom Petty: Full Steam Ahead\" ''Goldmine'' July 13, 1990: 18\u201330</ref>\n\n=== Reformation: 2007\u20132017 ===\nIn August 2007, Tom Petty invited Randall Marsh and Tom Leadon, original members of Mudcrutch, to reunite with Heartbreakers Benmont Tench and Mike Campbell to reform Mudcrutch. They recorded an album, ''[[Mudcrutch (album)|Mudcrutch]]'', which was released on April 29, 2008, by [[Reprise Records]], and contains 14 old and new tracks. \"We would play and then we would just talk about the old days,\" said Leadon. The band toured briefly in California to promote the album throughout April and the beginning of May 2008. The album hit number 8 on the [[Billboard 200]] albums chart.<ref name=\"billboard1\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/311924/mudcrutch/chart |title=Mudcrutch \u2013 Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=March 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFans who bought tickets to the tour through [[Ticketmaster]] were given six free downloads from the album.\n\nOn November 11, 2008, a live EP titled ''[[Extended Play Live]]'' was released. All tracks were recorded live in April 2008. On the same day American music channel [[VH1 Classic]] broadcast a documentary about the band.\n\n[[File:Mudcrutch, June 2016.jpg|thumb|250px|Mudcrutch, performing in June 2016]]\nAccording to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Mudcrutch intended to reconvene August 2015 to begin work on a new album. The group was originally going to begin work on the album in January of that year, but things were pushed back eight months due to medical issues that rhythm guitarist Tom Leadon was experiencing.<ref>{{cite magazine|title = Tom Petty's Pre-Fame Band Mudcrutch to Record New Album|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-pettys-pre-fame-band-mudcrutch-to-record-new-lp-20150602|magazine = Rolling Stone|access-date = October 9, 2015}}</ref> In February 2016, prior to the announcement that they were releasing a second album, Mudcrutch was announced as a headliner for both the 2016 Bunbury Music Festival in Cincinnati, Ohio, and the 2016 Summer Camp Music Festival in Chillicothe, Illinois.\n\nThe band's second full-length album, ''2'', was released May 20, 2016, on Reprise Records. Preceding the album's release was a single, \"Trailer\", as well as \"Beautiful World\" and \"Hungry No More\". The album hit number 10 on the [[Billboard 200]] albums chart.<ref name=\"billboard1\" /> Less than three days after the album was released, the band embarked on their first national tour in support of the album. The tour began the same way their 2008 tour did: with two benefit shows for the Midnight Mission (on May 23 and 24, 2016, in Los Angeles). [[Herb Pedersen]], who is also credited on ''2'', joined Mudcrutch on the tour.\n\nPetty died on October 2, 2017, of [[cardiac arrest]], while Leadon died on March 22, 2023, of natural causes.<ref>[https://wbsm.com/ixp/295/p/tom-leadon-dead/ Tom Leadon, Mudcrutch Co-Founder, Dead at 70]</ref> Both deaths effectively ended the possibility of any further Mudcrutch activity.\n\n== Personnel ==\n=== Band members ===\n* [[Tom Petty]] \u2013 bass (1971\u20131974, 2007\u20132017; his death), backing vocals (1971\u20131973, 2007\u20132017), lead vocals, harmonica (1971\u20131975, 2007\u20132017), rhythm guitar (1973\u20131975), keyboards (1971\u20131973)\n* [[Mike Campbell (musician)|Mike Campbell]] \u2013 lead guitar (1971\u20131975, 2007\u20132017), occasional lead vocals (2015\u20132017)\n* [[Tom Leadon]] \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1971\u20131972, 2007\u20132017; died 2023), occasional lead vocals (2007\u20132017)\n* Jim Lenahan \u2013 lead vocals (1971\u20131972)\n* [[Benmont Tench]] \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals (1973\u20131975, 2007\u20132017), occasional lead vocals (2007\u20132017)\n* Randall Marsh \u2013 drums (1971\u20131975, 2007\u20132017), occasional lead vocals (2015\u20132017)\n* Danny Roberts \u2013 rhythm guitar, bass, backing vocals (1973\u20131974)\n* [[Charlie Souza]] \u2013 bass (1974\u20131975)\n\n==== Timeline ====\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize  = width:800 height:auto barincrement:22\nPlotArea   = left:100 bottom:130 top:15 right:15\nAlignbars  = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1970 till:10/02/2017\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nLegend     = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:3\nScaleMajor = increment:5 start:1970\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1970\n\nColors = \n id:vocals value:red         legend:Lead_vocals\n id:lgtr   value:teal        legend:Lead_guitar\n id:rgtr   value:brightgreen legend:Rhythm_guitar,_backing_vocals\n id:keys   value:purple      legend:Keyboards,_backing_vocals\n id:bass   value:blue        legend:Bass\n id:drums  value:orange      legend:Drums\n id:harm   value:tan2        legend:Harmonica\n id:album  value:black       legend:Studio_albums\n\nBarData =\n bar:Jim     text:\"Jim Lenahan\"\n bar:Petty   text:\"Tom Petty\"\n bar:Mike    text:\"Mike Campbell\"\n bar:Leadon  text:\"Tom Leadon\"\n bar:Danny   text:\"Danny Roberts\"\n bar:Ben     text:\"Benmont Tench\"\n bar:Charlie text:\"Charlie Souza\"\n bar:Randall text:\"Randall Marsh\"\n\nLineData = \n color:album layer:back\n at:04/29/2008\n at:05/20/2016\n\nPlotData = \n bar:Jim     from:start      till:01/01/1973 color:vocals width:11\n bar:Petty   from:start      till:01/01/1973 color:bass   width:11\n bar:Petty   from:start      till:01/01/1973 color:keys   width:3\n bar:Petty   from:01/01/1973 till:12/31/1975 color:vocals width:11\n bar:Petty   from:01/01/1973 till:12/31/1975 color:harm   width:7\n bar:Petty   from:01/01/1973 till:12/31/1975 color:rgtr   width:3\n bar:Petty   from:01/01/1973 till:09/01/1974 color:bass   width:5\n bar:Petty   from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:bass   width:3\n bar:Petty   from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:vocals width:11\n bar:Petty   from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:harm   width:7\n bar:Mike    from:start      till:12/31/1975 color:lgtr   width:11\n bar:Mike    from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:lgtr   width:11\n bar:Mike    from:01/01/2015 till:end        color:vocals width:3\n bar:Leadon  from:start      till:01/01/1973 color:rgtr   width:11\n bar:Leadon  from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:rgtr   width:11\n bar:Leadon  from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:vocals width:3\n bar:Danny   from:01/01/1973 till:09/01/1974 color:rgtr   width:11\n bar:Danny   from:01/01/1973 till:09/01/1974 color:bass   width:3\n bar:Charlie from:09/01/1974 till:12/31/1975 color:bass   width:11\n bar:Ben     from:01/01/1973 till:12/31/1975 color:keys   width:11\n bar:Ben     from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:keys   width:11\n bar:Ben     from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:vocals width:3\n bar:Randall from:start      till:12/31/1975 color:drums  width:11\n bar:Randall from:08/01/2007 till:end        color:drums  width:11\n bar:Randall from:01/01/2015 till:end        color:vocals width:3\n}}\n\n== Discography ==\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+\n!
