His sound was influenced by his musician father and uncles and the extensive record collection that his father kept.\n\nHoge attended [[Western Kentucky University]] to study history, planning to become a high school history teacher and basketball coach.  He decided that he wanted to try his hand at [[rock and roll]] and began writing music.  Will left the university after realizing he wanted to be a musician.\n\n==Early band==\nWill released an early [[extended play|EP]] of original music with his band Spoonful in the mid-1990s.  However, the band was not picked up and eventually disbanded.  Some of these early songs were recycled on later albums, and are still hits with his loyal followers.\n\n==Solo artist==\n[[File:Will Hoge Concert.jpg|thumb|left|Hoge in concert, September 25, 2010 in Nashville]]With former [[The Georgia Satellites]] guitarist [[Dan Baird]] in tow, Hoge began touring the American south.  He independently released his first [[compact disc|CD]], ''Live At The Exit/In'', a live set recorded at the Nashville club.  His original sound drew much attention and, through constant touring, he was able to release his first studio album, ''Carousel''.\n\nHoge caught the attention of [[Atlantic Records]] music executives and he was signed to a record deal in early 2002.  Atlantic then re-released ''Carousel'' to a wider market.  His 2003 major label debut, ''Blackbird On A Lonely Wire'' was a cleaner sounding effort; however, the album was poorly promoted by Atlantic.  Eventually, Hoge asked for and received a release from his contract, re-obtaining the rights to ''Carousel''.\n\nThe support of his fans has given Hoge the ability to tour incessantly, and self-release a couple live albums (2004's ''Almost Alone: Live At Smith's Olde Bar''' and 2005's ''During the Before and After''), a politically charged album called ''The America EP'' (which included a cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are A-Changin']])\", and a bluesy rock and roll sounding album, ''The Man Who Killed Love''.\n\nOver the years, Hoge has toured with many artists, including [[Midnight Oil]], [[Shinedown]], [[Needtobreathe]], [[Marc Broussard]], [[ZZ Top]], [[The Cat Empire]], [[Squeeze (band)|Squeeze]], [[Jason Isbell]], [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Edwin McCain]].  Bands that have opened for him include [[Steel Train]], [[The Trews]], [[The Elms (band)|The Elms]], [[Rose Hill Drive]], [[Needtobreathe]], [[Moses Mayfield]], [[The Alternate Routes]], [[Aslyn]], [[Katie Herzig]], [[Missy Higgins]], and [[The Civil Wars]].\n\nHoge recorded the opening theme song, \"You Make Me Happy,\" for the [[CBS]] sitcom ''[[Still Standing (American TV series)|Still Standing]]''.\n\nOn February 20, 2007, he released a live album, ''Again Somewhere Tomorrow'', from recordings made during the band's two-night stint at the Exit/In in Nashville, in September 2006.\n\nThe band's fourth studio album, ''Draw the Curtains'', was released nationwide in October 2007 by [[Rykodisc Records]]. The album was initially released as a [[CD]], with a limited edition 180-Gram [[Vinyl Record]] version which followed later.\n\nFollowing a scooter accident in August 2008, the band went on hiatus for seven months while Hoge recuperated from his injuries.  In April 2009, the band got together for a 3-week acoustic tour of venues in the Midwest, Southeast and East Coast, hitting cities including New York City, Chicago, Nashville and Atlanta.  When the tour ended in late April, the band headed back into the studio to complete recording their next album (of which they had begun at the time of Hoge's accident).  Ken Coomer and Charlie Brocco again produced, and the album, ''The Wreckage'', was released on September 29, 2009.\n\nWill Hoge performed a residency at 12th & Porter in [[Nashville, tn|Nashville, TN]] in June 2010.  During these concerts, many of Hoge's friends, family, and former bandmates joined him on stage during the run of the four shows.  These guests included former guitarists [[Dan Baird]], Brian Layson, and Jason 'Slim' Gambill; former keyboard players Jefferson Crowe and John Lancaster; as well as Will's own father, who sang lead vocals on the final song of the concert series.\n\nOn August 29, 2009, Will and the band appeared and performed the single \"[[Even If It Breaks Your Heart]]\" on the [[CBS Early Show]] as the music guest.\n\nHoge opened for [[Needtobreathe]] on their spring 2010 tour.  He also opened shows for [[Sugarland]] and [[Michelle Branch]] on select dates during their summer tour.\n\nHoge was part of a line-up, which included [[Keith Urban]], [[Dierks Bentley]], and [[Sheryl Crow]], that performed on the nationally televised \"[[Music City Keep On Playin']]\" flood relief program that aired on [[Great American Country|GAC]] on May 16, 2010.  Hoge closed the show by performing his song \"Washed By The Water.\"\n\nHoge opened for mainstream rock band [[Shinedown]] on their acoustic \"Anything & Everything\" tour in the fall of 2010.\n\nIn September 2011, Hoge released his 7th studio album entitled 'Number Seven'.  The album was his third release via Ryko.  This time around, Hoge took over production duties for the entire album.  The album's first single \"When I Get My Wings\" was released to radio in August 2011.  The official music video for the song was added into rotation on both [[VH1]] and [[Country Music Television|CMT]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0EIxUWO_0M&ob=av2n |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2016-01-04}}{{cbignore}}{{Dead YouTube link|date=February 2022}}</ref>  During this time, Hoge was invited to perform on three separate occasions at the [[Grand Ole Opry]], with country legend [[Vince Gill]] playing guitar and singing background vocals on a couple songs during his first appearance (Gill is a guest artist on 'Seven' as well, as he and his wife, [[Amy Grant]] are fans of Hoge).\n\nIn a September 2012 blog post on his website, Hoge announced a number of changes.  He left Rykodisc Records after releasing three albums with them. Longtime drummer Sigurdur 'Siggi' Birkis was released from the band.  They have yet to hire a permanent replacement.  He also announced in a Twitter post that [[Lady Antebellum]] was recording a cover of his song \"Better Off Now\" from his 2003 release \"Blackbird On A Lonely Wire\" which will be included on their next album.\n\nIn October 2012, Hoge announced, via Twitter, than he has signed a songwriting deal with BMG Nashville.\n\nHoge received a Country Music Association nomination, an Academy of Country Music nomination and a Grammy nomination for \"Country Song of the Year\" for \"Even If It Breaks Your Heart\". The song was recorded by the Eli Young Band and reached #1 on the country charts.\n\nIn 2013, he released ''[[Never Give In (Will Hoge album)|Never Give In]]''.  The album debuted at 129 on the Billboard 200, his highest debut on the chart, selling 3,000 copies in the US.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://roughstock.com/news/2013/10/13907-country-album-chart-news-the-week-of-october-23-2013-scotty-mccreery-willie-nelson-duets-chase-rice-cassadee-pope-lead/ |title= Country Album Chart News: The Week of October 23, 2013: Scotty McCreery, Willie Nelson Duets, Chase Rice, Cassadee Pope Lead|author= Matt Bjorke |date= October 23, 2013 |work=Roughstock }}</ref> The album's final track \"Strong\" was featured in a television commercial for Chevy trucks and contributed to the album's success.\n\nOn April 7, 2015, Hoge released his album ''Small Town Dream''.

He also toured with punk rock band Social Distortion after lead singer Mike Ness heard Hoge on satellite radio, thanks to a free subscription with his new car.  Ness invited Hoge to tour together.<ref>as told by Hoge and Ness in Toronto, ON 2018-10-10</ref>\n\nHoge's next album, ''Tiny Little Movies'', was released in June 2020. His latest effort, ''Wings On My Shoes'', is slated for release on 26 August 2022.\n\n==Motorcycle accident==\nHoge was involved in a motorcycle accident on August 20, 2008 after leaving a studio session for what would be his next album, \"The Wreckage.\" He was traveling north on Main Street in [[East Nashville]] at about 8 p.m. when a van traveling southbound failed to yield while turning into 712 Main St.  Hoge's motorcycle collided with the passenger side of the van. He was admitted to [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] in critical condition.  He went into surgery immediately upon arrival at the hospital for numerous broken bones (ribs, sternum, shattered femur, knee cap, shoulder blades), and lacerations to his face, arms, and torso requiring over 200 stitches.  Hoge's condition was upgraded to stable on August 22.<ref name=\"tennessean.com\"/>  No evidence was found that alcohol or drugs were involved in the accident.<ref>[http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080821/TUNEIN/80821015 ]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the year following the accident, Hoge went through numerous surgical procedures (mainly on his shattered femur/leg) and intensive physical therapy.  Work on ''The Wreckage'', as well as tour dates, were postponed through spring 2009.

His family relocated to the [[Midland\u2013Odessa]] area of [[West Texas]], before eventually moving to [[Houston]]. He attended high school primarily in Houston at [[Westfield High School (Harris County, Texas)|Westfield High School]].\n\nBingham's mother purchased his first guitar when he was 16 years old. Although he was fascinated by music, he left his guitar dormant in his closet. Roughly a year later, Bingham hitchhiked back west to [[Laredo, Texas]], in hopes of landing a job with his father, carrying the guitar with him on the trip. Bingham's father enjoyed having neighbors over on their porch to drink beer, and one of them taught him a classical Mariachi song called \"La Malaguena\" in segments. Though he loved playing the song, it was the only one he would learn during his time in Laredo.\n\nHe relocated to [[Stephenville, Texas]]. There, he began learning more music while also riding on the rodeo team at [[Tarleton State University]]. It was in Stephenville that he would write arguably his most well-known hit \"Southside of Heaven\" in a trailer house. He also began to play local gigs there, namely a local golf course and a few small bars.\n\nWhile in Stephenville, Bingham had a friend who caught wind of a job in [[Paris]], France, with the Wild West Show at the [[Disney Parks, Experiences and Products|Disney Resort]]. He bought a one-way ticket with $100 in his pocket. Upon arrival, he was informed that the manager with whom he had a mutual friend was no longer with the company, and he found himself stranded with his guitar and old rigging bag from his rodeo days. Luckily, he found some friends-of-friends within the Disney programs and began playing music in local parks for tips.\n\nEventually, he saved enough money to get back to Texas and moved in with a rodeo buddy near [[Fort Worth]]. His friend had a brother (Matthew \"Papa\" Smith) who cut hair during the day and played drums as a hobby. After an introduction and impromptu gig at an empty bar in Fort Worth, he and Papa would go on to be the founding members of Ryan Bingham and the Dead Horses.<ref name=3DotMag>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PLUyADYR_w|title=Ryan Bingham Interviewed by 3DotMag|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> [[Marc Ford]] of the [[Black Crowes]] was one of the few people in the bar that night.

John Timmins was a member of the band but left the group before the recording of their debut studio album.<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\"/> The band line-up has never changed since, although they use several guest musicians on many of their studio albums, including multi-instrumentalist Jeff Bird who has performed on every album except the first.\n\nCowboy Junkies' 1986 debut studio album, produced by Canadian producer [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], was the [[blues]]-inspired ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'', recorded in the family garage using a single [[Ambisonics|ambisonic]] microphone.<ref name=EMC/>\n\nThe band gained wide recognition with their second studio album, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), recorded in 1987 at Toronto's [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]]. Their sound, again with [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] using the ambisonic microphone, and their mix of [[blues]], [[country music|country]], [[American folk music|folk]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[jazz]] earned them both critical attention and a strong fan base. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' named the recording one of the 10 best albums of 1988.<ref name=EMC/> \n\nCowboy Junkies have gone on to record 16 studio albums and five live albums, with tour dates booked into 2024.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tour |url=https://cowboyjunkies.com/tour/ |website=Cowboy Junkies |access-date=24 November 2023}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== Early history===\nAlan Anton and Michael Timmins, lifelong friends who met in kindergarten, formed their first band in high school. In 1979, influenced by [[post-punk]] bands such as [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] and [[Joy Division]], they recruited drummer Geoff Railton and vocalist Liza Dawson-Whisker, and formed Hunger Project in Toronto.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/whitesoff/open.html |title=Whites Off Earth Now {{!}} Backstory |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=January 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190117122349/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/whitesoff/open.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017152650/https://littlevillagemag.com/prairie-pop-an-interview-with-michael-timmins-of-the-cowboy-junkies/ |title=An interview with Michael Timmins of the Cowboy Junkies |work=Little Village |date=October 23, 2013 |archive-date=October 17, 2015 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=McLeod, Kembrew |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-01-01-ca-236-story.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029134019/http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-01/entertainment/ca-236_1_country-music |title=The Cowboy Junkies' Addicting Vision : At its best, the band plays country music with a Velvet Underground twang |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 1, 1989 |archive-date=October 29, 2015 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Hilburn, Robert |url-status=live }}</ref> They moved to [[Manhattan]]'s [[Lower East Side]] and performed at a variety of clubs. In early 1981, the Hunger Project embarked on a multi-city tour of the United States. After that, Hunger Project moved to the United Kingdom, where they toured for three months and released the single \"The Same Inside/Assembly\" on their independent label, [[Latent Recordings]].<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch:80/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511211421/http://www.mypage.bluewin.ch/palesun/articles/CBJ86promo.html |title=1986 promo sheet |website=palesun's Cowboy Junkies fan pages |date=May 11, 2006 |archive-date=May 11, 2006 |access-date=April 26, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWhen Hunger Project disbanded, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins remained in London and started an improvisational band named Germinal. The members \u2013 Michael Timmins on guitar, Alan Anton on bass, a drummer, and saxophonist, played whatever they wished on their instruments at the same time. Germinal released two studio albums: ''Germinal 1'' (1983) and ''Din'' (1984). The music newspaper [[New Musical Express]] said Germinal \"ranks among the most innovative and aggressive sounds to emerge from the independent scene this year.\" Alan Anton and Michael Timmins had a somewhat different take, saying, \"It was the ultimate release for us. But for the audience, it was quite a chore.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/literature-and-arts/music-popular-and-jazz-biographies/cowboy-junkies |title=Cowboy Junkies |website=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=June 11, 2018}}</ref> In London, they developed journeyman skills as musicians, and expanded their knowledge of music history \u2014 Michael Timmins worked in a record store for a year to make ends meet while with Germinal. Among those who were to influence Michael Timmins and Alan Anton were jazz musicians [[Cecil Taylor]], [[Ornette Coleman]], [[John Coltrane]], along with the sound of early blues musicians [[Lightnin' Hopkins]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Bukka White]], and [[Robert Johnson]].<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> Germinal broke up after three years in autumn of 1984. Alan Anton moved to Berlin and Michael Timmins returned to New York City.<ref name=\"86 Promo sheet\"/>\n\nUpon their return to Toronto in 1985, Alan Anton and Michael Timmins rented a house, insulated the tiny garage, and, with younger brother Pete Timmins sitting in on drums, began exploring a new musical direction. Margo was drafted to join and recalls, \"I was contemplating going on to graduate school, staying in school. That was safe. I never wanted to be a musician or be onstage.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> Nevertheless, Michael Timmins began to hear something in what they were doing with their initial jams, realizing that a female voice was what the band needed. Michael Timmins said, \"I thought if you had this female voice on top of it, you could do anything you wanted.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\nHowever, the slow musical tempos and whispery, hushed tones that defined their early work was not just musical inspiration, but came about by necessity. Their recording studio was their repurposed garage, which was just behind the house and bordered closely with their neighbours. On their first jam session, the police showed up due to a noise complaint from the neighbour.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> According to Michael Timmins, \"We realized we had to tone down. One thing fed into the other: Margo began to realize that her singing voice was more effective quiet. We began to realize, if we can get down underneath Margo, the sound will be more effective. Pete picked up brushes \u2013 he was just learning to play drums at that point. Everything sort of came down. We learned to play with less volume.\"<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\nWhen the unnamed band was preparing for its first gig, the members considered various names before choosing Cowboy Junkies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8828140/Cowboy-Junkies-QandA-with-Margo-Timmins.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8828140/Cowboy-Junkies-QandA-with-Margo-Timmins.html |archive-date=January 12, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Cowboy Junkies: Q&A with Margo Timmins |work=The Telegraph |date=October 17, 2011 |access-date=June 11, 2018 |author=Chilton, Martin}}{{cbignore}}</ref> During their early gigs the band would perform at [[The Rivoli]] which had a small space in the back. The group would perform a rhythmic groove while Margo sang improvised vocal melodies and portions of old blues songs. Many times the Junkies entire performance would be a single jam session.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/>\n\n[[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]], a recording enthusiast who had ambitions of becoming a producer, was at their first show. According to Moore, \"I was mesmerized by Margo. The very first show, people weren't paying attention to them, because they were playing so softly and quietly.

They met Peter Moore at a dinner party, and when they began talking about recording equipment and techniques, they found that Moore's interest in single-microphone recording meshed with their desire to capture the intimate sound of their rehearsal garage.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.masslive.com/entertainment/index.ssf/2018/04/cowboy_junkies_reflect_on_30_y.html |title=Cowboy Junkies reflect on 30 years before Northampton show |work=Mass Live |date=April 4, 2018 |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=Lenker, George}}</ref> Moore had just purchased a Calrec [[Ambisonics|Ambisonic]] microphone at the wholesale price of $9,000.<ref name=\"Cold Dawn\"/> The Cowboy Junkies and Moore came together at the rehearsal space on June 26, 1986, and turned the garage into a recording studio. Moore arranged the group around his Calrec, jury-rigged a control room in the kitchen, and started recording.<ref name=\"Sound on Sound\">{{cite web |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/cowboy-junkies-sweet-jane |title=Cowboy Junkies 'Sweet Jane' |work=Sound on Sound |access-date=April 27, 2018 |date=October 2015 |author=Doyle, Tom}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies shopped their material but were unable to find a label to distribute their work, so they revived the indie label [[Latent Recordings]] that Michael Timmins and Anton had used for their Hunger Project and Germinal works, and released ''[[Whites Off Earth Now!!]]'' in October 1986. They sold 3,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Barclay, Michael |author2=Jack, Ian A.D. |author3=Schneider, Jason |year=2001 |title=Have Not Been The Same: The Canrock Renaissance, 1985-1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLIiOE_jCpAC&q=cowboy+junkies+peter+moore+1985&pg=PT528 |location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada |publisher=ECW Press|isbn=9781554909681 }}</ref> The band then toured the US. Michael Timmins described the experience: \"While touring ''Whites'' we had spent a lot of time in the Southern states, especially Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas. For some reason the club owners down there took a liking to what we were doing so we spent a lot of time crossing the kudzu choked highways that ran through the heart of the old Confederacy. Those were the days when having to spend a night in a hotel room would mean the difference between eating the next day or paying for the gas to get us to the next town, so we spent a lot of our time sleeping on the floors of friendly promoters, fans, waitresses and bartenders.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/blog/archives/4313 |title=A Look Back At\u2026.The Trinity Session (history \u2013 part 1 of 3) |website=Latent Recordings |date=November 6, 2014 |access-date=April 4, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael |archive-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427190815/http://latentrecordings.com/blog/archives/4313 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe band's next project, ''[[The Trinity Session]]'' (1988), became their breakthrough. Peter Moore again produced the album. They approached the project as a reaction against the [[MIDI]]\u2013dominated musical styles of the '80s. Moore said, \"I was angry that music had gotten into drum machines and MIDI. No humanity, no nothing. I'm listening to these recordings from the '50s with two or three mics and I'm going, 'Man that's real music.'\" He chose the [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Church of the Holy Trinity]] in Toronto for its natural reverb. To better persuade the officials of the historic church, Moore claimed \"The Timmins Family Singers\" were recording a Christmas special.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/trinitysession/index8.html |title=Trinity Sessions {{!}} Page 8 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=Timmins, Michael }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The session began early on November 27, 1987. Songs with the fewest instruments were recorded first, and then the songs with gradually more complex arrangements. In this way Moore was able to solve acoustic problems one by one. To better balance Margo's vocals against the electric guitars and drums, she was recorded through a PA system left behind by a previous group. By making subtle changes in volume and placement relative to the microphone over six hours, Moore and the band finally reached the distinctive sound of the album.<ref name=\"Sound on Sound\"/>\n\nMusic critic for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, [[Anthony DeCurtis]], summed up the result of the group's efforts in a four-star review of the album: \"The Trinity Session is in the great tradition of albums that establish a mood and sustain it so consistently that the entire record seems like one continuously unfolding song. The mood in this instance is hypnotic and introspective \u2013 an intense, melancholic longing that blends the elemental emotions of country music and the blues with the poetic world-weariness of [[the Velvet Underground]]. [...] Having good songs, the skill to convey what they have to say and, most important, a vision, the Cowboy Junkies dispensed with high-tech trumpery and made their record simply and seriously. That attitude helped make the album as important as it is inspiring.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/rollingstone_tts.html |title=Rolling Stone Review of The Trinity Session |website=Junkies Fan |date=February 9, 1989 |access-date=June 12, 2018 |author=DeCurtis, Anthony |archive-date=June 12, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612172429/http://www.junkiesfan.com/articles/rollingstone_tts.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe album was included in the book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 albums you must hear before you die |date=2006 |publisher=Universe |editor=Dimery, Robert. |isbn=0789313715 |location=New York, NY |oclc=63515375}}</ref>\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe band's third studio album was more challenging, requiring three attempts to get the sound the band desired. Yet despite the problems with the making of it, the band considers it a very exciting and turbulent time in their career and state that ''[[The Caution Horses]]'' (1990) remains one of their favourite albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index2.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 2 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=April 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428093807/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index2.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band rented a small recording studio in the docklands of Toronto with the intention of using the room like the garage their debut studio album was recorded in, instead of a room with live acoustics like the church room they used for ''The Trinity Session'' (1988). The session went badly because the group had just come off the road after a gruelling tour and were tired, particularly Margo Timmins who had a terrible head cold. After a few hours they realized the session wasn't working out, and they left.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index3.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 3 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe second attempt was made on April 21 of 1987 when [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]] rented the [[Sharon Temple]], an historic landmark located in the village of Sharon, Ontario. Michael Timmins recalls, \"The arrangements that we had developed for this new set of songs were at times so full and lush, unlike the spareness of most of Trinity's songs, that we were immediately confronted with the problem of how to control this swirl of sound so that it didn't just turn to mush on tape. Another problem was that the Temple was a lot more acoustically lively than any of us had imagined. As a result when the music swelled it would often spill over into Margo's vocal mic and feedback.\" At the end of three days during which the temperature would drop below freezing,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index4.html |title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Caution Horses {{!}} Page 4 |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304105425/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/cautionhorses/index4.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Michael Timmins states, \"When we packed up and left Sharon that day I don't think that any of us felt that we had captured anything special.

As the band listened, new ideas for them evolved. They also wrote additional songs.

Alan Anton recalls, \"We found Rock Island, named not for music but for geology. It is actually one big rock with stuff growing on it and has one small house with a great stone fireplace.

The Junkies moved into the rented home in the suburbs of Athens in June 1995. The producer and engineer John Keane had built a homey but state-of-the-art studio, and the band settled in quickly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index3.html|title=Cowboy Junkies {{!}} Lay It Down {{!}} Page 3|website=Latent Recordings|access-date=April 28, 2018|archive-date=February 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100203191541/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/layitdown/index3.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies' last studio album of the decade is an [[alternative country]] album, ''[[Miles from Our Home]]'' (1998).

During that time, Margo and Peter Timmins and Alan Anton would come down to work on songs.

While they were on a tour to support their live album ''[[Waltz Across America]]'', which lasted nine months and had many breaks in the schedule, they began working on new material. They added two to three new songs a month into their performances, allowing the songs to evolve on stage. During breaks, they would go to sound engineer Daryl Smith's studio, Chemical Sound, to live record material they had created.  Being able to set up in a couple hours, record some tracks, and be done by the end of the day was a departure from their habit of trying to complete an album's worth of songs in a set recording period. On each visit, they would record two or three songs. They also took the opportunity to re-record songs. After the band had recorded fifteen tracks, they listened and decided they had the songs they needed, with two additional songs recorded at [[Peter J. Moore|Peter Moore]]'s home studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/open/open_index.htm |title=Cowboy Junkies :: Open |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=April 28, 2018 |author=Anton, Alan |archive-date=March 27, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327204516/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/open/open_index.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n''[[One Soul Now]]'' (2004) was recorded over the course of a year, from October 2002 to October 2003. Its central idea is that everyone is interconnected. When the band returned home after their Open Tour, they decided to turn their rehearsal area into a recording studio which they dubbed The Clubhouse. This new arrangement changed the process of how they created their tracks. Previously, they would start in the rehearsal space, determine how the songs would work, then go to a studio. Now, the band recorded everything as they worked through the rehearsal process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/onesoulnow/osn_album.swf |title=Cowboy Junkies One Soul Now |website=Latent Recordings |access-date=June 19, 2018 |archive-date=July 9, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709235334/http://latentrecordings.com/cj_exclusives/onesoulnow/osn_album.swf |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Cowboy Junkies next project was ''[[Early 21st Century Blues]]'', which was recorded February through March 2005, and released in August of that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r787136 |title=Early 21st Century Blues - Cowboy Junkies |website=AllMusic |access-date=April 28, 2018}}</ref> It was begun a few months after their previous tour.

In order to expand upon the goal of reinterpreting, the Cowboy Junkies invited three guest musicians whose work has affected the Cowboy Junkies, and whose work and lives were affected by the album. Guest musicians on the 2007 album include [[Natalie Merchant]], [[Vic Chesnutt]], and [[Ryan Adams]]. Each does lead vocal on one of the album's songs (Merchant on \"To Love Is to Bury\", Chesnutt on \"Postcard Blues\", and Adams on \"200 More Miles\"). They also perform on other tracks.

Directors Pierre and Fran\u00e7ois Lamoureux, produced and recorded the album and the films.

About halfway through the visit, Timmins was introduced to Eric Chen, who was passionate about music, and became Timmins' friend. Chen brought Timmins a variety of CDs and videos that showcased the Chinese rock scene.<ref name=\"Renmin Park\"/>\n\nMichael asked his brother, Peter Timmins, to send him a high-end portable recorder, which he carried everywhere he went, and recorded music, conversations, exercise classes, badminton games, traffic, students chatter in classrooms, street hawkers, and more. He sent the recordings to Joby Baker in British Columbia with instructions to create loops of the sounds, and to use his imagination. The core of the album is built around a fictional love story between two people who live in different worlds that always keep them apart.

Though some of the band members have changed through the years, Carbon Leaf has been consistently creating and performing music since the early 1990s. The band currently consists of founding members Barry Privett, Carter Gravatt, and Terry Clark, as well as Jon Markel and Jesse Humphrey. Carbon Leaf is best known for the song \"Life Less Ordinary\", which debuted in 2004 and reached #5 on Billboard's [[Adult Alternative Songs|Adult Alternative]] charts.\n\n==History==\n===1992\u20132004: The Constant Ivy Music years===\n[[Image:Carbon Leaf (Barry Privett) in Cleveland, OH Grog Shop.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Barry Privett]]\nCarbon Leaf got their start at [[Randolph-Macon College]] in [[Virginia]] in 1992, practicing in an auditorium on campus. Their next step was playing backyard parties, mixers, fraternity, and sorority parties. Shortly after everyone graduated, they moved to [[Richmond, Virginia]]. From Richmond, they played the college circuit in Virginia and up the East Coast before moving on to clubs. Their style is not \"Brazilian Polka Metal\", despite the joking claims of guitarist Carter Gravatt (B., David. 2002).<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bluetintmagazine.com/protected/interviews/leaf.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040814181900/http://www.bluetintmagazine.com/protected/interviews/leaf.htm |title=Carbon Leaf Interview -Chicago, 2002 |work=Blue Tint Magazine |archive-date=August 14, 2004}}</ref>\n\n''[[Meander (album)|Meander]]'', their first album, was released in 1995.

They were mastered by [[Grammy]] award winner Charlie Pilzer. As with ''Look Out!'' in 2007, all songs were engineered by Bryan Hoffa, archival audio restoration specialist at the [[Library of Congress]]. The titles, bestowed by Ferd Lionel Moyse IV were inspired by the fact that these were the last two recording projects to come out of the old Sound Of Music facility, which has recently moved to a new building in Richmond.\n\n=== ''Charismo'' (2016) ===\nThe group released ''Charismo'' through Free Dirt Records in 2016, after almost a decade without putting together a studio album. Larry Campbell produced. Glide Magazine said of the album that the group take \"a tack similar to that of Old Crow Medicine Show, the [[Punk Brothers]], [[The Howlin' Brothers]] and other modern outfits that draw from the past to make an impression in the present.\" They went on to say that theirs is \"a sound once heard on back porches throughout the heartland, now brought to life with the stirring enthusiasm of would-be rock stars performing for appreciative audiences.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://glidemagazine.com/159799/hackensaw-boys-keep-fiddles-banjos-high-harmonies-potent-charismo-album-review/|title=Hackensaw Boys Keep Fiddles, Banjos & High Harmonies Potent on 'Charismo' (ALBUM REVIEW) - Glide Magazine|date=2016-04-22|work=Glide Magazine|access-date=2017-06-24|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=. . when we were making this record, we realized that the only true constant in this band from the very first tour on to the present day has been the charismo. So that is what we named the new record, because it personifies our work ethic. It's like -- you have to put something together, then try to maintain it, find new players for it. You know, its like holding something together that looks like it could fall apart, and that is what this band has been about.<ref name=\"Brexit\" />}}'''<big>New Material - Lineup Change (2018-2019)</big>'''\n\nIn January of 2018, the band saw the exit of Ferd Moyse and Brian Gorby, to focus on family and other musical projects. Face to face with the possibility and fear of having to hang it all up, David recruited long-time friend and former band-mate from a previous project, Beau Dodson for charismo, drums/percussion and vocals. Chris Stevens, who had sat in on bass for Hackensaw in the past, was brought on full time, adding bass to the line-up once again after a stint without. To round out the new line-up, Chris recommended his astonishingly talent band-mate and pal Caleb Powers for fiddle and vocals. In December of 2018 the reformed team entered the studio to record a five song EP, due to be released in the spring of 2019. \n\n==Charismo (the instrument)==\n\n[[Image:Charismo player The Hackensaw Boys Legacy Credit Union Stage Birmingham AL June 2008.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Justin Neuhardt on charismo with The Hackensaw Boys, Legacy Credit Union Stage--Birmingham, Alabama June 15, 2008.]]\n\nA distinctive aspect of the Hackensaw live-performance experience is the percussion instrument known as a \"charismo\". Invented and played by former band member Justin \"Salvage\" Neuhardt, who also performed on [[Spoon (musical instrument)|spoons]] and the [[musical saw]], it is described as \"a home-made tin can contraption.\"<ref name=\"The Hackensaw Boys\"/> As founder Sickmen remembers it:\n\n{{quote|Just before we went out on a 6-week tour, Justin came to us and said, \"I can't come on tour for 6 weeks JUST playing the spoons,\" but at the time we didn't want a drummer with a full kit, so I said to him, \"Why don't you just make something up?\" So he did! He came back with the very first Charismo, which he'd made out of tin cans, hub caps, and general scrap he'd found around the diner. It was pretty primitive, but when he hit it with those metal brushes and I heard that train sound, I knew it was what we wanted.\"<ref name=\"Brexit\" />}}\n\nCalvin James Pynn of The Tartan ([[Radford University]]) states \"Neuhardt's charismo\" is the \"most notable\" of the group's instruments:\n\n{{quote|. . a homemade [[percussion]] instrument made from tin cans, license plates, a hubcap, and book bag straps, and then mercilessly beat with wire-brush sticks.

With funk influences, Gorby uses the charismo to bring a rambunctious flair to the band's old-time style.\n\n==Musical style==\n\n{{Quote|When we typically do our shows, there's the raucous and the wild show and then we hop off the microphones and do acoustic songs.

Williams had recorded several moderately successful albums and was signed as a songwriter to Warner/Chappell; White had independently released ''The Long Goodbye''\u2014which was originally set to be released through a deal with Capitol Records\u2014and was writing for EMI Music.  At the workshop, approximately 25 songwriters were assembled by music publishers to write [[hit singles|radio singles]] for an unnamed band later identified as the country group [[Gloriana (band)|Gloriana]].  Williams and White were randomly paired to write together, and quickly discovered an affinity.  In a 2012 interview, Williams said that \"when he started singing it was like I knew where he was going to go before he went there.\"  In the same interview, White said that when he and Williams \"started singing together, there was this weird click; it was like there was a dance going where I knew I could lead her but she could lead me, too.\" Following the workshop, White and Williams made immediate plans to meet again.  They wrote the song \"Falling\" during their first session, which took place at Williams' house.<ref name=\"How We Met\">{{cite news|last1=Richman|first1=Simmy|title=How We Met: Joy Williams & John Paul White|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/how-we-met-joy-williams--john-paul-white-7574200.html|access-date=August 27, 2014|work=The Independent|date=March 18, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Nashville Scene - Long Bio\">{{cite news|last1=Gold|first1=Adam|title=How The Civil Wars fought for artistic independence and broadsided Music Row|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/how-the-civil-wars-fought-for-artistic-independence-and-broadsided-music-row/Content?oid=2673301|access-date=August 30, 2014|publisher=Nashville Scene|date=November 10, 2011|archive-date=August 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808042903/http://www.nashvillescene.com/nashville/how-the-civil-wars-fought-for-artistic-independence-and-broadsided-music-row/Content?oid=2673301|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLooking for a name for the project, Williams came up with the Civil Wars, which has no historical meaning, but rather is based on the quote \"be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a great battle\" attributed to [[Ian Maclaren]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/06/29/be-kind/|accessdate=29 September 2021|title= Be Kind; Everyone You Meet is Fighting a Hard Battle|website=[[Quote Investigator]]|date=June 29, 2010 }}</ref> According to Williams, \"as I was thinking about the music we make, that sense of battle seemed applicable.\"<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|last1=McKinley|first1=James C.|title=Their Year of Living Almost Famously|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/arts/music/talking-to-joy-williams-and-john-paul-white-of-the-civil-wars.html|access-date=August 30, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=October 25, 2011}}</ref>  The duo performed for the first time as The Civil Wars at the French Quarter Cafe in Nashville on April 7, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reverte|first1=Michelle|title=Interview: Joy Williams and John Paul White of The Civil Wars|url=http://laist.com/2011/06/13/the_civil_wars.php|website=laist.com|publisher=The LAIST|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=June 13, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609031600/http://laist.com/2011/06/13/the_civil_wars.php|archive-date=June 9, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>  Williams' former producer [[Charlie Peacock]] was in attendance, and impressed by their dynamics and on-stage chemistry, began working with them the following day.<ref name=\"Charlie Peacock Interview\">{{cite web|last1=Inglis|first1=Sam|title=The Civil Wars chose to avoid the usual studio trickery for their debut album, and have reaped great success as a result.|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr12/articles/the-civil-wars.htm|website=soundonsound.com|publisher=Sound on Sound|access-date=August 29, 2014|date=April 2012}}</ref>  On April 8, 2009, Shalom Aberle recorded The Civil Wars' second live show, opening for [[Will Hoge]] at [[Eddie's Attic]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Civil Wars - Live at Eddie's Attic (Credits)|url=http://www.discogs.com/Civil-Wars-Live-At-Eddies-Attic/release/2745375|website=discogs.com|date=June 30, 2009 |publisher=Discogs|access-date=September 1, 2014}}</ref> Eight of the songs that were recorded that night were on ''[[Live at Eddie's Attic]]'', which was released through Sensibility Music on June 30, 2009 as a free download on The Civil Wars' website.

She is recognized for having a consistent artistic direction. Harris is considered one of the leading music artists behind the [[country rock]] genre in the 1970s and the [[Americana (music)|Americana]] genre in the 1990s. Her music united both country and rock audiences in live performance settings. Her characteristic voice, musical style and songwriting have been acclaimed by critics and fellow recording artists.\n\nHarris developed an interest in folk music in her early years, which led to her performing professionally. After moving to New York City in the 1960s, she recorded a folk album and performed regionally. She was discovered by [[Gram Parsons]], who influenced her country rock direction. Following his 1973 death, Harris obtained her own recording contract from [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]\u2013[[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] Her second album, ''[[Pieces of the Sky]]'' (1975), found both critical acclaim and commercial success. Follow-up 1970s albums further elevated Harris' career, such as ''[[Elite Hotel]]'' (1976), ''[[Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town]]'' (1978) and ''[[Blue Kentucky Girl (Emmylou Harris album)|Blue Kentucky Girl]]'' (1979). By 1980, she had acquired four number-one songs on the US and Canadian country charts: \"[[Together Again (Buck Owens song)|Together Again]]\", \"[[Sweet Dreams (Don Gibson song)|Sweet Dreams]]\", \"[[Two More Bottles of Wine]]\" and \"[[Beneath Still Waters (song)|Beneath Still Waters]]\".\n\nHarris had a continued string of commercially and critically successful albums like ''[[Roses in the Snow]]'' (1980), ''[[Evangeline (Emmylou Harris album)|Evangeline]]'' (1981) and ''[[Last Date (Emmylou Harris album)|Last Date]]'' (1982). Her backing group, the Hot Band helped establish a musical foundation for her concerts and albums. Her 1980s albums spawned the top ten singles \"[[The Wayfaring Stranger (song)|Wayfaring Stranger]]\", \"[[Born to Run (Emmylou Harris song)|Born to Run]]\" and \"[[Last Date (song)|Last Date]]\". The 1985 album ''[[The Ballad of Sally Rose]]'' was among Harris' first self-written projects. The album (along with its follow-ups) failed to sustain the commercial momentum of previous albums. Harris then collaborated with [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] on ''[[Trio (1987 album)|Trio]]'' (1987). The platinum-selling album was also a critical success that spawned four top ten singles.\n\nIn 1992, Warner Bros. released the live album ''[[At the Ryman]]''. It garnered critical praise and renewed interest in its live venue, the [[Ryman Auditorium]]. Harris was inspired to move in a new musical direction with 1995's ''[[Wrecking Ball (Emmylou Harris album)|Wrecking Ball]]''. She then reunited with Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt for ''[[Trio II]]'' (1999). By the 2000s, Harris had signed with [[Nonesuch Records]] and recorded several albums of self-composed material like ''[[Red Dirt Girl]]'' (2000), ''[[All I Intended to Be]]'' (2008) and ''[[Hard Bargain (Emmylou Harris album)|Hard Bargain]]'' (2011). She also found collaborative partnerships, such as with [[Mark Knopfler]] on the internationally successful ''[[All the Roadrunning]]'' (2006). She then collaborated with Rodney Crowell on the critically acclaimed ''[[Old Yellow Moon]]'' (2013) and ''[[The Traveling Kind]]'' (2015). She also became involved in activism during this time, including starting her own [[Animal rescue group|dog rescue]] called Bonaparte's Retreat.\n\nHarris has been estimated to have sold over 15 million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sturges |first1=Fiona |title=Emmylou Harris: 'I smoked country music but I didn't inhale' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/emmylou-harris-i-smoked-country-music-but-i-didn-t-inhale-2267867.html |access-date=August 2, 2023 |work=[[The Independent]] |date=April 17, 2011 |archive-date=August 2, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230802031020/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/emmylou-harris-i-smoked-country-music-but-i-didn-t-inhale-2267867.html |url-status=live }}</ref> She has also earned 13 [[Grammy Awards]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Emmylou Harris: Artist |url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/emmylou-harris/13460 |website=[[Grammy Awards]] |access-date=August 2, 2023 |archive-date=July 5, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705191559/https://www.grammy.com/artists/emmylou-harris/13460 |url-status=live }}</ref> placed 27 singles into the top ten of the US [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]],<ref name=\"Country Songs\">{{cite magazine |title=Emmylou Harris chart history (Country Songs) |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/emmylou-harris/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=July 18, 2023 |archive-date=April 4, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404170929/https://www.billboard.com/artist/emmylou-harris/chart-history/csi/ |url-status=live }}</ref> and several of her albums have received [[Recording Industry Association of America|gold]] certifications in the US.<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum: Emmylou Harris |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=emmylou+harris#search_section |website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |access-date=July 26, 2023}}</ref> She was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2008 and was ranked among ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2022.\n\n==Early life==\nHarris was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1947.{{sfn|Bufwack|Oermann|p=363}} She was one of two children born to Walter Rutland Harris and Eugenia Harris.<ref name=\"eugenia\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?n=eugenia-m-harris&pid=172203831&fhid=11637 |title=Eugenia Harris Obituary (1921 - 2014) - Nashville, TN |date=August 22, 2014 |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=July 12, 2021 |via=legacy.com |archive-date=May 10, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210510144304/https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/washingtonpost/obituary.aspx?n=eugenia-m-harris&pid=172203831&fhid=11637 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"bucky\">{{cite web |url=https://www.moaa.org/content/about-moaa/scholarship-fund/faces-of-donorsFolder/Maj--Walter-Rutland-%E2%80%9CBucky%E2%80%9D-Harris,-USMC-Ret- |title=Maj.

He is a multi-instrumentalist but is best known for his [[slide guitar]] work, his interest in [[traditional music]], and his collaborations with traditional musicians from many countries.\n\nCooder's solo work draws upon many genres. He has played with [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Ali Farka Tour\u00e9]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Neil Young]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Vishwa Mohan Bhatt]], [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], [[the Chieftains]], [[Warren Zevon]], [[Manuel Galb\u00e1n]], [[the Doobie Brothers]], [[Little Feat]], and [[Carla Olson|Carla Olson and the Textones]] (on record and film).

Parks arranged Cooder's \"One Meatball\" according to Parks' 1984 interview with Bob Claster.\n\nCooder was a [[session musician]] on various recording sessions with [[the Rolling Stones]] in 1968 and 1969, and his contributions appear on the albums ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' ([[Yank Rachell|Yank Rachell-style]] [[mandolin]] on \"[[Love in Vain]]\"), and ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'', on which he contributed the slide guitar on \"[[Sister Morphine]]\". During this period, Cooder joined with [[Mick Jagger]], [[Charlie Watts]], [[Bill Wyman]], and longtime Rolling Stones [[sideman]] [[Nicky Hopkins]] to record ''[[Jamming with Edward!]]''. Cooder also played slide guitar for the 1970 film soundtrack ''[[Performance (soundtrack)|Performance]]'', which contained Jagger's first solo single, \"[[Memo from Turner]]\". The 1975 [[compilation album]] ''[[Metamorphosis (Rolling Stones album)|Metamorphosis]]'' features an uncredited Cooder contribution to Bill Wyman's \"Downtown Suzie\".\n\nCooder also collaborated with [[Lowell George]] of [[Little Feat]], playing [[slide guitar|bottleneck guitar]] on the original version of \"[[Willin' (Little Feat song)|Willin']]\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/little-feat-mw0000653350/credits|title=Little Feat \u2013 Little Feat &#124; Credits|website=AllMusic |access-date=February 5, 2010}}</ref> He also played bottleneck guitar and mandolin on two tracks on the Gordon Lightfoot album ''[[Sit Down Young Stranger]]'' (later re-titled ''If You Could Read My Mind''), recorded in late 1969 and released in early 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rylanders.free-online.co.uk/RySite/RyPages/SitDownStranger.html |title=Gordon Lightfoot Sit Down Young Stranger |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=Rylanders: Ry Cooder Discography|access-date=September 18, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===1970s===\nThroughout the 1970s, Cooder released a series of [[Warner Bros. Records]] albums that showcased his guitar work, initially on the [[Reprise Records]] label, before being reassigned to the main Warners label along with many of Reprise's artists when the company retired the imprint. Cooder explored bygone musical [[genres]] and found old-time recordings which he then personalized and updated. Thus, on his breakthrough album, ''[[Into the Purple Valley]]'', he chose unusual instrumentations and arrangements of blues, gospel, [[calypso music|calypso]], and country songs (giving a tempo change to the cowboy ballad \"Billy the Kid\"). The album opened with the song \"How Can You Keep on Moving (Unless You Migrate Too)\" by [[Agnes \"Sis\" Cunningham]] about the [[Okie]]s who were not welcomed when they migrated west to escape the [[Dust Bowl]] in the 1930s \u2013 to which Cooder gave a rousing-yet-satirical march accompaniment. In 1970 he collaborated with Ron Nagle and performed on his ''Bad Rice'' album released on Warner Brothers. His later 1970s albums (with the exception of ''[[Jazz (Ry Cooder album)|Jazz]]'', which explored ragtime/vaudeville) do not fall under a single genre description, but his self-titled first album could be described as blues; ''Into the Purple Valley'', ''[[Boomer's Story]]'', and ''[[Paradise and Lunch]]'' as [[folk music|folk]] and blues; ''[[Chicken Skin Music]]'' and ''Showtime'' as a mix of [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]] and [[Hawaiian music|Hawaiian]]; ''[[Bop Till You Drop]]'' as 1950s [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]; and ''[[Borderline (Ry Cooder album)|Borderline]]'' and ''Get Rhythm'' as rock-based.

He also played guitar on [[Judy Collins]]' 1970 concert tour, and is featured on ''[[Living (Judy Collins album)|Living]]'', the 1971 live album recorded during that tour. He also learned from and performed with [[Gabby Pahinui]] and [[Leland Isaacs, Sr.|\"Atta\" Isaacs]] in Hawaii during the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]] of the early 1970s. He is also credited for guitars on several 1971 recordings by [[Nancy Sinatra]] that were produced by Andy Wickman and Lenny Waronker \u2013 \"Is Anybody Goin' To San Antone\", \"Hook & Ladder\", and \"Glory Road\". Cooder is credited as a mandolin player on Gordon Lightfoot's ''[[Don Quixote (album)|Don Quixote]]'' album in 1972.\n\n===1980s===\nCooder has worked as a studio musician and has also scored many [[film soundtrack]]s including the [[Wim Wenders]] film ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'' (1984). Cooder based this soundtrack and title song \"Paris, Texas\" on [[Blind Willie Johnson]]'s \"[[Dark Was the Night (Cold Was the Ground)]]\", which he described as \"the most soulful, transcendent piece in all American music\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/blindwilliejohnson_092803.html;COXnetJSessionID=1ITtL0zcaTYPiiTPLjP1a2lrfOo25kwasby2KrVda2n1BrlyX13b!-615020192?urac=n&urvf=10701094852420.8419290445454791\"|title=The Soul of Blind Willie Johnson:Retracing the life of the Texas music icon|author=Corcoran, Michael|website=Austin360.com|access-date=September 5, 2011|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819061919/http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/blindwilliejohnson_092803.html|archive-date=August 19, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Musician [[Dave Grohl]] has declared Cooder's score for ''Paris, Texas'' one of his favorite albums.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYG5eRoSTJwC&pg=PA57 |page=57| last=Greenwald |first=Andy |title=The Chosen Foo|journal=Spin|date=August 2005}}</ref> In 2018 Cooder told [[BBC Radio 4]] listeners: \"[Wenders] did a very good job at capturing the ambiance out there in the desert, just letting the microphones and the [[Nagra|nagra machine]] roll and get tones and sound from the desert itself, which I discovered was [[E\u266d tuning|E\u266d]], was in the key of E\u266d \u2013 that's the wind, you know, was nice.

His other film work includes [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[The Long Riders]]'' (1980), ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'' (1981), ''[[Streets of Fire]]'' (1984), ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'' (1985), ''[[Johnny Handsome]]'',<ref>''Johnny Handsome:Original Motion PictureSoundtrack'', Warner Bros.

In 1988, Cooder produced the album by his longtime backing vocalists [[Bobby King]] and [[Terry Evans (musician)|Terry Evans]] on [[Rounder Records]] titled ''Live and Let Live''. He contributed his slide guitar work to every track. He also plays extensively on their 1990 self-produced Rounder release ''Rhythm, Blues, Soul & Grooves''. Cooder's music also appeared on two episodes of the television program ''Tales From the Crypt'': \"The Man Who Was Death\" and \"The Thing From the Grave\".<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/original-music-from-tales-from-the-crypt-w93724 Review of ''Tales From the Crypt''] by Steven McDonald, ''AllMusic.com''</ref>\n\nIn 1984, Cooder played on two songs on the debut album by Carla Olson & the Textones, ''Midnight Mission'' \u2013 \"Carla's Number One is to Survive\" and the previously unreleased [[Bob Dylan]] song \"Clean Cut Kid\". Shortly thereafter he was writing and recording the music for the film ''Blue City'' and asked the band to appear in the film performing. (He took them to the studio and produced \"You Can Run\" which he also played on.)\n\nIn 1985, Cooder was a guest artist on the song \"Rough Edges\" from [[Kim Carnes]]' album ''[[Barking at Airplanes]]''. Kim named her son Ry as a tribute to Ry Cooder.\n\nAlso in 1988, Cooder produced and featured in the [[Les Blank]]-directed concert documentary film ''Ry Cooder & The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let's Have a Ball'' where he plays in collaboration with a selection of musicians famous in their various musical fields.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0170532/|title=Ry Cooder & The Moula Banda Rhythm Aces: Let's Have a Ball (1988)|author=RondoHatton|date=August 31, 1991|work=IMDb|access-date=January 7, 2015}}</ref> The following year, he played a janitor in the [[Jim Henson]] series ''[[The Ghost of Faffner Hall]]'', in the episode \"Music Is More Than Technique\".<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/JvLkt_0dPP8 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130709013916/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvLkt_0dPP8 Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvLkt_0dPP8 |title=The Jim Henson Company YouTube Channel |publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=January 12, 2012 |access-date=June 10, 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref>\n\n===1990s===\nIn the early 1990s, Cooder collaborated on two [[world music]] \"crossover\" albums, which blended the traditional American musical genres that Cooder has championed throughout his career with the contemporary improvised music of India and Africa. For ''[[A Meeting by the River]]'' (1993), which also featured his son [[Joachim Cooder]] on percussion, he teamed with [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani]] classical musician [[Vishwa Mohan Bhatt|V.M. Bhatt]], a virtuoso of the [[Mohan Veena]] (a modified 20-string [[archtop guitar]] of Bhatt's own invention) and Sukhvinder Singh Namdhari also known as Pinky Tabla Player.\n\nIn 1993 he teamed up with [[Mali]] a multi-instrumentalist [[Ali Farka Toure]] to record the album ''[[Talking Timbuktu]]'', which he also produced. The album, released in 1994, also featured longtime Cooder collaborator [[Jim Keltner]] on drums, veteran blues guitarist [[Clarence \"Gatemouth\" Brown]], jazz bassist [[John Patitucci]] and African percussionists and musicians including [[Hamma Sankare]] and Oumar Toure. Both albums won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Global Music Album|Best World Music Album]] in 1994 and 1995 respectively. Cooder also worked with [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] [[Overtone singing|throat singers]] for the score to the 1993 film ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]''.\n\nIn 1995 he performed in ''[[The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True]]'', a musical performance of the popular story at the [[Lincoln Center]] in New York to benefit the [[Children's Defense Fund]]. The performance was originally broadcast on both TBS and TNT. It was issued on CD and video in 1996.\n\nIn the late 1990s Cooder played a significant role in the increased appreciation of traditional [[Cuba]]n music, due to his collaboration as producer of the ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (album)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1997) recording, which became a worldwide hit and revived the careers of some of the greatest surviving exponents of 20th century Cuban music. [[Wim Wenders]], who had previously directed 1984's ''[[Paris, Texas (film)|Paris, Texas]]'', directed a documentary film of the musicians involved, ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'' (1999), which was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 2000.<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/176586/Buena-Vista-Social-Club/details |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208064255/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/176586/Buena-Vista-Social-Club/details |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 8, 2007 |department=Movies & TV Dept. |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007 |title=NY Times: Buena Vista Social Club |access-date=November 22, 2008}}</ref> The enterprise cost him a $25,000 fine for violating the [[United States embargo against Cuba]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/mar/04/jazz.popandrock|work=[[The Guardian]]|title=Interview \u2013 From the Dust|date=March 3, 2007|access-date=May 27, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-feb-06-ca-21581-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|title=With Help From Up High, Cooder's Back in Cuba|author= Hancock, Jay|date=February 6, 2001|access-date=December 1, 2022}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nCooder's 2005 album ''[[Ch\u00e1vez Ravine (album)|Ch\u00e1vez Ravine]]'' was touted by his [[record label]] as being \"a post-World War II-era American narrative of 'cool cats', radios, UFO sightings, J.

Ch\u00e1vez Ravine, where the sidewalk ends.\"<ref name=Nonesuch/> Drawing from the various musical strains of Los Angeles, including [[conjunto]], R&B, Latin pop, and jazz, Cooder and friends conjure the ghosts of Ch\u00e1vez Ravine and Los Angeles at mid-century. On this fifteen-track album, sung in Spanish and English, Cooder is joined by [[East Los Angeles, California|East L.A.]] legends like Chicano music patriarch [[Lalo Guerrero]], [[Pachuco]] boogie king [[Don Tosti]], [[Thee Midniters]] front man Little Willie G, and Ersi Arvizu, of The Sisters and [[El Chicano]].\n\nCooder's next record was released in 2007. Entitled ''[[My Name Is Buddy]]'', it tells the story of Buddy Red Cat, who travels and sees the world in the company of his like-minded friends, Lefty Mouse and Rev. Tom Toad. The entire recording is a parable of the working class progressivism<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7719791|title=Cooder's 'Buddy' Revives Tales of a Bygone America|publisher=NPR Music|date= March 6, 2007 |access-date=August 30, 2011}}</ref> of the first half of the American twentieth century, and even has a song featuring executed unionist [[Joe Hill (activist)|Joe Hill]]. ''My Name Is Buddy'' was accompanied by a booklet featuring a story and illustration (by [[Vincent Valdez]]) for each track, providing additional context to Buddy's adventures.\n\nCooder produced and performed on an album for [[Mavis Staples]] entitled ''[[We'll Never Turn Back]]'', which was released on April 24, 2007. The [[concept album]] focused on [[Gospel music|Gospel]] songs of the [[civil rights movement]] and also included two new original songs by Cooder.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56405/mavis-staples-gets-personal-on-anti-debut|title=Mavis Staples Gets Personal On Anti-Debut|author1=Cohen, Jonathan  |author2=Martens, Todd |name-list-style=amp |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=December 19, 2006|access-date=August 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nCooder's album ''[[I, Flathead]]'' was released on June 24, 2008. It is the completion of his California trilogy. Based on the [[drag racing]] culture of the early 1960s, the album is set on the desert salt flats in southern California. The disc was also released as a deluxe edition with stories written by Cooder to accompany the music.\n\nIn late 2009, Cooder toured Japan, New Zealand, and Australia with [[Nick Lowe]], performing some of Lowe's songs and a selection of Cooder's own material, mainly from the 1970s. Joaquim Cooder (Ry's son) provided percussion, and [[Juliette Commagere]] and [[Alex Lilly]] contributed backing vocals.\n\nThe song \"Diaraby\", which Cooder recorded with [[Ali Farka Tour\u00e9]], is used as the theme to ''[[The World (radio program)|The World]]'s'' Geo Quiz. ''The World'' is a radio show distributed by [[Public Radio International]].\n\nIn 2009, Cooder performed in ''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian [[Howard Zinn]]'s ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''. Cooder performed with Bob Dylan and Van Dyke Parks on the documentary broadcast on December 13, 2009, on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. They played \"[[Do Re Mi (Woody Guthrie song)|Do Re Mi]]\" and reportedly a couple of other [[Woody Guthrie|Guthrie]] songs that were excluded from the final edit. He also traveled with the band [[Los Tigres del Norte]] and recorded the 2010 album ''[[San Patricio (album)|San Patricio]]'' with the Chieftains, [[Lila Downs]], [[Liam Neeson]], [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Van Dyke Parks]], [[Los Cenzontles]], and Los Tigres.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/05/24/100524fa_fact_wilkinson |title=Onward and Upward with the Arts, \"Immigration Blues\"|author= Wilkinson, Alec |magazine=The New Yorker|date=May 24, 2010|access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1069640/the-chieftains-featuring-ry-cooder-san-patricio|title=The Chieftains featuring Ry Cooder, \"San Patricio\"|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author= Wood, Mikael|date=March 5, 2010 |access-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===2010s===\n[[File:Ry Cooder 19Aug2015 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Cooder playing the electric [[bouzouki]] in August 2015]]\nIn June 2010, responding to the passage of [[Arizona SB 1070]], he released the single \"Quicksand\", which tells the story of Mexicans attempting to emigrate to Arizona through the desert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/ry-cooders-quicksand-response-arizona-immigration-law-available-itunes-proceeds-donated-maldef-2010-06-29|title=Ry Cooder's 'Quicksand', Response to Arizona Immigration Law, Now Available on iTunes; Proceeds Donated to MALDEF|publisher=Nonesuch Journal, [[Nonesuch Records]]|date=June 29, 2010|access-date=April 2, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2010-06-28-playlist29_N.htm|work=USA Today|title=The playlist: Sia's 'Fight,' Marah's 'Problem,' Cooder's 'Quicksand'|author= Gundersen, Edna|date= June 28, 2010|access-date=April 2, 2011}}</ref>\nCooder's critically acclaimed<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-ry-cooder-pull-up-some-dust-and-sit-down-nonesuch-2347604.html|title=Album: Ry Cooder, Pull Up Some Dust And Sit Down (Nonesuch)\n|author= Gill, Andy|work=The Independent |date= September 2, 2011|access-date=September 4, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/01/ry-cooder-pull-up-review|title=Ry Cooder: Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down \u2013 review|author=Spencer, Neil|work=The Guardian |date=September 4, 2011|access-date =September 4, 2011}}</ref> new album ''[[Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down]]'', released on August 30, 2011, contains politically charged songs such as \"No Banker Left Behind\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15037331|title=Ry Cooder takes on the bankers|author= Stanbridge, Nicola ([[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today programme]]) |work=[[BBC Online]]|date= September 24, 2011|access-date=September 25, 2011}}</ref> which was inspired by a [[Robert Scheer]] column.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.marketplace.org/2011/08/29/life/art-money/ry-cooder-protest-songs-today |title=Ry Cooder on the protest songs of today |journal=Marketplace |publisher=American Public Media |date=August 29, 2011 |access-date=May 8, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, he published a collection of short stories called ''[[Los Angeles Stories]]'', written about people living in Los Angeles in the 1940s and 1950s. The book's characters are mostly talented or skilled, clever or hardworking people living in humble circumstances.  With story titles such as \"La vida es un sue\u00f1o\" and \"Kill me, por favor\", the collection's stories often have a Hispanic theme, and the book deals partially with Latinos living in Los Angeles during this time.\n\nAn ''[[American Songwriter]]'' article in 2012 suggested that Cooder's recent string of solo albums have often taken on an allegorical, sociopolitical bent. Music journalist Evan Schlansky said that \"Cooder's latest effort, ''[[Election Special]]'' (released August 21, 2012, on Nonesuch/Perro Verde) doesn't mince words.

She signed with [[MCA Nashville]] in 1997 and made her debut on the U.S. [[Billboard Country Chart]] with the release of her debut single, \"A Soft Place to Fall\", which she co-wrote with [[Gwilym Emyr Owen III|Gwil Owen]]. The song was featured in [[Robert Redford]]'s ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'' and was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in 1999. Moorer performed at the Oscars ceremony the same year. She has made ten albums and her songs have been recorded by [[Trisha Yearwood]], [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Miranda Lambert]], [[Steve Earle]], and [[Hayes Carll]].\n\n== Early life ==\nMoorer was born in [[Mobile, Alabama]] on June 21, 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allison-moorer.com/bio.html|title=Biography|website=Allison-moorer.com|access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref> She was raised in [[Frankville, Alabama]], and later [[Monroeville, Alabama]], after the deaths of her parents. Growing up, Moorer and her sister also lived in [[Jackson, Alabama]] at various times.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moorer|first=Allison|title=Blood: A Memoir|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-306-92268-8}}</ref>  Music was an important part of the Moorer family. Moorer's father was a heavy drinker who abused his wife. In 1985, her mother fled with the two girls to nearby Mobile, but her father soon discovered their whereabouts. In 1986, when Moorer was 14 and her older sister Shelby (now [[Shelby Lynne]]) was 17, he shot and killed his wife before taking his own life.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/15/132082946/shelby-lynne-and-allison-moorer-musical-sisters | title=Shelby Lynne and Allison Moorer: Musical Sisters | publisher=NPR | date=December 15, 2010}}</ref> Moorer graduated from the [[University of South Alabama]] in Mobile in June 1993 and then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], without even collecting her diploma to join her sister, singer/songwriter Shelby Lynne, who lived there and had already released three albums. Moorer began singing backgrounds in Lynne's band full time and toured extensively with her.\n\n== Career ==\nIn June 1996, Moorer took part in a tribute to her songwriter friend, the late [[Walter Hyatt]], singing his \"Tell Me Baby\" at Nashville's [[Ryman Auditorium]]. Nashville agent Bobby Cudd was in attendance and subsequently introduced her to renowned producer and MCA Nashville president [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]]. After a few meetings, Brown asked her to cut some demos for the label. Two tracks\u2014\"Pardon Me\" and \"Call My Name\"\u2014 from that session were included on her first MCA album, ''[[Alabama Song (album)|Alabama Song]]''.\n\nWhen Brown moved from [[MCA Records]] to sister label [[Universal South]], Moorer followed. Her 2002 album, ''[[Miss Fortune (album)|Miss Fortune]]'', earned more raves, but didn't meet sales expectations. It contained the ballad \"Tumbling Down,\" which was featured on the soundtrack of the popular 2002 film ''[[The Rookie (2002 film)|The Rookie]]''.\n\nHer live album [[Show (Allison Moorer album)|''Show'']] was recorded in one night at 12th and Porter in Nashville.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Allison Moorer \u2013 Show |url=https://www.nodepression.com/album-reviews/allison-moorer-show/ |access-date=February 19, 2023 |website=No Depression |language=en-US}}</ref> It features the first recorded collaboration between Moorer and Lynne. After releasing ''Show'' and a DVD on Universal South, Moorer moved to independent label [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]]. With a slightly rougher edge than past efforts, ''[[The Duel (Allison Moorer album)|The Duel]]'' was released in April 2004. Moorer's first husband, Doyle Lee Primm, was featured as a songwriter on her first four albums. They divorced in 2005. After serving as his opening act on a European tour, Moorer married fellow singer/songwriter [[Steve Earle]]. Earle produced her 2006 album, ''[[Getting Somewhere]]''. Moorer wrote all the songs, with the exception of one co-written with Earle. They were both nominated for the Best Country Collaboration with Vocals Grammy, for the song \"Days Aren't Long Enough\" from Earle's ''Washington Square Serenade'' in 2008. The song was also nominated for an [[Americana Music Association]] award. Moorer gave birth to the couple's first child, John Henry Earle, on April 5, 2010,<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 6, 2011 |title=Steve Earle: Hardcore Troubador Page 3 |url=https://www.stereophile.com/content/steve-earle-hardcore-troubador-page-3 |access-date=February 19, 2023 |website=Stereophile.com |language=en}}</ref> but they separated in 2012 and divorced in 2015.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hattenstone |first=Simon |date=June 14, 2017 |title=Steve Earle: 'My wife left me for a younger, skinnier, less talented singer' |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/14/steve-earle-so-you-wanna-be-an-outlaw-interview |access-date=February 19, 2023 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\nMoorer released the [[Buddy Miller]]-produced ''Mockingbird'' in February 2008;[4] an album mainly of covers of songs by female singer/songwriters including her sister, Shelby Lynne.\n[[File:Allison Moorer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Moorer performing in 2009]]\nIn 2009, Moorer performed in ''[[The People Speak]]'', a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian [[Howard Zinn]]'s ''A People's History of the United States''.[5] She appeared in the off-Broadway ''Rebel Voices'', a dramatization of Howard Zinn and Anthony Arnove's ''Voices of a People's History of the United States'' in late 2007. Also, in 2009, she appeared on the [[BBC]] series ''[[Transatlantic Sessions]]'', Series 4, Episodes 4 and 5, performing a version of the Irish folk song, \"Carrickfergus\". She toured with the [[Jerry Douglas]] and Ally Bain led Transatlantic Sessions band in early 2011.\n\nIn 2015, Moorer released her ninth album, ''Down to Believing'', which marked a return to collaborating with [[Kenny Greenberg]].\n\nIn August 2017, Moorer released her tenth album, ''Not Dark Yet'', in collaboration with her sister. Produced by British folk singer [[Teddy Thompson]], it featured covers of songs by [[Merle Haggard]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[The Killers]] as well as one original song written by Moorer and Lynne, \"Is It Too Much.\" During an extended interview at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]], the duo revealed that they were planning a second collaborative album which would instead feature all original material and that they were to begin writing together for the new project in 2018.\n\nMoorer co-produced the 2019 [[Hayes Carll]] record ''[[What It Is (Hayes Carll album)|What It Is]]''.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Gage |first=Jeff |date=February 26, 2019 |title=Hayes Carll on Harnessing Humor, Dance-Hall Vibe of New Album 'What It Is' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/hayes-carll-times-like-these-video-800244/ |access-date=February 19, 2023 |magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> She and Carll were married on May 12, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 14, 2019 |title=Hayes Carll and Allison Moorer Get Married |url=https://www.thecountrydaily.com/2019/05/14/hayes-carll-and-allison-moorer-get-married/ |access-date=February 19, 2023 |website=The Country Daily}}</ref> Moorer's album ''Blood'' was to be released October 25, 2019; her book, ''Blood: A Memoir'', was scheduled for publication on October 29, 2019, on [[Da Capo Press]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/allison-moorer-new-album-memoir-blood-the-rock-and-the-hill-873608/|title=Allison Moorer Previews New Album and Memoir With Visceral Song 'The Rock and the Hill'|first1=Stephen L.|last1=Betts|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=August 19, 2019}}</ref> \n\nIn May 2024, Moorer announced that she had taken a job as a writer-editor at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Willman |first1=Chris|title=Allison Moorer on Setting Performing Aside to Take a Job With the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum: 'It's a Way to Give Back to What Saved Me'|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 10, 2024 |url=https://variety.com/2024/music/news/allison-moorer-country-music-hall-fame-museum-1235998654/|access-date=11 May 2024}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

According to the founders, they had no original interest in starting a band. Instead, they wanted to promote a CD with traditional material they had recorded, and put together a small temporary lineup to play a few shows. After the initial performances went well, the group decided to stay together.<ref name=\"biouncleearl\"/> Until the end of 2003 the line-up of the band had changed several times. Amongst the members in this period where Tahmineh Gueramy (fiddle, vocals), Amanda Kowalski (bass, vocals), Casey Henry (banjo, vocals) and Sally Truitt (bass, vocals).<ref name=\"webarchive\"/>\n\nGroves mentioned in an interview how the band got its name, \"We just thought it would be a funny name for an all-women's group,\" she says. \"But we are fans of [[Earl Scruggs]], [[Steve Earle]], and [[Uncle Tupelo]]. It did come up in our discussion that there's some important Earls in this business.

The 2003 lineup consisted of KC Groves on [[mandolin]] and [[guitar]], [[Abigail Washburn]] on [[banjo]], [[Rayna Gellert]] on [[fiddle]] and [[Kristin Andreassen]], [[guitarist]], [[fiddler]], and [[clogging]].  There was no permanent [[bassist|bass player]].<ref name=\"blogsa\"/>\n\nIn 2004, the group released their first EP, titled ''Going to the Western Slope.''

She is known for her stripped-down songwriting style in the [[folk music]] genre. Her songs have been covered by numerous musicians, including [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Ellis Paul]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], [[Rory Block]], [[Dave Hause]], [[Sugarland]], [[Bette Midler]] and [[The Chicks]].\n\nIn 2007, Griffin received the Artist of the Year award from the [[Americana Music Association]], and her album ''[[Children Running Through]]'' won the award for Best Album. She received the Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting at the [[2023 Americana Music Honors & Awards]]. In 2011, Griffin's album ''[[Downtown Church]]'' won the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Gospel Album]] and her 2019 [[Patty Griffin (album)|self-titled album]] won the [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album]].\n\n==Biography==\nGriffin is from [[Old Town, Maine]], United States, next to the [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]] [[Native American reservation]]. The youngest child in her family, with six older siblings, she bought a guitar for $50 at age 16. She sang and played but had no inclination to become a professional musician. After a 6-year marriage, which ended in 1994, Griffin began playing in Boston coffee houses and was \"scouted\" by [[A&M Records]], which signed her on the strength of her demo tape. When the finished studio recordings were submitted to A&M, the company executives thought it was overproduced, so producer [[Nile Rodgers]] and A&M instead released a stripped-down reworking of her demo tape as the album ''[[Living with Ghosts]].''<ref name=\"Harris\">Harris, Craig (accessed March 17, 2008) [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=patty griffin|bio=true}} Billboard com]</ref>\n\nGriffin's second album, ''[[Flaming Red]]'', released in 1998, was a departure from the [[acoustic music|acoustic]] sound of ''Living with Ghosts'', with a mix of mellow songs and high-tempo [[rock and roll]] songs. The title track, \"Flaming Red\", is an example of the latter, beginning with an even beat until it increases to a fevered pitch of emotion. Another song from the album, \"Tony\", is also featured on the charity benefit album ''[[Live in the X Lounge]]''.\n\nHer third album, ''[[Silver Bell (album)|Silver Bell]]'', has a sound similar to its predecessor. It was released by A&M in 2013, 13 years after it was recorded (and well after bootlegged copies had been circulated). A&M dropped Griffin's contract after ''Silver Bell'' was recorded, and she was then signed by [[Dave Matthews]]' [[ATO Records]]. Griffin re-recorded songs from that album for later releases, such as \"Making Pies\", \"Mother of God\", \"Standing\", and \"[[Top of the World (Dixie Chicks song)|Top of the World]]\". Copies of the unreleased ''Silver Bell'' were leaked and bootlegged and can be easily acquired by the B&P ([[blanks and postage]]) method on [[message boards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pattynet.net/forum/|title=PattyNet \u2022 Index page|website=Pattynet.net|access-date=March 9, 2019|archive-date=January 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105172653/http://pattynet.net/forum/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In August 2013, it was announced that [[Universal Music Enterprises|UM<sup>e</sup>]] planned to release ''Silver Bell'', mixed by producer [[Glyn Johns]], in October 2013.<ref name=\"Billboard 20130731\">{{cite magazine|last=Votaw|first=Emily|title=Patty Griffin's Lost 'Silver Bell' Album to Be Released in October|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 31, 2013|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/5327862/patty-griffins-lost-silver-bell-album-to-be-released-in-october|access-date=August 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nFour albums followed on ATO: ''[[1000 Kisses (album)|1000 Kisses]]'' (2002), ''[[A Kiss in Time]]'' (2003), ''[[Impossible Dream (Patty Griffin album)|Impossible Dream]]'' (2004), and ''[[Children Running Through]]'' (2007).\n\nIn 2004, Griffin toured with Emmylou Harris, [[Buddy Miller]], [[Gillian Welch]] and [[David Rawlings]] as the [[Sweet Harmony Traveling Revue]].

Her father worked the night shift at a sawmill as part of the area's logging industry. Her great-grandfather, from [[Cornwall]], southwest of England, was an underground coal miner in the region. Her grandmother's family had headed there in a covered wagon on the Oregon Trail, from Virginia.\n\nHosking says old-time music was strong in her mountain area, as well as country. She grew up hearing neighbors play their simple instruments by ear, as a group called the Mountaineers. And the school cook took several girls from the school, taught them songs and they performed as the Farmerettes; with the Farmerettes, Hosking played washboard and sang her first solo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/yb/146046838 |title=Article by Patrick S.

Boy, was I wrong! This might be her most rockin' album to date. The album starts like a house afire: Carlile totally nails the vocal on the gospel influenced \"Wherever Is Your Heart\", and this one makes you realize just how good she is. When she sings, you're a believer. She'll have you singing along on the infectious \"The Thing I Regret\". Maybe the biggest surprise on the album is \"Mainstream Kid\", which shows some grit! It's as badass as Carlile has ever sounded. If you had Brandi Carlile pegged as an adult-contemporary softie, you might try again. Brandi Carlile and the Hanseroth twins show that they aren't afraid to rock out.

Music was an important part of the Moorer family. Her father was a local bandleader and her mother a harmony-singing teacher; as children, she and her younger sister [[Allison Moorer|Allison]] \u2014 later a country recording artist in her own right \u2014 sometimes joined their parents on-stage to sing along. However, Lynne's father was a violent alcoholic who abused his wife. In 1985, her mother fled with the two girls to Mobile. Her father soon discovered their whereabouts. In 1986, when Lynne was 17 and her sister was 14, he fatally shot her mother in the family's driveway. He then turned the gun on himself while his daughters were in the house.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/15/132082946/shelby-lynne-and-allison-moorer-musical-sisters | title=Shelby Lynne and Allison Moorer: Musical Sisters | publisher=NPR | date=December 15, 2010 | access-date=April 4, 2018 | archive-date=September 20, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920182902/http://www.npr.org/2010/12/15/132082946/shelby-lynne-and-allison-moorer-musical-sisters | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Early years===\nLynne appeared on [[The Nashville Network|TNN]]'s country music show ''[[Nashville Now]]'' in 1987. She soon landed a recording contract with [[Epic Records]]. Her first recording for Epic was a duet with [[George Jones]], \"If I Could Bottle This Up\", which became a top-50 hit in 1988.  Epic teamed Lynne with producer [[Billy Sherrill]] for her 1989 debut album ''[[Sunrise (Shelby Lynne album)|Sunrise]]''. The follow-up, 1990's ''[[Tough All Over (Shelby Lynne album)|Tough All Over]]'', took more of a mainstream country direction, and 1991's ''[[Soft Talk]]'' found Lynne moving into slick [[country pop]].\n\nLynne placed several songs on the country charts during this period, but none managed to break into the top 20. Critics generally regarded her as a promising talent, and she won the [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Female Artist of the Year|Academy of Country Music Award for Top New Female Vocalist]] in 1991, beating the other two nominees [[Carlene Carter]] and [[Matraca Berg]].\n\nHowever, she was tiring of the lack of control she was afforded over her image and musical direction. She split from Epic and signed with the smaller [[Morgan Creek Productions|Morgan Creek]] label, debuting with 1993's ''[[Temptation (Shelby Lynne album)|Temptation]]'', an exercise in [[Bob Wills]]-style [[Western swing]] and [[big band]] jazz. The label folded not long after, and she moved on to [[Magnatone]] for 1995's ''[[Restless (Shelby Lynne album)|Restless]]'', which marked a return to contemporary-style country.

The statement offended their core fan base who thought it rude and unpatriotic, and the ensuing controversy cost the group half of their concert audience attendance in the United States and led to accusations of the three women being un-American, as well as hate mail, death threats, and the public destruction of their albums in protest.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.today.com/popculture/dixie-chicks-shut-sing-toronto-wbna14822593 |title=Dixie Chicks 'Shut Up and Sing' in Toronto |date=September 13, 2006 | publisher=Today.com |access-date=October 8, 2006}}</ref>  The group followed a small hiatus with a live album and a documentary highlighting the maelstrom  created by Maines' comment entitled ''[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]]''.

Although most strongly identified with the [[Americana (music)|Americana]] music tradition, his music also incorporates elements of [[Folk music|folk]], [[Rock music|rock]], and the [[Western music (North America)|cowboy music]] of the [[Western United States|American West]].  Many of his songs have been recorded by other artists, including [[Johnny Cash]], [[The Texas Tornados]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Guy Clark]], [[Joe Ely]], [[The Sir Douglas Quintet]], [[Jason Boland & The Stragglers|Jason Boland]], [[Nanci Griffith]], [[Katy Moffatt]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], [[Sailcat]], [[Iris Dement]], [[Dave Alvin]], and [[Suzy Bogguss]].\n\nIn addition to his music, Russell is also a painter and author.  He has published a book of songwriting quotes (co-edited with [[Sylvia Tyson]]), a detective novel (in [[Scandinavia]]), a book of letters with [[Charles Bukowski]],  and two books from Bangtail Press: ''120 Songs of Tom Russell'', and ''Blue Horse/Red Desert - The Art of Tom Russell''.\n\nIn 2016 a new book of Tom Russell essays was published: ''Ceremonies of the Horsemen''.  The essays, originally published in ''Ranch & Reata'' magazine, are centered on the [[Western United States|American West]] and include an essay on Johnny Cash for which Russell won a 2015 [[ASCAP]] AWARD for [[music journalism]].\n\nFrontera, Russell's recording label, has published several books, including companion pieces to two recording projects, ''The Rose of Roscrae'' and ''Folk Hotel'' as well as an essay/art book, ''The Ballad of Western Expressionism'' and a novel, ''Against The Blood.''\n\n==Early life and career==\nRussell was born in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"Hamlin\">{{cite web | url = http://www.mysteryisland.net/tomrussell | title = Tom Russell interview | publisher = Mystery Island Publications | first = Bradley Mason | last = Hamlin | year = 2008 | quote = I was born down on Hope Street, downtown L.A., in the late 40s.}}</ref> He graduated from the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] with a master's degree in [[sociology of law]] and [[criminology]].<ref name=\"Hamlin\" /> In 1969, he spent a year teaching in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]], during the [[Biafran War]].<ref name=\"Hamlin\" /> He has also lived in [[Spain]] and [[Norway]] -- and played music at a circus in [[Puerto Rico]]. He began his musical career in the early 1970s in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], playing strip bars along [[Downtown Eastside|Skid Row]], then later relocated to [[Texas]] and formed a band with singer-pianist Patricia Hardin. In 1975, the duo won the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]] New Folk Singer-Songwriter Contest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kerrvillefolkfestival.org/history-of-newfolk|title = History of the Kerrville New Folk Songwriting Contest &#124; Kerrville Folk Festival}}</ref>\n\nIn 1977, the duo moved to [[San Francisco]], performing regularly in clubs there as Hardin & Russell, during which time they recorded the second of their two studio albums. They eventually split in 1979, at which point Russell drifted out of the music industry for a year. It was during this hiatus that Russell wrote his classic song \"Gallo Del Cielo\". Both Hardin & Russell albums (''Ring of Bone'' and ''Wax Museum'') received high critical acclaim, and the first was reviewed in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' by [[Chet Flippo]]. During this period Russell was also the winner of the first Woody Guthrie - William Oliver Award for songwriting, as well as the professional [[Country music|country]] category in the first American Song Festival.\n\nRussell moved to [[New York City]] in 1980 and while working as a taxi driver in [[Queens]], he met guitarist [[Andrew Hardin]] (no relation to Patricia). After hearing his songs, Hardin convinced him that they should form a new band. Shortly afterward, [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]] of the [[Grateful Dead]] was a passenger in Russell's cab; Russell sang Hunter his song \"Gallo Del Cielo\" and an impressed Hunter invited Russell to join him on stage at New York's [[The Bitter End|Bitter End]]. Hunter encouraged Russell to make a full-fledged return to the music business and Russell later opened for Hunter at the [[Lone Star Cafe]]. Hunter sang Russell's \"Gallo Del Cielo\" at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].\n\nAndrew Hardin remained Russell's full-time sideman until April, 2006.  \"Gallo del Cielo\" became one of Russell's most fabled songs and has been recorded by [[Ian Tyson]], [[Joe Ely]], Brian Burns, Jason Boland and the Stragglers, and Katie Lee. The song has been cited as a favorite by [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]] (as noted in [[Clarence Clemons]]' book ''Big Man''.)\n\n==Tom Russell Band==\nBetween 1984 and 1994, the Tom Russell Band, composed of Russell on acoustic guitar and vocals, Andrew Hardin (guitar), [[Fats Kaplin]] (pedal steel, fiddle, harmonica, button accordion), Billy Troiani (bass), Rich Crane, Charlie Caldarola, and Mike Warner (drums), released four albums on [[Philo Records (folk)|Philo Records]]. These albums blended elements of folk, country and rock music, and often featured songs inspired by the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]], blue-collar American life, and events from Russell's own life (for instance, the track \"Road to Bayamon\" draws on his experiences playing in a carnival in Puerto Rico). Russell's storytelling approach was also prominent in songs such as \"Haley's Comet\", which was also recorded by co-writer Dave Alvin and [[Doug Sahm]] and [[Texas Tornados|The Texas Tornados]]. \"Haley's Comet\" imaginatively recalls the last, tragic days in the life of [[rock and roll]] music legend [[Bill Haley (musician)|Bill Haley]]. These early Tom Russell albums are now considered pioneering recordings of the genre which would come to be known as [[Americana music|Americana]].\n\nRussell was next signed to [[HighTone Records]] in California. He released five albums for Hightone before the label was acquired by [[Shout! Factory|Shout! Factory Records]]. Russell's first album on the HighTone label, ''The Rose of the San Joaquin'', was produced by Dave Alvin and [[Greg Leisz]].\n\n==''The Man From God Knows Where''==\nIn the 1990s Russell released several critically acclaimed solo albums and also collaborated with [[blues]] singer [[Barrence Whitfield]] on two albums (''Hillbilly Voodoo'' and ''Cowboy Mambo'' - recently released as a double CD). Russell also recorded an acoustic album mixing new material with his favorite [[cowboy]]-themed songs. His albums include guest appearances from other folk, country, and Americana artists, such as [[Chris Gaffney (musician)|Chris Gaffney]] and Dave Alvin. Russell's song \"[[Outbound Plane]]\", co-written with [[Nanci Griffith]], became a top-ten country hit for [[Suzy Bogguss]]. However, his most significant album of the 1990s was the innovative 1999 folk opera, ''The Man From God Knows Where''.\n\nDrawing on the music of [[Norway]] and [[Ireland]] in addition to American folk and country, ''The Man From God Knows Where'' is a [[song cycle]] tracing the journeys of Russell's ancestors from Europe to America and the struggles they encountered. Recorded in Norway near the spot where his great-grandfather was born in 1847, the album features singers [[Iris DeMent]], [[Dolores Keane]], [[Dave Van Ronk]], and [[Kari Bremnes]], portraying (and telling the stories of) Russell's various ancestors. The album's title came from the epitaph of a different [[Thomas Russell (rebel)|Tom Russell]], an Irish activist executed in 1803.\n\n==Recent work==\nRussell's albums in the 21st century have been heavily influenced by the art, culture, history and folklore of the American Southwest. Albums such as ''Borderland'' resonate with a strong and authentic [[Tejano music|Tex-Mex]] influence, reflecting life on both sides of the border.\n\nRussell's songs \"Tonight We Ride\" and \"Navajo Rug\" were chosen by members of the [[Western Writers of America]] as two of the top 100 Western songs of all time.<ref name=\"Top100\">{{Cite web|title=The Top 100 Western Songs|author=Western Writers of America|year=2010|authorlink=Western Writers of America|publisher=American Cowboy|url=http://www.americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019002745/http://americancowboy.com/culture/top-100-western-songs|archivedate=19 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2005 Russell released ''Hotwalker'', the second part of his Americana trilogy (the first part being ''The Man From God Knows Where''). It was another conceptual work largely inspired by his correspondence with author Charles Bukowski. Subtitled ''A Ballad for Gone America'', the album features songs and spoken word pieces, many of the latter delivered by another friend of Bukowski, circus midget Little Jack Horton. The sampled voices of [[Lenny Bruce]] and [[Edward Abbey]] are also heard on the album, which takes the form of a musical collage lamenting the passing of the America of Russell's childhood and the [[Beat Generation]]. [[Jack Kerouac]], Charles Bukowski, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, [[Harry Partch]], and [[Dave Van Ronk]] also appear on the record.\n\nRussell made five nationally televised appearances on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', as well as playing a show for Letterman in Montana.\n\nIn 2006, Russell released ''Love and Fear'', a collection of original songs that were inspired by the highs and lows of his own relationships.  This was followed in 2007 by ''Wounded Heart of America'', a tribute album of Tom Russell songs covered by other artists, including Johnny Cash, Doug Sahm, Joe Ely, Suzy Bogguss, Dave Alvin, [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and beat poet laureate [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]]. Two new songs, \"Who's Gonna Build Your Wall?\" and \"The Death of Jimmy Martin\", are also included on the album.\n\nIn 2008, Russell's new record company, Shout! Factory, released a 2-CD retrospective album entitled ''Veteran's Day: Anthology''.  Russell and legendary Canadian singer/songwriter [[Ian Tyson]] held court at Elko, Nevada's [[National Cowboy Poetry Gathering]], producing ''Mano a Mano'', a DVD on the art of songwriting.\n\nIn 2009, Shout! Factory released Russell's album ''Blood and Candle Smoke'', featuring twelve original songs. The album was recorded at WaveLab Recording Studio in [[Tucson]], [[Arizona]] with members of [[Calexico (band)|Calexico]] providing a [[world music]] beat to many of the songs.  The album was produced by Tom Russell and [[Craig Schumacher]], who has worked with [[Neko Case]], [[Iron & Wine]] and Calexico. 2011 saw Russell release both a new album, ''Mesabi'', and a documentary DVD, ''Don't Look Down''.\n\nIn 2013, Frontera Records released ''Aztec Jazz'', a concert recording made with the Norwegian Wind Ensemble (the oldest working orchestra in the world). With the ensemble, Russell was able to realize the vision of reframing some of his more recent songs. He also released ''Museum of Memories Vol. 2 (1973\u20132013)'', a collection of demos, outtakes and previously unreleased live recordings covering a forty-year span.\n\n2014 saw the release of several new projects, including two on Frontera Records: ''Midway To Bayamon'', a compilation of two mid-80s cassette-only releases plus bonus tracks, and ''Tonight We Ride'', an anthology of cowboy songs, including some previously unreleased tracks. The Rockbeat label issued a 2-CD set, ''The Western Years'', collecting western-themed songs primarily from Russell's years on the HighTone label. Rockbeat also re-issued the acclaimed Americana classic ''Tulare Dust: A Songwriters' Tribute To Merle Haggard'' which Russell co-produced with Dave Alvin, including a bonus disc taken from a live concert given by many of the artists involved with the project.\n\nIn April 2015 Russell released ''[[The Rose of Roscrae]]'', a double-album on Frontera Records, a Western folk opera that completes the trilogy begun with ''The Man From God Knows Where'' and ''Hotwalker''. The double album depicts the journey of an Irishman named Johnny Dutton who sails to America to become a cowboy. There are 52 tracks interspersed with historic and contemporary voices that include: Johnny Cash, [[Walt Whitman]], [[John Trudell]], [[Lead Belly]], Joe Ely, [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]], [[Tex Ritter]], [[Eliza Gilkyson]], [[Augie Meyers]], [[Finbar Furey]], [[Maura O'Connell]], [[Jimmy LaFave]], [[A.L. Lloyd]], Glen Orhlin, Sourdough Slim, [[David Olney]] and others, as well as an overture by Mats Halling and The Norwegian Wind Ensemble. ''The Rose of Roscrae'' was hailed as the top folk album of 2015 in many publications, including [[The Irish Times]], [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo Magazine]], [[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut Magazine]], and [[The Los Angeles Times]].\n\nIn 2016 Frontera Records released the second Tom Russell Anthology: ''Gunpowder Sunsets'', including favorites from recent albums along with previously unreleased material.\n\nRussell released two projects in 2017, \"Play One More: The Songs of Ian & Sylvia\" through True North Records, and the Frontera Records release of new original songs, \"Folk Hotel,\" which was well received.\n\nTo replace the out-of-print \"Veteran's Day\" anthology, Russell returned to the studio with former guitarist Andrew Hardin to re-record his best known songs in an acoustic format called \"Old Songs Yet To Sing.\"\n\nIn 2019, Russell released an album of new compositions, \"October in the Railroad Earth,\" featuring Bill Kirchen on guitar and Eliza Gilkyson guesting on harmony vocals on two tracks.

One could assume that I\u2019m straight, but I am not and especially in this time of increased polarization and bigotry, it is really important that people understand that nothing is black and white. Nothing is simple and you can\u2019t assume that because I am married to a man and I have a child that I am a straight person. You can\u2019t say homophobic things to me and have it pass. Part of me wanted to really acknowledge that publicly\".

His father wanted to be a pro athlete and was courted by the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], but instead, he got a job in Fort Worth with the [[Tandy Corporation]]. Burnett was brought up in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] of his mother. He forgot the origin of his nickname, which he uses without a dash.\n\nBurnett learned golf at an early age. When he was seven years old, he played at the [[Texas Christian University]] course. He idolized golf pro [[Ben Hogan]], who was from Fort Worth. Burnett and the other boys occasionally watched him practice at the [[driving range]]. Burnett was on the golf team at [[Paschal High School]]. In 2014 he participated in the [[AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am|professional tournament at Pebble Beach]].<ref name=\"sachs\">{{cite book|last1=Sachs|first1=Lloyd|title=T Bone Burnett: A Life in Pursuit|date=October 4, 2016|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-1477303771|pages=9\u201312}}</ref>\n\n==Burnett's musical roots==\nBurnett discovered music through his parents' 78 RPM [[phonograph records]] of [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Count Basie]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Dinah Washington]], and the songs of [[Cole Porter]]. He was drawn to music that took him to unconventional places, and he felt no compulsion to stick to one genre. He heard [[Peggy Lee]], [[Hank Williams]], and [[the Beatles]] on the radio, was influenced by [[Buddy Holly]], and revered [[Johnny Cash]]. He was smitten by the music of [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[Skip James]], [[the Stanley Brothers]], and [[Jimmy Reed]].<ref name=\"sachs\"/>\n\nHe also learned about music through his friend, [[Stephen Bruton]]. Bruton's father was a jazz drummer who owned a music store on the [[Texas Christian University]] campus, where the boys spent many weekends. Bruton, a [[banjo]]ist, revealed his interest in [[bluegrass music]] and [[field recording]]s from the 1920s and 1930s. Burnett was enamored with the live version of the song \"Wrought Iron Rag\" by the [[Dixieland]] revival band [[Wilbur de Paris]] and His New New Orleans Jazz. The boys would sneak into clubs to hear bands.<ref name=\"sachs\"/>{{rp|12}}\n\nAt around the same age, Burnett picked up the guitar. Overwhelmed by seeing the Beatles on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', he started [[garage band]]s with Bruton. After graduating from high school in 1965, they spent most of their time at Sound City, a recording studio in the basement of a radio station where Burnett became fascinated by recording. Forming the band The Loose Ends and adopting the stage name Jon T. Bone, Burnett wrote and recorded a 1966 single \"Free Soul\"/\"He's A Nobody\".  The b-side briefly charted on local Fort Worth radio station KFJZ, and the single was picked up for national distribution by [[Mala Records]], though it made no national chart listings.  A second Loose Ends single (\"Dead End Kid\"/\"Verses\") appeared on [[Bell Records]] in 1967, but didn't chart regionally or nationally. This 1967 single was written and co-produced by Burnett (still using the alias \"Jon T. Bone\"), and was his first production credit.\n\nBurnett's parents had divorced when he was in high school, and his father, with whom he was living, died in 1967. He attended Texas Christian University briefly, then dropped out to work as an [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) agent.<ref name=\"sachs\"/>{{rp|13\u201315}}\n\n==Pursuing music==\nBurnett (as J.

''Truth Decay'' was a [[roots rock]] album described by the ''[[Rolling Stone Record Guide]]'' as \"mystic Christian blues\". In 1982, his ''Trap Door'' EP (also produced by Reggie Fisher), released on [[Warner Bros. Records]], yielded the song \"I Wish You Could Have Seen Her Dance\". Burnett toured after the release of ''Trap Door'', opening several dates for [[The Who]], leading a band that featured [[Mick Ronson]] on guitar. His 1983 album ''[[Proof Through the Night]]'',<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> whose song \"When the Night Falls\" got some FM airplay, and his 1987 album ''[[The Talking Animals]]'' were more in the vein of 1980s [[new wave music]], while his self-titled 1986 album was an album of acoustic [[country music]]. His 1992 album ''[[The Criminal Under My Own Hat]]'' tended toward [[adult album alternative]] music.\n\n''Proof Through the Night'' was reissued by Rhino Records' Handmade Music in a limited edition of 5,000 on May 29, 2007, in an expanded version.
