The band was also known as '''Bill Haley and the Comets''' and '''Bill Haley's Comets'''. From late 1954 to late 1956, the group recorded nine Top 20 singles, one of which was number one and three that were Top Ten. The single \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" was the best-selling rock single in the history of the genre and maintained that position for several years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bogdanov|first1=Vladimir|last2=Woodstra|first2=Chris|last3=Erlewine|first3=Stephen Tomas|date=2003|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music|location=|publisher=Backbeat Books|page=315|isbn=0-87930-760-9}}</ref>\n\nBand leader [[Bill Haley]] had previously been a [[Western swing]] performer; after recording a [[rockabilly]] version of [[Ike Turner]] and his [[Kings of Rhythm]]'s \"[[Rocket 88]]\", one of the first rock and roll recordings, Haley changed his band's musical direction to rock music. They went on to record hit versions of \"[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]\", \"[[Shake, Rattle & Roll]]\", the aforementioned \"Rock Around the Clock\", \"Dim, Dim the Lights\", \"[[Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie]]\", \"Razzle-Dazzle\", \"[[See You Later, Alligator]]\", \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In|The Saints Rock 'N' Roll]]\" and \"[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]\". In 1956, the group appeared in two early rock and roll movies with disc jockey [[Alan Freed]]: ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]''.\n\nThough the group was considered to be at the forefront of rock and roll during the genre's formative years, the arrival of more risqu\u00e9 acts such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Little Richard]] by 1956 led the more clean-cut Haley and his Comets to decline in popularity. Haley would remain popular in [[Europe]] and go on to have a comeback as a nostalgia act in the 1970s, along with many of his contemporaries. Following Haley's death, no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the Comets name, all claiming (with varying degrees of authority) to be the continuation of Haley's group. As of the end of 2014, four such groups were still performing in the United States and internationally.\n\n==Early history==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Comets Ed Sullivan 1955.jpg|thumb|Bill Haley and the Comets on the Ed Sullivan Show or Toast of the Town, Sunday, August 7, 1955, CBS, Hartford, Connecticut]] -->\nIn around the mid-1940s, Bill Haley performed with the Down Homers and formed a group called the Four Aces of Western Swing. The group that later became the Comets initially formed as \"Bill Haley and the Saddlemen\" {{Circa|1949}}\u20131952, and performed mostly country and western songs, though occasionally with a bluesy feel. The group was also the first to record a cover version (in July 1951) of [[Rocket 88]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.edsullivan.com/artists/bill-haley-his-comets/|title=Artists, Bill Haley & His Comets|date=June 14, 2015|work=Ed Sullivan|access-date=November 10, 2023|quote=}}</ref> originally a [[jump blues]] song by [[Jackie Brenston]] and his Delta Cats, who were actually [[Ike Turner]] and his [[Kings of Rhythm]]. He did so for the [[Philadelphia]]-based [[Holiday Records]] label, in what is now recognized as a [[rockabilly]] style. It sold well and was followed in 1952 by a cover of a 1940s [[rhythm and blues]] song called \"[[Rock the Joint]]\" for Holiday's sister company, [[Essex Records]].\n\nDuring those years however, Haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in America. Many Saddlemen recordings were not released until the 1970s and 1980s, and highlights included romantic ballads such as \"Rose of My Heart\" and [[western swing]] tunes such as \"Yodel Your Blues Away.\" The original members of this group were Haley, pianist and accordion player [[Johnny Grande]] and [[steel guitar]]ist [[Billy Williamson (guitarist)|Billy Williamson]]. Al Thompson was the group's first bass player, followed by [[Al Rex]] and [[Marshall Lytle]]. During the group's early years, it recorded under several other names, including Johnny Clifton and His String Band and [[Reno Browne]] and Her Buckaroos (although Browne, a female matinee idol of the time, did not actually appear on the record).\n\n\"Rocket 88\", \"Rock the Joint\", and their immediate follow-ups were released under the increasingly incongruous Saddlemen name. It soon became apparent that a new name for the group was needed to fit the new musical style. A friend of Haley's, making note of the common mispronunciation of the name [[Halley's Comet]] to rhyme with ''Bailey'', suggested that Haley call his band the Comets. This event is cited in the Haley biographies ''Sound and Glory'' by John Haley and John von Hoelle; ''Bill Haley'' by John Swenson; and in ''Still Rockin' Around the Clock'', a memoir by Comets bass player Marshall Lytle.\n\nThe new name for the group was adopted in the fall of 1952, before the 1953 release of \"[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]\" which had some elements of [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]] music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/2135591-Bill-Haley-With-Haleys-Comets-Crazy-Man-Crazy|title=Bill Haley With Haley's Comets* \u2013 Crazy Man, Crazy|date=July 6, 2017|work=Discogs|access-date=November 10, 2023|quote=}}</ref> Members of the group at that time were Haley, Johnny Grande, Billy Williamson and Marshall Lytle. Grande usually played piano on records but switched to accordion for live shows as it was more portable than a piano and easier to deal with during musical numbers that involved a lot of dancing around. Soon after renaming the band Haley hired his first drummer, Earl Famous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/jodimars1.html|title=RAB Hall of Fame: The Jodimars|website=Rockabillyhall.com|access-date=May 1, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215123/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Jodimars1.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016}}</ref> Displeased with the lineup, Haley sought out Dick Boccelli (also known as Dick Richards), who turned down the job but recommended a young drummer Charlie Higler. Soon after, Haley asked Richards again, who then accepted the role. During this time (and as late as the fall of 1955), Haley did not have a permanent lead guitar player, choosing to use session musicians on records and either playing lead guitar himself or having Williamson play steel solos.\n\nEven before the release of more successful records, the group had achieved greatness in some respects: \"No one had blended country and R&B on a single before the Comets' \"Rock the Joint\". No one had scored an American Top 20 hit with anything that could really qualify as rock'n'roll before their single \"Crazy Man Crazy\" in 1953\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/22/bill-haley-rock-around-the-clock-worlds-first-rock-anthem|title=Bill Haley: Rock Around the Clock \u2013 the world's first rock anthem|date=May 22, 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==National success and \"Rock Around the Clock\"==\n[[File:BillHaleyHankSnowTicket.jpg|thumb|Bill Haley/Elvis/Hank Snow Ticket \u2013 Oklahoma City newspaper ad. for Sunday October 16, 1955; two shows at the Municipal Auditorium.

It did not attain the Number 1 position on the American charts, but it became Haley's first gold record. [[Elvis Presley]] recorded the song in 1956, combining Haley's arrangement with Turner's original lyrics, but his version was not a substantial hit. Late in 1954, Haley recorded another hit, \"Dim, Dim The Lights\", which was one of the first R&B songs recorded by a white group to cross over to the R&B charts. [[Johnnie Ray]] had reached Number 1 with \"[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]\" in 1952.\n\nThe belated success of \"Rock Around the Clock\" is attributed to its use in the soundtrack of the film ''[[Blackboard Jungle]],''<ref name=pc5>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19751/m1/ |title=Show 5 \u2013 Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll: The Rock Revolution Gets Underway.

Their music and their act were part of a tradition in [[jazz]] and [[rhythm and blues]], but it all came like a thunderclap to most of their audience. In late 1954, Haley and His Comets appeared in a [[short subject]] entitled ''Round Up of Rhythm'', performing three songs. This was the earliest known theatrical rock and roll film release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217775/|title=Round Up of Rhythm (1954) - IMDb|access-date=November 24, 2020|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BillHaley.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Bill Haley & His Comets in 1954. Left to right: Joey D'Ambrosio, Dick Richards, Bill Haley]]\nIn 1955, Lytle, Richards and Ambrose quit the Comets in a salary dispute and formed their own group, the [[The Jodimars|Jodimars]]. Haley hired several new musicians to take their place: [[Rudy Pompilli]] on sax, Al Rex (a former member of the Saddlemen) on double bass, and Ralph Jones on drums. In addition, lead guitarist [[Franny Beecher]], who had been a session musician for Haley since [[Danny Cedrone]]'s death in the spring of 1954, became a full-time Comet and Haley's first performing lead guitarist (Cedrone had played the guitar solo on the original recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" and died shortly after the recording session for \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" in the summer of 1954). This version of the band became more popular than the earlier manifestation and appeared in several [[motion pictures]] over the next few years.\n\nOther hits recorded by the band included \"[[See You Later, Alligator]]\"<ref name=pc5/> in which Haley's frantic delivery contrasted with the [[Louisiana]] languor of the original by [[Bobby Charles]], \"Don't Knock the Rock\", \"Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie\", \"Rudy's Rock\" (the first instrumental hit of the rock and roll era), and \"Skinny Minnie.\"\n\nBill Haley and the Comets performed \"Rock Around the Clock\" in an a cappella and a lip-synched version on the [[NBC]] television program ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' hosted by [[Milton Berle]] on May 31, 1955. Berle predicted that the song would go to Number 1, calling the band \"A group of entertainers who are going right to the top.\" Berle also sang and danced to the song, which was performed by the entire cast of the show. This was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre a much wider audience.\n\nBill Haley and the Comets were the first rock and roll performers to appear on the [[CBS]] television musical variety program ''The [[Ed Sullivan Show]], or Toast of the Town'' on Sunday, August 7, 1955, in a broadcast from the Shakespeare Festival Theater in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. They performed a live version of \"Rock Around the Clock\" featuring Franny Beecher on lead guitar and Dick Richards on drums. The group made a second and final appearance on the ''Ed Sullivan Show'' on Sunday, April 28, 1957, performing \"[[Rudy's Rock]]\" and \"Forty Cups of Coffee.\"\n\nBill Haley and the Comets appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television twice in 1957, on the prime-time show on October 28 and on the regular daytime show on November 27. The band also appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' (also known as ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]''), a prime-time TV series from New York on March 22, 1958, during the first season (performing \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Ooh, Look-a There, Ain't She Pretty\") and on February 20, 1960 (performing \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Tamiami\").\n\nIn 1956, the group appeared in two of the earliest full-length rock and roll movies with [[Alan Freed]]: ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]].'' The [[The Platters|Platters]] were co-stars in the first movie, and [[Little Richard]] appeared in the second. ''Rock Around the Clock'' was produced by Sam Katzman (who would produce several Elvis Presley films in the 1960s) and directed by Fred F. Sears.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=1403164%7C184955&name=Rock-Around-the-Clock|title=&#124;Rock Around the Clock |website=Tcm.com|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Decline in popularity==\nThe band's popularity in the United States began to wane in 1956\u201357 as sexier, wilder acts such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Little Richard]] began to dominate the record charts (although Haley's cover version of Little Richard's \"[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]\", released in direct competition with Little Richard's original recording, outsold the original). After \"Skinny Minnie\" hit the charts in 1958, Haley had little further success in the United States, although a spin-off group made up of Comets musicians dubbed '''The Kingsmen''' (no relation to the later group of \"[[Louie, Louie]]\" fame) had a hit with an instrumental, \"Weekend\", that same year.\n\nOverseas, however, Haley and his band continued to be popular, touring the United Kingdom in February 1957, when Haley and his crew were mobbed by thousands of fans at [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] in London at an incident which the media dubbed the \"Second [[Battle of Waterloo]]\". The group also toured Australia in 1957, and in 1958 enjoyed a successful (if riot-dominated) tour of the European mainland. Bill Haley & His Comets were the first major American rock and roll act to tour the world in this way. Elvis, who was [[Elvis Presley's Army career|on military duty]] in Germany, visited them backstage at some shows. On a free day in Berlin they performed two songs in the [[Caterina Valente]] movie ''Hier Bin ich Hier Bleib Ich (Here I Am Here I Stay)''.\n\nBack in the U.S., Haley attempted to start his own record label, Clymax, and establish his own stable of performers, notably [[Sally Starr (TV hostess)|Sally Starr]] (the hostess of a Philadelphia television children's program) and the [[Matys Brothers]]. Members of the Comets were commissioned to work as session musicians on many of these recordings, many of which were written or co-written by Haley and members of the Comets. The Clymax experiment only lasted about a year. In 1959, Haley's relationship with Decca collapsed; after a final set of instrumental-only recordings in the fall, Haley announced he was leaving Decca for the new [[Warner Bros. Records]] label, which released two more albums in 1960, which were moderately successful. In 1960 Franny Beecher and Rudi Pompilli left the Comets to start their own record label. Replacing Beecher was a 20-year-old guitarist, [[Johnny Kay]], from Chester, Pennsylvania. Beecher later returned briefly to play with the Comets, when his record label failed to take off, sharing guitar duties with Kay. Kay left the band in 1966 but returned in the early 1970s for an aborted world tour. He appeared in the Wembley show, which was filmed and released as the London Rock and Roll Show.\n\n==Mexico and the late 1960s==\nIn 1961\u20131962, '''Bill Haley y sus Cometas''' (as the band was known in Hispanic America) signed with the [[Orfe\u00f3n]] label of Mexico and scored an unexpected hit with \"Twist Espa\u00f1ol\", a Spanish-language recording based on the [[Twist (dance)|twist]] dance craze, which was sweeping America at the time. Haley followed up with \"Florida Twist\" (#3 MEX, according to Billboard Hits Of The World 04.21.62), which was for a time the biggest-selling single in Mexican history. Although [[Chubby Checker]] and [[Hank Ballard]] were credited with starting the twist craze in America, in Mexico and Latin America, Bill Haley and His Comets were proclaimed the Kings of the Twist. Thanks to the success of \"Twist Espa\u00f1ol\" and \"Florida Twist\", among others, the band had continued success in Mexico and Latin America over the next few years, selling many recordings of Spanish and Spanish-flavored material and simulated live performances ([[overdubbed]] audience over studio recordings) on the Orfeon label and its subsidiary, Dimsa. They hosted a television series, ''Orfeon a Go-Go'', and made [[cameo appearance]]s in several movies, lip-synching some of their old hits. Haley, who was fluent in Spanish, recorded a number of songs in the language, but most of the band's output during these years was instrumental recordings, many utilizing local session musicians playing trumpet. There was also some experimentation with Haley's style during this time; one single for Orfeon was a folk ballad, \"Jimmy Martinez\", which Haley recorded without the Comets.\n\nIn 1966, the Comets (without Bill Haley) cut an album for Orfeon as session musicians for Big Joe Turner, who had always been an idol to Haley; no joint performance of \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" was recorded, however. In a 1974 interview with [[BBC Radio]], Haley said Turner's career was in a slump at this time, so he used his then-considerable influence with Orfeon to get Turner a recording session. The Comets' association with Orfeon/Dimsa ended later that year.\n\nBy 1967, as related by Haley in an interview with radio host [[Red Robinson]] in that year, the group was \"a free agent\" without any recording contracts at all, although the band continued to perform regularly in North America and Europe. During this year, Haley\u2014without the Comets\u2014recorded a pair of demos in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]: a country-western song, \"[[Jealous Heart]]\", on which he was backed by a local [[mariachi]] band (similar in style to the earlier \"Jimmy Martinez\"), and a late-60s-style rocker, \"Rock on Baby\", backed by a group called Superfine Dandelion. Neither recording would be released for 30 years. In 1968, Haley and the Comets recorded a single for the [[United Artists]] label, a version of [[Tom T. Hall]]'s \"[[That's How I Got to Memphis]]\", but no long-term association with the label resulted. In order to revive his recording career, Haley turned to Europe.\n\n==Revival==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Little Richard Columbia 1956.jpg|left|thumb|Little Richard and Bill Haley on the set of the 1956 Columbia Pictures film ''Don't Knock the Rock''.]] -->\nBy the late 1960s, Haley and the Comets were considered an \"oldies\" act. The band's popularity never waned in Europe. The group signed a lucrative deal with [[Sonet Records]] of Sweden in 1968 and recorded in a new version of \"Rock Around the Clock\", which hit the European charts that year. The band recorded a mixture of live and studio albums for the label over the next decade.\n\nIn the United States in 1969, promoter Richard Nader launched a series of [[rock and roll revival]] concert tours featuring artists of the 1950s and 1960s. At one of the first of these shows, held at the [[Felt Forum]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, Haley received an eight-and-a-half-minute standing ovation following his performance, as Nader related in his recorded introduction to Haley's live album ''Bill Haley Scrapbook'', which was recorded a few weeks later at the [[The Bitter End|Bitter End]] club in New York.\n\nThe band appeared in several concert films in the early 1970s, including ''[[The London Rock and Roll Show]]'' (for which Haley's 1960\u201366 lead guitarist, John Kay, briefly rejoined the band) and ''[[Let the Good Times Roll (film)|Let the Good Times Roll]]''. After 1974, tax and management problems prevented Haley from performing in the United States, so he performed in Europe almost exclusively, though he also toured South America in 1975. The band was also kept busy in the studio, recording numerous albums for Sonet and other labels in the 1970s, several with a [[country music]] flavor. In 1974, Haley's original Decca recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" hit the American sales charts once again, thanks to its use in the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and for two years, on the television program ''[[Happy Days]]''.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Late career==\nIn February 1976, Haley's saxophone player and best friend, [[Rudy Pompilli]], died of [[cancer]] after a nearly 20-year career with the Comets. Haley continued to tour for the next year with a succession of new sax players, but his popularity was waning again, and his 1976 performance in London was critically lambasted in the music media, such as ''[[Melody Maker]]''. That year, the group also recorded an album, ''R-O-C-K'' at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] for Sonet Records. According to one source, \"he had conflicted feelings about fame, was extremely private, suffered chronic alcoholism, and troubled relationships\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFzMvgEACAAJ|title=Crazy Man, Crazy The Bill Haley Story|author=Bill Haley, Jr., Peter Benjaminson |page= |date=October 3, 2019 |publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=9781617137112|accessdate=November 10, 2023}}</ref> Having admitted to an alcohol problem in a 1974 radio interview for the [[BBC]],<ref name=FallingComet>{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/falling-comet/|title=Falling Comet|date=2011-06-01|website=Texas Monthly|language=en|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=bill+haley+%22alcoholism%22&pg=PP15|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|last=Bronson|first=Fred|date=2003|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2|language=en}}</ref> Haley continued to battle alcoholism into the 1970s. \nIn early 1977, Haley announced his retirement from performing and settled down at his home in Mexico. According to the John Swenson biography of Haley, the musician was quoted as saying that he and Pompilli had an agreement that if one died, the other would retire.\n\nThe Comets continued to tour on their own during this period.\n\nIn 1979, Haley was persuaded to return to performing with the offer of a lucrative contract to tour Europe. An almost completely new group of musicians, mostly British, including saxophonist [[Pete Thomas (saxophonist)|Pete Thomas]], were assembled to perform as the Comets. Haley appeared on numerous television shows and in the movie ''Blue Suede Shoes'', filmed at one of his London concerts in March 1979. A few days later, a performance in [[Birmingham]] was videotaped and aired on UK television; it was released on DVD in 2005. During the March tour, Haley recorded several tracks in London for his next album for Sonet, completing the work that summer in Muscle Shoals; the album, ''Everyone Can Rock & Roll'', issued later in 1979, was the last release of new recordings by Haley before his death.\n\nOn November 26, 1979, Haley and the Comets performed for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalvarietycharity.org/royal-variety-performance/archive/detail/1979-london-theatre-royal|title=Performances :: 1979, London Theatre Royal &#124; Royal Variety Charity|website=Royalvarietycharity.org|access-date=May 12, 2023}}</ref> a moment Haley considered the proudest of his career. It was also the last time he performed in Europe and the last time most fans saw him perform \"Rock Around the Clock\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}\n\nHaley made his final performances in South Africa in May and June 1980. Just before the South African tour commenced, Haley's health was reportedly failing, and he was reportedly diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]]; a planned tour of Germany in the autumn of 1980 was subsequently cancelled.  The tour was critically lambasted, but surviving recordings of a performance in [[Johannesburg]] show Haley in good spirits and good voice. Nonetheless, according to the Haley News fan club newsletter and the Haley biography ''Sound and Glory'', planned concerts (such as a fall 1980 tour of Germany) and proposed recording sessions in New York and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] were cancelled, including a potential reunion with past members of the Comets.\n\nDespite his illness, Haley started compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he returned to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]]. \nThe October 25, 1980, issue of German tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' reported that Haley had a brain tumor. Haley's British manager, Patrick Malynn, was quoted as saying that \"Haley had taken a fit [and] didn't recognize anyone anymore.\" In addition, a doctor who examined Haley said that the tumor was inoperable.<ref name=\"Bill Haley 1982. page 154\">''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll''. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. p. 154, {{ISBN|0-8128-2909-3}}</ref>  Haley's widow Martha, who was with him in these troubling times, denied he had a brain tumor, as did his close friend Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Haley did not want to go on the road anymore and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. McCallum said, \"It's my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card.\"<ref name=FallingComet/>\n\nHaley returned to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]].  At this time, Haley's alcoholism appeared to be worsening. According to Martha, by this time, she and Haley fought all the time, and she told him to stop drinking or move out. Eventually, he moved into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes, he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. \"There were days we never saw him,\" said his daughter Martha Maria.<ref name=FallingComet/> In addition to Haley's drinking problems, it was becoming evident that he was also developing serious mental health issues. Martha Maria said, \"It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking.\" After being picked up by the police in Harlingen several times for alleged intoxication, Martha had a judge put Haley in the hospital, where he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said Haley's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction, but said Haley would have to stop drinking. Martha said, \"This is pointless.\" She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house, and the downward spiral continued until his death.<ref name=FallingComet/>\n\nMedia reports immediately following his death indicated that Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in the final weeks of his life. According to a biography of Haley by John Swenson, released in 1982,<ref name=\"Bill Haley 1982\">''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll'', pp. 155-159, John Swenson. (1982. Pub.

The single reached Number 50 in the UK but was not released in the United States.\n\nIn 1987, Bill Haley was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. At that time, supporting bands were not also named to the Hall of Fame. This policy was subsequently changed, and in 2012 a special committee of the Hall of Fame inducted the Comets.

The basic lineup of this group from 1987 to May 2006 was Marshall Lytle (bass), Joey Ambrose (sax), Johnny Grande (piano), Dick Richards (drums) and Franny Beecher (guitar). British singer Jacko Buddin augmented the group on vocals during most of their European tours, with Lytle taking over on vocals for US and Canadian tours beginning in 2000 and full-time in Europe in the mid-2000s. Since they connected with Klaus Kettner's Rock It Concerts (Germany) in 1991, they have played hundreds of shows all over Europe and have appeared on dozens of television shows. In March 2007 they opened the Bill-Haley-Museum in Munich, Germany.\n\nTwo additional groups claim the name '''Bill Haley's Comets''' and have extensively toured in the United States since forming in the 1980s: one originally led by Haley's 1965\u201368 drummer John \"Bam-Bam\" Lane, the other run by Al Rappa, who played bass for Haley off and on between late 1959 and early 1969. (The 1959 album \"Strictly Instrumental\" on Decca was Rappa's first recording session with Bill Haley & His Comets. Haley had used Rappa as a fill-in player on live gigs for several years prior to that.) Both these musicians claim [[trademark]] ownership of the name \"Bill Haley's Comets\"; this dates back to Lane and Rappa (during a period when they worked together as one band) winning a trademark infringement lawsuit against the aforementioned Joey Rand group in 1989. Both Rappa's and Lane's bands have, from time to time, recruited other former Comets for their lineups (for example, in 2005, Rappa joined forces with Joey Welz), but for the most part the bandleaders are the only regular members who have worked with Bill Haley directly. Lane died in 2007, but his group continues to perform, led by bandleader Lenny Longo, who has no direct connection with Bill Haley. Rappa incorporated numerous professional musicians from the southern Indiana area (Guitarist Warren Batts, Joe Esarey, Dave Matthews, Joe Denton, saxophonist John Urbina, bassist Jody Hamilton Miley (previous bassist with the George Jones Show), and others) to make a full band. Rappa performed his Upright Bass show before thousands in audiences all over the country. Members of Rappa's \"Comets\" went on to form the LocoMotion Showband and continued touring the United States without Rappa adding Galen Deig (Drums) and Jimmy Baze (Bass) before eventually disbanding. Esarey went on to graduate from Cedarville University and Luther Rice Theological Seminary. He has since pastored churches and produced his own saxophone instrumental albums. Several of the members are now active in a very popular Southern Indiana 50's / 60's band called The Duke Boys.\n\nIn March and July 2005, the members of the 1954\u201355 group, now billed as simply the Comets after decades of controversy over the use of the name, made several high-profile concert appearances in New York City and Los Angeles organized by [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] as part of celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of rock and roll, the release of ''Blackboard Jungle'', the 50th anniversary of \"Rock Around the Clock\" hitting Number 1, and the 80th birthday of Bill Haley.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-film-that-helped-launch-rock/ |title=The Film That Helped Launch Rock |work=CBS News |date=March 18, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604091217/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/18/sunday/main681742.shtml |archive-date=June 4, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Entertainment/5-06-29RocknRoll.htm |title=Rock 'N' Roll Turns 50 in July |publisher=Seniorjournal.com |date=June 29, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014044137/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Entertainment/5-06-29RocknRoll.htm |archive-date=October 14, 2011 }}</ref> During a concert at the [[Viper Room]] in [[West Hollywood]] on July 6, 2005, the Comets were joined on stage for one song by [[Gina Haley]], the youngest daughter of Bill Haley; at a similar appearance in March they were joined by Haley's eldest son, John W. Haley. The 1954\u201355 Comets were also joined on stage by Bill Haley Jr. during several appearances in 2005 at Bubba Mac's in Somers Point, New Jersey, and at a 2005 concert recognizing the tenure of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen at the Twin Bars in Gloucester City, New Jersey.\n\nIn 2006, the 1954\u201355 Comets spent much of the year in residence at Dick Clark's American Bandstand Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]]. Meanwhile, the John Lane edition of Bill Haley's Comets recorded an album in Tennessee in early 2006, which has yet to be released.\n\nOn June 2, 2006, Johnny Grande, keyboardist with the 1954\u201355 Comets and a founding member of the band, died after a short illness. The following month, 85-year-old guitarist [[Franny Beecher]] announced his retirement, though he was at one point announced as participating in an early 2007 tour of Germany. The three remaining original Comets (Lytle, Richards, and Ambrose) continued to perform in Branson with new musicians taking over the keyboard and lead guitar positions. During September 2006, [[PBS]] in the United States aired a series of programs videotaped in Branson during the spring of 2006; these shows include the last recorded performances of the complete Original Comets lineup, including Grande. Lytle died in 2013, Beecher in 2014. The last remaining members of the 1954\u201355 Comets, Dick Richards and Joey Ambrose, continued to perform as the Comets as of mid-2018, sometimes augmented by 1970s-era Comet Bill Turner on lead guitar.\n\nJohn \"Bam-Bam\" Lane died on February 18, 2007<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra.html |title=\"EXTRA!\" Page 1 / Bill Haley and the Comets |publisher=Rockabillyhall.com |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016214241/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra.html |archive-date=October 16, 2011 }}</ref> but his edition of Bill Haley's Comets is expected to continue touring, with the 2006 recordings to be released in Lane's memory.\n\nOn October 27, 2007, ex-Comets guitar player Bill Turner opened the aforementioned Bill-Haley-Museum in Munich, Germany.

They had two other sons, Cecil (1934\u201389) and James (1932\u20132010). The family soon moved to [[Beaumont, Texas]]. Richardson graduated from Beaumont High School in 1947 and played on the \"Royal Purple\" American football team as a defensive lineman, wearing number 85.<ref>''Big Bopper: From Head Waiter To Rock'N'Roll Hero''. T Knight \u2013 Goldmine, 1989</ref> Richardson later was a radio [[disc jockey]] while at [[Lamar University|Lamar College]],<ref name=b&m /> where he studied prelaw and was a member of the band and chorus.\n\n== Career ==\n=== Radio ===\nRichardson worked part-time at [[Beaumont, Texas]] radio station KTRM (now [[KZZB]]). He was hired by the station full-time in 1949 and quit college. Richardson married Adrianne Joy Fryou on April 18, 1952, and their daughter Debra Joy was born in December 1953, soon after Richardson was promoted to supervisor of announcers at KTRM. In March 1955, he was [[conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]] and did his basic training at [[Fort Ord]], California. Richardson spent the rest of his two-year service as a radar instructor at [[Fort Bliss]] in [[El Paso, Texas]]. In March 1957, following his discharge as a corporal, Richardson returned to KTRM radio, where he held down the \"Dishwashers' Serenade\" shift from 11&nbsp;a.m. to 12:30&nbsp;p.m., Monday to Friday.\n\nOne of the station's sponsors wanted Richardson for a new time slot, and suggested an idea for a show. Richardson had seen college students doing a dance called The Bop, and he decided to call himself \"The Big Bopper\". His new radio show ran from 3:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m., and he soon became the station's program director. In May 1957, Richardson broke the record for continuous on-air broadcasting by eight minutes. He performed for a total of five days, two hours, and eight minutes from a remote setup in the lobby of the [[Jefferson Theatre]] in downtown Beaumont, playing 1,821 records<ref name=accuracy /> and taking showers during five-minute newscasts.<ref name=\"b&m\">[https://www.bopperandme.co.uk/petition.php] {{dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref> Richardson is credited for creating the first music video in 1958, and recorded an early example himself.<ref name=accuracy>{{cite web|url=https://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Richardson,J.P.TheBigBopper.html|title=J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson|website=Accuracyproject.org|accessdate=January 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Singer and songwriter ===\n[[File:Big Bopper's Wedding - Little Red Riding Hood ad - Cash Box 1958.jpg|thumb|Advertisement featured in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine, 13 December 1958]] \nRichardson, who played guitar, began his musical career as a songwriter. [[George Jones]] later recorded Richardson's \"[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]\", which became Jones's first No. 1 country hit in 1959 (#73 on the pop charts). Richardson also wrote \"[[Running Bear]]\" for [[Johnny Preston]], his friend from [[Port Arthur, Texas]]. The inspiration for the song came from Richardson's childhood memory of the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]], where he heard stories about [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes. Preston's recording was not released until August 1959, six months after Richardson's death. The song became a No. 1 hit for three weeks in January 1960. The man who launched Richardson as a recording artist was [[Pappy Daily|Harold \"Pappy\" Daily]] from [[Houston]]. Daily was promotion director for [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] and [[Starday Records]] and signed Richardson to Mercury. Richardson's first single, \"Beggar to a King\", had a country flavor, but failed to gain any chart action.\n\nRichardson soon cut \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" as \"The Big Bopper\"<ref name=pc14>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19763/m1/ |title= Show 14 \u2013 Big Rock Candy Mountain: Rock 'n' roll in the late fifties |show=14}}</ref> for Pappy Daily's [[D (record label)|D label]]. Mercury bought the recording and released it at the end of June 1958.

In November 1958, he scored a second hit, a raucous novelty tune entitled \"The Big Bopper's Wedding\", in which Richardson pretends to be getting [[cold feet]] at the altar.

His son, Jay Perry Richardson, was born two months after his death, in April 1959. Richardson had been building a recording studio in his home in [[Beaumont, Texas]], and was planning to invest in a radio station. Richardson had written 20 new songs that he planned to record himself or with other artists. His son also followed a musical career and was known professionally as \"The Big Bopper, Jr.\", performing around the world. He toured on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour with Buddy Holly impersonator John Mueller on some of the same stages where his father had performed.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nIn January 2007, Jay Richardson requested that his father's body be exhumed and an autopsy be performed in response to an internet rumor about guns being fired aboard the aircraft and Richardson initially surviving the crash.<ref>{{cite news|title=Autopsy of 'Big Bopper' to Address Rumors About 1959 Plane Crash|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/17/AR2007011701976.html|website=Washingtonpost.com|date=January 18, 2007}}</ref> The autopsy was performed by [[William M.

On the 11th night of the tour (February 2, 1959), they played at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]]. That night, Holly chartered an airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]], intending to fly himself and his bandmates [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Tommy Allsup]] to their next tour venue in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. The musicians had been traveling by bus for over a week, and it had already broken down twice. They were tired, they had not been paid yet, and all of their clothes were dirty. The chartered flight would allow them to avoid another arduous bus ride, arrive early before the Moorhead show, do their laundry, and get some rest. Local pilot [[Roger Peterson (pilot)|Roger Peterson]] of Dwyer Flying Service (age 21) had agreed to take them. The weather forecast for the Clear Lake area was {{convert|18|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} that night with moderate gusty winds and light scattered snow, and Peterson was fatigued from a 17-hour workday, but he agreed to fly the trip.\n\n[[Frankie Sardo]] went to meet the crowd while Holly went into one of the dressing rooms at the Surf Ballroom where he notified Allsup and Jennings that he had chartered a plane to take them to [[Fargo, North Dakota]] (which is directly adjacent to Moorhead, Minnesota). On a friendly wager, Valens flipped a coin with Allsup for his seat on the plane\u2014and won. Meanwhile, J.P. Richardson was suffering from the flu and was complaining that the bus was too cold and uncomfortable for him, so Jennings voluntarily surrendered his seat. Upon hearing that his bandmates had given away their plane seats, Holly joked, \"Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up again.\" Jennings jokingly replied, \"Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-how-waylon-jennings-survived-the-day-the-music-died-122992/ |title=Flashback: How Waylon Jennings Survived Buddy Holly Crash |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=February 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe Clear Lake show ended at around midnight and Holly, Valens, and Richardson drove to the Mason City Airport, loaded their luggage and boarded the red and white single-engine [[Beechcraft Bonanza]]. Peterson received clearance from the control tower around 12:55&nbsp;a.m. on February 3, 1959, and they took off\u2014but the plane remained airborne for only a few minutes. It crashed at full throttle shortly after takeoff about 5 miles outside Mason City in the middle of farm country. The reason remains unknown but Peterson may have lost his visual reference and thought that he was ascending while he was actually descending. The right wingtip of the Bonanza hit the frozen ground and sent the aircraft cartwheeling across a cleared cornfield at approximately {{convert|170|mph}}.\n\nHolly, Valens and Richardson were thrown from the airplane on impact and likely tumbled along with the wreckage across the icy field before the wreckage of the aircraft came to rest against a barbed-wire fence, while Peterson's body remained entangled in the wreckage. The bodies of Holly and Valens came to rest several feet away from the wreckage on open ground; Richardson was thrown approximately {{convert|100|feet}} beyond the wreckage across the fence line and into the next cornfield. All three died instantly of head and chest injuries. Richardson was 28 years old.\n\n== Compositions ==\n* \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\", No. 6 hit for the Big Bopper\n* \"[[The Purple People Eater]] Meets the [[Witch Doctor (song)|Witch Doctor]]\"\n* \"Little Red Riding Hood\"\n* \"Walking Through My Dreams\" (two versions, one on 45-RPM only, the other on LP)\n* \"Beggar to a King\" (recorded under his real name), (later recorded by [[Hank Snow]] in 1961, it made it to No. 5 on the country singles chart)\n* \"Crazy Blues\" (recorded under his real name)\n* \"Bopper's Boogie Woogie\"\n* \"That's What I'm Talking About\"\n* \"Pink Petticoats\"\n* \"Monkey Song (You Made a Monkey out of Me)\"\n* \"It's the Truth, Ruth\" (two versions, one on 45-RPM only, the other on LP)\n* \"Preacher and the Bear\"\n* \"Someone Watching Over You\"\n* \"Old Maid\"\n* \"Strange Kisses\"\n* \"Teenage Moon\"\n* \"The Clock\"\n* \"One More Chance\"\n* \"She Giggles\"\n* \"The Big Bopper's Wedding\"\n\n=== Songwriting ===\n* \"[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightnin']]\", No. 1 Country hit for George Jones\n* \"[[Treasure of Love]]\", No. 6 Country hit for George Jones\n* \"[[Running Bear]]\", No. 1 hit for Johnny Preston and [[Sonny James]]\n\n== Tributes ==\n[[File:HollyMonument.jpg|thumb|right|Monument at crash site, September 16, 2003]]\nIn 1988, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin fan of the 1950s era, erected a stainless steel monument at the crash site depicting a guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of each of the three performers.

Richardson's pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. The Big Bopper is fondly remembered not only for his distinctive singing and songwriting, but also as a humorist who combined the best elements of country, R&B, and rock 'n' roll.\n\nIn 2010, Richardson was inducted into the [[Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iowarocknroll.com/big-bopper |title=Big Bopper &#124; iowarocknroll |access-date=November 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627120647/https://www.iowarocknroll.com/big-bopper |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRichardson's name is mentioned as one of the upcoming musical acts in both the print and television versions of [[Stephen King]]'s short story \"[[You Know They Got a Hell of a Band]]\" about a town inhabited by late musical legends.

She performed on television in the UK in 1959, before she had achieved much pop recognition in the United States. Her first hit single in the UK was \"[[Sweet Nothin's]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;4 on the UK singles chart in the spring of 1960. She subsequently had a UK hit (in 1961) with \"[[Let's Jump the Broomstick]]\", a rockabilly number recorded in 1959, which had not charted in the United States, but reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK.<ref name=Bernstein />\n\nLee had two Top Ten hits in the UK that were not released as singles in her native country: the first, \"[[Speak to Me Pretty]]\" peaked at No.&nbsp;3 in May 1962 and was her greatest hit in the UK by chart placing, swiftly followed by \"[[Here Comes That Feeling]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;5 in the summer of 1962. The latter was issued as the B-side to \"[[Everybody Loves Me But You]]\" in the United States (which peaked at No.&nbsp;6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100); however, \"Here Comes That Feeling\" also made an appearance in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, peaking at No.&nbsp;89, despite its B-side status in the US.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}\n\nIn 1962, while touring [[West Germany]], Lee appeared at the [[Star-Club]], [[Hamburg]], with the Beatles as the opening act.<ref name=Bernstein /> Lee also had big hits in the UK with \"[[All Alone Am I]]\" (No.&nbsp;7 in 1963) and \"[[As Usual]]\" (No.&nbsp;5 in 1964).{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}\n\nLee first visited England for three days in April 1959 as a last-minute replacement on ''[[Oh Boy!

The follow-up, the [[Mark James (songwriter)|Mark James]] composition \"[[Sunday Sunrise (song)|Sunday Sunrise]]\", reached No.&nbsp;6 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]''{{'s}} Hot Country Singles chart that October.

Two follow-ups also reached the Top 10 in 1980: \"[[The Cowgirl and the Dandy]]\" and \"[[Broken Trust]]\" (the latter featuring vocal backing by [[the Oak Ridge Boys]]). A 1982 album, ''[[The Winning Hand]]'', featuring Lee along with [[Dolly Parton]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Willie Nelson]], was a surprise hit, reaching the top ten on the U.S. country albums chart. Her last well-known hit was 1984's \"[[Hallelujah, I Love Her So]]\" in duet with [[George Jones]] (Lee sang this song individually before and released it in 1960 on ''[[This Is...Brenda]]'').

He was born to a musical family in [[Lubbock, Texas]], during the [[Great Depression]], and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. Holly's style was country and western music which he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school.\n\nHolly made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group Buddy and Bob with his friend [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]]. In 1955, after opening for [[Elvis Presley]] as part of the Louisiana Hayride's habit of seeking out local bands to add to the show, Holly decided to pursue a career in music. Subsequently, he played with Presley three times that year and his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when Holly opened for [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], he was spotted by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with [[Decca Records]].\n\nHolly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by [[Owen Bradley]], who had become famous for producing orchestrated country hits for stars like [[Patsy Cline]]. Unhappy with Bradley's musical style and control in the studio, Holly went to producer [[Norman Petty]] in [[Clovis, New Mexico]], and recorded a demo of \"[[That'll Be the Day]]\", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to [[Brunswick Records]], which released it as a single credited to [[The Crickets]], a name chosen by the band to subvert Decca's contract limitations. It became the name of Holly's band. In September 1957, as the band toured, \"That'll Be the Day\" topped the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957|US]] and [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] singles charts. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, \"[[Peggy Sue]]\".\n\nThe album ''[[The \"Chirping\" Crickets]]'', released in November 1957, reached number five on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Holly made his second appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in January 1958 and soon after toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of future country music star [[Waylon Jennings]] (bass), famed session musician [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums), and embarked on a tour of the mid-western US. After a show in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly, [[Ritchie Valens]], [[The Big Bopper]], and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by [[Don McLean]] as \"[[The Day the Music Died]]\" in his song \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\".\n\nDuring his short career, Holly wrote and recorded many songs. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums.  This was unfounded considering he first saw Elvis with this line-up in Lubbock in 1955 when Holly was strictly a country music band. Holly was a major influence on later popular music artists, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Brian May]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[the Hollies]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[Fiona Apple]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Marshall Crenshaw]], [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Elton John]]. Holly was among the first artists inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in 1986. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of 100 Greatest Artists in 2010. Holly was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=swieser@panolawatchman.com |first=Stella Wieser |date=2022-08-10 |title=Texas Country Music Hall of Fame announces 2022 inductees |url=https://www.panolawatchman.com/news/texas-country-music-hall-of-fame-announces-2022-inductees/article_359dcf74-16de-11ed-9286-4396dc593295.html |access-date=2024-09-26 |website=Panola Watchman |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life and career (1936\u20131955)===\nCharles Hardin Holley (spelled \"-ey\") was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], on September 7, 1936, the youngest of four children of Lawrence Odell \"L.O.\" Holley (1901\u20131985) and Ella Pauline Drake (1902\u20131990).

Buddy Holly was baptized a Baptist, and the family were members of the Tabernacle Baptist Church.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=12}}\n\nThe Holleys had an interest in music; all the family members except L.O. were able to play an instrument or sing. The elder Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin. Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the bow so it would not make any sound. The brothers won the contest.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=13}} During World War II, Larry and Travis were called to military service. Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific. At age 11, at his mother's urging, Buddy took piano lessons but abandoned them after nine months. He switched to the guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus. Buddy's parents initially bought him a [[steel guitar]], but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother's. His parents bought him an acoustic guitar from a local pawnshop, and he learned how to play it from Travis.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=14}}\n\nDuring his early childhood, Holly was influenced by the music of [[Hank Williams]], [[Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Moon Mullican]], [[Bill Monroe]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Bob Wills]], and the [[Carter Family]]. At Roscoe Wilson Elementary, Holly became friends with [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]], and the two played together, practicing with songs by [[The Louvin Brothers]] and [[Johnnie & Jack]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=34}} They both listened to the radio programs ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on [[WSM (AM)|WSM]], ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' on [[KWKH]], and ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. At the same time, Holly played with other musicians he met in high school, including [[Sonny Curtis]] and [[Jerry Allison]].{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|p=80|2007}} In 1952 Holly and Jack Neal participated as a duo billed as Buddy and Jack in a talent contest on a local television show. After Neal left, he was replaced by Bob Montgomery, and they were billed as Buddy and Bob. They soon started performing on the ''Sunday Party'' show on [[KDAV]] in 1953 and performed live gigs in Lubbock.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=6|2003}} At that time, Holly was influenced by late-night radio stations that played blues and rhythm and blues (R&B). He would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could only be received at night, when local transmissions ceased.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=7|2003}} Holly then modified his music by blending his earlier [[country and western]] influence with R&B.{{sfn|Wishart|p=540|2004}} We do know it wasn't until Holly saw Elvis in Lubbock that led him to follow the Presley example.\n\nBy 1955, after graduating from [[Lubbock High School]], Holly decided to pursue a full-time career in music. He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley perform live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV. In February, Holly opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum. By that time, Holly had incorporated into his band Larry Welborn on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from country and western to [[rock and roll]] due to seeing Presley's performances and hearing his music.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=7|2003}} In October, Stone booked Bill Haley & His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall. Impressed, Crandall persuaded [[Grand Ole Opry]] manager Jim Denny to seek a recording contract for Holley. Stone sent a demo tape, which Denny forwarded to [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], who signed the band to [[Decca Records]] in February 1956.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|p=130|1997}} In the contract, Decca misspelled Holly's surname as \"Holly\", and from then on he was known as Buddy Holly, instead of his real name Holley.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}\n\nOn January 26, 1956, Holly attended his first formal recording session, which was produced by [[Owen Bradley]].{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=97}} He attended two more sessions in Nashville, but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements, Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} In April 1956, Decca released \"[[Blue Days, Black Nights]]\" as a single, with \"Love Me\" on the B-side. Denny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for [[Faron Young]]. During the tour, they were promoted as Buddy Holly and the Two Tones, while later Decca called them Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} The label later released Holly's second single \"Modern Don Juan\", [[b-side|backed with]] \"You Are My One Desire\". Neither single made an impression. On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed, but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.{{sfn|Uslan|Solomon|1981|p=49}}\n\n===The Crickets (1956\u20131957) ===\n{{Main article|The Crickets}}\n[[File:Buddy Holly & The Crickets publicity portrait - cropped.jpg|Buddy Holly and the Crickets in 1957 (top to bottom: Allison, Holly and Mauldin)|thumb]]\nHolly was unhappy with the results of his time with Decca, and inspired by the success of [[Buddy Knox]]'s \"[[Party Doll]]\" and [[Jimmy Bowen]]'s \"[[I'm Stickin' with You]]\", he visited [[Norman Petty]], who had produced and promoted both records. Together with Allison, bassist [[Joe B. Mauldin]], and rhythm guitarist [[Niki Sullivan]], he went to Petty's studio in [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The group recorded a demo of \"[[That'll Be the Day]]\", a song they had previously recorded in Nashville. In June 1956, Holly along with his older brother Larry as well as Allison and [[Sonny Curtis]] had gone to see the film ''[[The Searchers]]'', starring [[John Wayne]], in which Wayne repeatedly used the phrase \"That'll be the day\". This line of dialogue inspired the young musicians.<ref>Trzcinski, Matthew (February 10, 2022).

Petty became his manager and sent the record to [[Brunswick Records]] in New York City. Holly, still under contract with Decca, could not release the record under his name, so a band name was used; Allison proposed the name \"Crickets.\" Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release \"That'll Be the Day\", leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Amburn |first=Ellis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EAGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT101 |title=Buddy Holly: A Biography |date=April 22, 2014 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=9781466868564 |page=101 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>\n\nImpressed with the demo, the label's executives released it without recording a new version. \"I'm Looking for Someone to Love\" was the B-side; the single was credited to [[The Crickets]]. Petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca, which legally cleared future recordings under the name Buddy Holly. Recordings credited to the Crickets would be released on Brunswick, while the recordings under Holly's name were released on another subsidiary label, [[Coral Records]]. Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=131}}\n\nNorman Petty reasoned correctly that disc jockeys would be reluctant to play and promote multiple new records by the same artist, but would have no problem playing these same records if they were credited to different performers. Holly himself was unaware of this strategy; in a 1957 radio interview with Dale Lowery, Holly said, \"We have three records going out right now. Of course, the first one was 'That'll Be the Day', the first one released. Then we have a new one out by The Crickets, called 'Oh Boy!' and 'Not Fade Away', and then there's one out, it's the same group but it's under my name -- I don't know why they did it that way, but it went out under my name -- called 'Peggy Sue' and 'Everyday'.\"<ref>Buddy Holly interviewed by Dale Lowery for KTOP radio (Topeka, Kansas), 1957.</ref> Holly's records were released with labels reading \"Buddy Holly\" ''or'' \"The Crickets\"; the band was never credited on records as \"Buddy Holly ''and'' the Crickets\" until 1962, when a compilation album was released.\n\n\"That'll Be the Day\" was released on July 27, 1957. Petty booked Holly and the Crickets for a tour with [[Irvin Feld]], who had noticed the band after \"That'll Be the Day\" appeared on the R&B chart. He booked them for appearances in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and New York City.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=16}} The band was booked to play at New York's [[Apollo Theater]] on August 16\u201322. During the opening performances, the group did not impress the audience, but they were accepted after they included \"[[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|Bo Diddley]].\" By the end of their run at the Apollo, \"That'll Be the Day\" was climbing the charts. Encouraged by the single's success, Petty started to prepare two album releases; a solo album for Holly and another for the Crickets.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=17}} Holly appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], on August 26. Before leaving New York, the band befriended [[The Everly Brothers]].{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=18}}\n[[File:That'll Be the Day ad - Cash Box 1957.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' advertisement, August 3, 1957]] \n\"That'll Be the Day\" topped the [[Number-one hits of 1957 (United States)|US \"Best Sellers in Stores\"]] chart on September 23 and was number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in November.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=19}} Three days prior, Coral released \"[[Peggy Sue]]\", backed with \"[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]\", with Holly credited as the performer. By October, \"Peggy Sue\" had reached number three on ''Billboard''{{'}}s pop chart and number two on the R&B chart; it peaked at number six on the UK Singles chart. As the success of the song grew, it brought more attention to Holly, with the band at the time being billed as \"Buddy Holly and the Crickets\"{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=57}} (although never on records during Holly's lifetime).\n\nIn the last week of September, the band members flew to Lubbock to visit their families.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=58}} Holly's high school girlfriend, Echo McGuire, had left him for a fellow student.{{sfn|Norman|p=156|1996}} Aside from McGuire, Holly had a relationship with Lubbock fan June Clark.{{sfn|Norman|p=127|1996}} After Clark ended their relationship, Holly realized the importance of his relationship with McGuire and considered his relationship with Clark a temporary one.{{sfn|Norman|p=156|1996}} Meanwhile, for their return to recording, Petty arranged a session in [[Oklahoma City]], where he was performing with his own band. While the band drove to the location, the producer set up a makeshift studio. The rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded; Petty later dubbed the material in Clovis.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=58}} The resulting album, ''[[The \"Chirping\" Crickets]]'', was released on November 27, 1957. It reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. In October, Brunswick released the second single by the Crickets, \"[[Oh, Boy! (The Crickets song)|Oh, Boy!]]\", with \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" on the B-side.

Upon their return to the United States, Holly and the Crickets joined Alan Freed's ''Big Beat Show'' tour for 41 dates.

The session produced the recordings of \"[[It's So Easy! (The Crickets song)|It's So Easy]]\" and \"[[Heartbeat (Buddy Holly song)|Heartbeat]].\" Holly was impressed by Allsup and invited him to join the Crickets. In June, Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session. Without the Crickets, he chose to be backed by a jazz and R&B band, recording \"Now We're One\" and [[Bobby Darin]]'s \"[[Early in the Morning (Bobby Darin song)|Early in the Morning]].\"{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=91}}\n\nDuring a visit to the offices of [[Peermusic|Peer-Southern]], Holly met [[Mar\u00eda Elena Santiago]]. He asked her out on their first meeting and proposed marriage to her on their first date. The wedding took place on August 15. Norman Petty had tried to dissuade Holly from marriage; he felt that it would disappoint Holly's public and damage his career.\n\nHolly and Santiago frequented many of New York's music venues, including the [[Village Gate]], Blue Note, [[Village Vanguard]], and Johnny Johnson's. Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar and that he would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there. Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll. He wanted to make an album with [[Ray Charles]] and [[Mahalia Jackson]]. Holly also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=281}}\n\nSantiago accompanied Holly on tours. To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets' secretary. She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up and collected the concert revenues. Santiago kept the money for the band instead of its habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico.{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=274}} She and her aunt Provi Garcia, an executive in the Latin American music department at Peer-Southern, convinced Holly that Petty was paying the band's royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company's account. Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and to later fire him as manager and producer. At the recommendation of the Everly Brothers, Holly hired lawyer Harold Orenstein to negotiate his royalties.{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=280}} The problems with Petty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly. At the time, New York promoter Manny Greenfield reclaimed a large part of Holly's earnings; Greenfield had booked Holly for shows during previous tours. The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings. Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly's manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused. Greenfield then sued Holly. Under New York law, because Holly's royalties originated in New York and were directed out of the state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled.{{sfn|Laing|p=153|2010}}\n\nIn September, Holly returned to Clovis for a new recording session, which yielded \"Reminiscing\" and \"Come Back Baby.\" During the session, he ventured into producing by recording Lubbock DJ [[Waylon Jennings]]. Holly produced the single \"Jole Blon\" and \"When Sin Stops (Love Begins)\" for Jennings.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=155}} Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music, recording, and publishing scene. Holly and Santiago settled in Apartment 4H of the Brevoort Apartments, at 11 Fifth Avenue in [[Greenwich Village]], where he recorded a series of acoustic songs, including \"[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]\" and \"What to Do.\"{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=274\u2013278}} The inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship with McGuire.{{sfn|Lloyd Webber|2015}}\n\nOn October 21, 1958, Holly's final studio session was recorded at the [[Pythian Temple (New York City)|Pythian Temple]] on West 70th Street (now a luxury condominium). Known by Holly fans as \"the string sessions\", Holly recorded four songs for Coral in an innovative collaboration with an 18-piece ensemble composed of former members of the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] (including saxophonist [[Boomie Richman]]) under the direction of [[Dick Jacobs]].\n\nThe four songs recorded during the {{frac|3|1|2}}-hour session were: \n*\"True Love Ways\" (written by Buddy Holly), \n*\"[[Moondreams (Norman Petty song)|Moondreams]]\" (written by [[Norman Petty]]), \n*\"[[Raining in My Heart]]\" (written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant) and \n*\"[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]\" (written by Paul Anka).{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=276\u2013278}}\nThese four songs were the only ones Coral ever mixed in stereo, but only \"Raining in My Heart\" was released that way (in 1959, on an obscure promotional LP titled ''Hitsville''). All four records otherwise received releases in mono. The original stereo mixes were consulted many years later for compilation albums.\n\nHolly ended his association with Petty in December 1958. His band members kept Petty as their manager and split from Holly. The split was amicable and based on logistics: Holly had decided to settle permanently in New York, where the business and publishing offices were, and the Crickets preferred not to leave their home state.\n\n===Winter Dance Party tour and death (1959)===\n{{Main|The Day the Music Died}}\n[[File:GlassesSign.jpg|thumb|right|Signpost near the Clear Lake crash site]]\n\nHolly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings's radio station in December 1958.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 51}} For the start of the [[Winter Dance Party]] tour, he assembled a band consisting of [[Waylon Jennings]] (electric bass), [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums).{{sfn|Corbin, Sky|2014}} Holly and Jennings left for New York City, arriving on January 15, 1959.

The amount of travel involved created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer, Carl Bunch, was hospitalized for [[frostbite]] to his toes (sustained while aboard the bus), so Holly decided to seek other transportation.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA13 13]}} On February 2, before their appearance in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered a four-seat [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] airplane for Jennings, Allsup, and himself, from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]]. Holly's idea was to depart following the show at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue, in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], via [[Fargo, North Dakota]], allowing them time to rest and launder their clothes and avoid an arduous bus journey. Immediately after the Clear Lake show (which ended just before midnight), Allsup agreed to flip a coin for the seat with [[Ritchie Valens]]. Valens called heads; when he won, he reportedly said, \"That's the first time I've ever won anything in my life.\" Allsup later opened a restaurant/bar in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], called Heads Up Saloon.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Galloway |first=Paul |date=June 24, 1988 |title=Hit parade |work=Chicago Tribune |id={{ProQuest|882608515}}}}</ref> Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to [[The Big Bopper|J.

However, an autopsy done at the request of Richardson's son in 2007 found no evidence to support the rumors.

The following day, she suffered a miscarriage. Holly's mother, who heard the news on the radio in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. Because of Elena's miscarriage, in the months following the accident, some government authorities implemented a policy against announcing victims' names until after families are informed.{{sfn|Suddath|2009}} Santiago did not attend the funeral and has never visited the gravesite.

The finished tracks became the first posthumous Holly single, \"[[Peggy Sue Got Married (song)|Peggy Sue Got Married]]\"/\"[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]].\" The new release was successful enough to warrant an album drawing upon the other Holly demos, using the same studio personnel, in January 1960.<ref>Goldrosen, John (1979).

During the January 1969 recording sessions for their album ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'', the Beatles played a slow, impromptu version of \"Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues\" \u2013 which Holly popularized but did not write \u2013 with Lennon mimicking Holly's vocal style.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2014|p=186}} Lennon recorded a cover version of \"Peggy Sue\" on his 1975 album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]''.{{sfn|Blaney, John|p=163|2005}} McCartney owns the [[Music publisher|publishing rights]] to Holly's song catalog.{{sfn|BBC News staff|2003}}\n\n==== Bob Dylan ====\nOn January 31, 1959, two nights before Holly's death, 17-year-old [[Bob Dylan]] attended Holly's performance in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. Dylan referred to this in his acceptance speech when he received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] for ''[[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|Time Out of Mind]]'' in 1998: \"...&nbsp;when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at [[Duluth National Guard Armory]] and I was three feet away from him&nbsp;... and he looked at me.

The Rolling Stones had a hit version of the song in 1964.{{sfn|Norman|p=12|2011}} Richards later said, \"[Holly] passed it on via the Beatles and via [the Rolling Stones]&nbsp;...&nbsp;He's in everybody.\"{{sfn|Amburn, Ellis|2014|p=274}}\n\n==== Steve Marriott ====\nFrom a young age, [[Steve Marriott]] was a huge fan of Holly and would mimic his hero by wearing large-rimmed spectacles with the lenses removed. Marriott wrote his first song, called \"Shelia My Dear\", after his aunt Shelia to whom he was close. Those who heard the song said it was played at a jaunty pace in the style of Holly and his bandmates also nicknamed him 'Buddy'.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hewitt |first1=Paolo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4fwswEACAAJ |title=Steve Marriott: All Too Beautiful |last2=Hellier |first2=John |date=2004 |publisher=Helter Skelter Publishing |isbn=978-1-900924-44-3 |pages=44 |language=en}}</ref> Marriott also recorded a version of [[Kenny Lynch]]'s song \"Give Her My Regards\" b/w \"Imaginary Love\", the B-side written by Marriott, and released as a [[Single (music)|45-rpm]] in 1963 on Decca, inspired by Buddy Holly and the Crickets.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/master/907139-Steve-Marriott-Give-Her-My-Regards \"Steve Marriott - Give Her My Regards\"].

The song's lyric, which calls the incident \"The Day the Music Died\", became popularly associated with the crash. McLean's album ''[[American Pie (Don McLean album)|American Pie]]'' is dedicated to Holly.{{sfn|Crouse, Richard|p=86|2012}} In 2015, McLean wrote, \"Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments&nbsp;...&nbsp;By the time he was 22 years old, he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself&nbsp;...&nbsp;in my view and the view of many others, a hit&nbsp;...&nbsp;Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed.\"{{sfn|McLean|2015}}\n\n==== Eric Clapton ====\n''The Chirping Crickets'' was the first album [[Eric Clapton]] ever bought; he later saw Holly on ''Sunday Night at the London Palladium''. In his autobiography, Clapton recounted the first time he saw Holly and his Fender, saying, \"I thought I'd died and gone to heaven&nbsp;...&nbsp;it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself: 'That's the future \u2013 that's what I want{{'\"}}.{{sfn|Clapton, Eric|p=19|2010}} In 1969, his supergroup [[Blind Faith]] released a cover version of Holly's \"Well All Right\" featuring [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gallucci |first=Michael |date=January 11, 2023 |title=Top 10 Jeff Beck Songs |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jeff-beck-songs/ |access-date=May 22, 2024 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Bobby Vee====\nThe launch of [[Bobby Vee]]'s successful musical career resulted from Holly's death; Vee was selected to replace Holly on the tour that continued after the plane crash.

Originally from New Jersey, he formed Red Wanting Blue in the fall of 1995. In 1996 Red Wanting Blue released their first full-length album titled ''Velveteen''.  While still in college in 1998, the band went on to release their second full-length album ''The Image Trigger''.\n\n===''Model Citizen'' (2000\u20132001)===\n''Model Citizen'' was RWB's third studio release and arguably their breakthrough album. It was the first album with current bassist, Mark McCullough. After the release of ''Model Citizen'', Red Wanting Blue started gaining media attention for their rapidly growing grassroots following. The original version of the song ''Audition'' was recorded for this album. The song was picked up nationally by [[Abercrombie and Fitch]] and placed on rotation at their stores throughout the US. ''Audition'' was later re-vamped and re-recorded for the 2011 album ''From the Vanishing Point'' and found success on the radio and television in 2012 and 2013.\n\n===''Sirens'' (2001\u20132002)===\n''Sirens'' is Red Wanting Blue's fourth studio release. The band would eventually dedicate ''Sirens'' to those lives lost during the [[September 11 attacks]]. Red Wanting Blue toured to support ''Sirens'' by headlining small rock clubs across the US.\n\n===''Souvenirs of City Life'' (2002\u20132003)===\n''Souvenirs of City Life'' is the band's fifth studio release. ''Souvenirs of City Life'' debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on [[Aware Records]] online store \u2013 awarestore.com. Red Wanting Blue toured extensively during this time period headlining rock clubs and also touring alongside longtime friends [[O.A.R.

Honored, the band thanked those fans in the liner notes of this album. RWB picked up an additional member, guitarist, keyboardist and back-up vocalist Greg Rahm. RWB independently set out on a large tour (headlining venues from mid-level clubs to small theaters) stretching from New York to California. Songs from this album found themselves on [[XM Satellite Radio]]. During this time RWB was featured as an unsigned band to watch on Demodiaries.com, Kings of A&R and Hits Magazine. \n\n===''The Warehouse Sessions'' (2006\u20132008)===\n''The Warehouse Sessions'' is a live album/DVD recorded in the band's warehouse and studio space in front of 100 of RWB biggest fans from across the country. Tickets to this intimate event sold out in under two minutes. ''The Warehouse Sessions'' debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on Awarestore.com ([[Aware Records]] online store) in its first week of pre-sale. It was made to bridge the gap between ''Pride: The Cold Lover'' and 2008's ''These Magnificent Miles''. This album/DVD featured early acoustic versions of fan favorites \"You Are My Las Vegas\" and \"Finger in the Air\" from ''These Magnificent Miles''.\n\n===''These Magnificent Miles'' (2008\u20132010)===\n[[File:Centennial Concert (4268332410).jpg|thumb|Performing at [[Anderson Arena]] in 2010.]]\nThe band enlisted Grammy nominated producer Jamie Candiloro ([[Ryan Adams]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Willie Nelson]]) for ''These Magnificent Miles''. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] is quoted as saying that this album was inspired by \"the circus life of a band on the road.\" Current guitarist Eric Hall began his career with Red Wanting Blue during this time period. The band settled into an Americana rock \u2018n\u2019 roll vibe utilizing more melodic sounds than that of their prior work. Drummer Dean Anshutz joined the band toward the end of this album cycle.\n\nAfter signing with Fanatic Records in April 2010, ''These Magnificent Miles'' was re-released nationally on July 27, 2010, for a wider audience. Fanatic also issued a deluxe double-LP edition of ''These Magnificent Miles'' with full-color LP sleeves featuring the art of John Terry ([[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]]'s brother). In September 2010, the single \"Where You Wanna Go\" was heard on radio stations across the country. An eccentric music video was released for \"Where You Wanna Go\" featuring the band finding themselves trapped in an Alice in Wonderland type setting. Red Wanting Blue settled into a rhythm on tour of nearly selling out venues in advance (large rock clubs and mid-sized theaters), most shows during this time period selling out by day of show. The band's following in major cities like NYC started doubling in size with each live concert.\n\nRed Wanting Blue was commissioned to write a song for the film \"Unraveled\". The song called \"Magic Man\" was released as a single and is played in its entirety during the film. The documentary \"These Magnificent Miles \u2013 On the Long Road with Red Wanting Blue\" was released in April 2011. The band does not sell or support the documentary. On April 13, 2011, lead singer [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] was the guest star on [[NPR]] Radio's Snap Judgement and told a story about the band traveling through Yellowstone National Park and running into \"trouble\". In June 2011 Red Wanting Blue was presented with the Key to the City from the mayor of Kearney, Nebraska.\n\n===''From The Vanishing Point'' (2011\u20132014)===\n[[File:Red Wanting Blue band, 2012.jpg|thumb|Red Wanting Blue, 2012. Photo by Jason Tanaka Blaney]]\nIn early 2011, the band headed into the studio to begin recording their second official label release (RWB's 9th album). Once again, the band enlisted the talents of Jamie Candiloro to produce the album. The title of the album was released on August 5, 2011, through social media outlets. ''From the Vanishing Point'' was originally slated for release in the fall of 2011, but the album release was pushed back to January 2012.<ref name=\"PittPost Gazette06072012\" /> In the weeks before its release ''From the Vanishing Point'' was streamed over 80,000 times in the month of October alone. Over 150,000 streams of the album were recorded by the turn of 2012. \"From the Vanishing Point\" landed at ''#10 on The ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Chart'' in its first official week of release.<ref name=\"Heatseekers 2012\" /> The singles \"Audition,\" \"Stay on the Bright Side\" and \"White Snow\" were released on [[Adult Album Alternative]] radio also known as AAAradio or Triple-A. The music video for \"Audition\" was shot live, in one-take on October 13 at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus, OH. The intention was to introduce the authentic live energy of the band without including the \"Hollywood magic\" that is involved in most \"live-style\" music videos. In November 2011, Red Wanting Blue along with producer Jamie Candiloro headed back into the studio to record \"[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]\" as a holiday treat for their fans. The song found its way to the radio and was picked up as a holiday single. Music Choice Television also picked up the song as a holiday single.<ref name=\"music choice\">[http://www.rtbot.net/fanatic_records Fanatic Records Information, Videos, Pictures and News.]</ref>\n\nRWB's album release tour kicked off in January 2012 and consisted of several months of sold-out shows from Chicago to New York City and more. This time proved to be the band's most successful period of touring to date with concerts selling out weeks in advance. In the morning, before most tour stops, the band could be heard making special appearances on the local radio stations (most included an interview and two to three songs). Red Wanting Blue also performed on [[The Rock Boat]] in March as well as several shows with friends and fellow musicians [[Carbon Leaf]]. On June 29, 2012 RWB's live concert attendance record was broken in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Over 9,000 people attended the outdoor concert dubbed \"Red Wanting Blue - Rocking on the River\" in support of the band. On April 13, \"Unraveled\", the film that features RWB's \"Magic Man\", was released theatrically (later debuting on [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] on August 8.) On July 10, the band made available a free download of their concert from NYC venue City Winery.\n\nOn July 18, Red Wanting Blue made their network television debut on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]]<ref name=\"Tribune06072012\" /> performing the song \"Audition\" to an audience that roared and cheered along. On Sept 17th RWB performed their debut session on Daytrotter.com. On October 1, 2012, the band announced they would be performing and appearing live on [[VH1]]'s morning show \"Big Morning Buzz Live\" on October 16 at 10am alongside [[Bruno Mars]] and [[Jason Aldean]]. On November 5 Red Wanting Blue performed live on the [[NPR]] radio program [[Mountain Stage]] alongside [[Dr. Dog]] and [[The Mountain Goats]] at the Keith Albee Theater in West Virginia.\n\nIn early 2013, RWB headlined a tour of the west coast and continued to sell out shows throughout the Midwest and east coast. They also toured eastern Canada with [[The Trews]] and hit a major milestone by selling out [[The Bowery Ballroom]] in New York City. At ''The Bowery Ballroom'' on March 9, Red Wanting Blue announced that they would be heading back into the studio with producer/friend Jamie Candiloro throughout March and April 2013 to record their 10th album.\n\nThroughout March, April and May 2013, Red Wanting Blue returned to their recording studio (\"El Rancho Relaxo\" in Columbus, Ohio) with Jamie Candiloro to produce their tenth album. This had been the longest amount of time ever scheduled off the road (for the purpose of recording) in the band's career. In September, RWB announced their fall tour dates with longtime friend [[Will Hoge]]. Red Wanting Blue chose [[Swear and Shake]] to open several dates on this fall tour entitled \"The Dime Store Circus Tour\".\n\nIn February 2014 Red Wanting Blue officially sold out their first two-night stint at the House of Blues In Cleveland, Ohio. They performed their \"love songs\" on the February 14 concert in honor of Valentine's Day and performed their full rock and roll show on February 15. The band played several rare songs from their early albums during these concerts.\n\nOn February 22 the band set sail for their 3rd appearance on [[The Rock Boat]]. Red Wanting Blue played on the theatre and pool deck stages. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] was invited to perform at the \"Campfire Story Sessions\" where he performed solo with his ukulele and told the true stories behind the songs  \"Probably Nothing\", \"Jennifear\" and a never before performed song called \"Little America.\" Ken Block and Drew Copland (of [[Sister Hazel]]), Emerson Hart (of [[Tonic (band)|Tonic]]) and [[Edwin McCain]] sang harmony on \"Jennifear\" as Scott Terry expressed several times how honored he was to be in their company.\n\n===''Little America'' (2014 \u2013 2016)===\nOn July 1, 2014, Red Wanting Blue released their tenth studio album titled ''Little America''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Chart and No.&nbsp;31 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock Chart. The album was recorded in Columbus, Ohio and Los Angeles, California, produced by Jamie Candiloro and mastered by Greg Calbi at Sterling Sound in NYC. Guest appearances include [[Ed Kowalczyk]] (of [[Live (band)]]), Kerri Spieler (of [[Swear and Shake]]) and Tim Hanseroth (of [[Brandi Carlile]]). A music video was released for the single ''You Are My Las Vegas'' starring the band member's real-life mothers. In the video, the moms physically transform into their sons (beards and all) and perform the song in character.\n\nTo celebrate the release of ''Little America'', RWB hit the road with longtime friends [[The Alternate Routes]]. The ''Sounds Like Summer U.S. Tour'' started in July 2014. In November, 2014 ''RWB'' hit the road with New Orleans band [[The Revivalists]] for a tour of the east coast and midwest. On Dec 4, 2014, ''Red Wanting Blue'' performed a special concert at [[Trinity Cathedral (Cleveland, Ohio)|Trinity Cathedral]] in Cleveland, Ohio. The performance consisted of both acoustic and electric sets and was recorded for the Cathedral Concert Series for [[PBS]] (rumored to air in March 2015).\n\nIn January, 2015, the band set sail to perform on the floating music festival ''Cayamo'' that featured [[John Prine]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Brandi Carlile]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[The Lone Bellow]], and more. Directly after ''Cayamo'', the band boarded ''The Rock Boat XV'' for their fourth consecutive year. The band performed alongside hosts [[Sister Hazel]], [[Barenaked Ladies]], longtime friends [[Alternate Routes]], [[Will Hoge]], and more. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] hosted the popular Rock Boat Songwriter Sessions and performed two brand new songs titled \"Holy Rolling Thunder\" and \"No Place To Go But Down\".\n\n''RWB'' hit the road in the spring/summer of 2015 on a tour called \"Our Little America Tour\". The tour began in Northwest Canada and ended in Boston. During this time they shared the stage with friends [[The Trews]] and [[The Alternate Routes]]. They debuted two new songs during this tour titled \"High and Dry\" and \"Holy Rolling Thunder\".\n\n===''RWB20 Live at Lincoln Theater'' (since 2016)===\n\nThis live concert film was recorded live at the Lincoln Theater in [[Columbus, Ohio]] on October 14, 2016. The double disc ''RWB20'' film and album was released only two months later, on December 16, 2016. The film was directed by ''Jenna Pace'' and the album was produced by ''Greg Rahm''. The film's purpose was to celebrate the first 20 years of ''Red Wanting Blue''. The concert started with a brand new song and proceeded to go back in time, playing re-worked versions of songs dating back to 1996.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"3\"\n|-\n!

The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}} It reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA Victor record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13\u201315}} In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, \"especially on legal documents\".{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's Outstanding Young Men used Aaron.

Known as the \"'''King of Rock and Roll'''\", he is regarded as [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century]]. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a [[civil rights movement|transformative era in race relations]], brought both great success and [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley#Danger to American culture|initial controversy]].\n\nPresley was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]; his family relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when he was 13. His music career began there in 1954, at [[Sun Records]] with producer [[Sam Phillips]], who wanted to bring the sound of [[African-American music]] to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill Black]], was a pioneer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. In 1955, drummer [[D. J. Fontana]] joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and [[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who managed him for the rest of his life. Presley's first RCA Victor single, \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the US. Within a year, RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular [[rock and roll]]; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans<ref name=\":00\" /> led to him being widely considered a [[moral panic|threat]] to the moral well-being of [[White Americans|white American]] youth.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=55}}\n\nIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''. Drafted into [[Military career of Elvis Presley|military service in 1958]], he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley's most famous films included ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' (1957), ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' (1961), and ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. However, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his [[Graceland]] estate at the age of 42.\n\nPresley is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time, with sales estimated around 500&nbsp;million records worldwide.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=sales}} He was commercially successful in many genres, including [[Traditional pop|pop]], country, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, [[adult contemporary]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. He won three [[Grammy Awards]], received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] at age 36, and has been inducted into [[List of halls of fame inducting Elvis Presley|multiple music halls of fame]]. He holds several records, including the most [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and the most number-one singles by any act on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

I was very [[shyness|shy]] about it.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=23}}\n\nIn September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade. The following year, he began singing and playing his guitar at school. He was often teased as a \"trashy\" kid who played [[hillbilly music]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=23\u201326}} Presley was a devotee of [[Mississippi Slim (country singer)|Mississippi Slim]]'s radio show. He was described as \"crazy about music\" by Slim's younger brother, one of Presley's classmates.

By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=44, 46, 51}} He competed in Humes' Annual \"Minstrel\" Show in 1953, singing and playing \"[[Till I Waltz Again with You]]\", a recent hit for [[Teresa Brewer]]. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: <blockquote>I wasn't popular in school&nbsp;... I failed music\u2014only thing I ever failed.

He aimed to pay for studio time to record a two-sided [[acetate disc]]: \"[[My Happiness (popular song)|My Happiness]]\" and \"[[That's When Your Heartaches Begin]]\". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he \"sounded like\". Biographer [[Peter Guralnick]] argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=62\u201364}} In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun\u2014\"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\" and \"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\"\u2014but again nothing came of it.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=65}} Not long after, he failed an [[audition]] for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=77}} and another for the band of [[Eddie Bond]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=83}}\n{{Listen|type=speech|filename=That's All Right.ogg|title=\"That's All Right\" |description=Presley transformed not only the sound but the emotion of the song, turning what had been written as a \"lament for a lost love into a satisfied declaration of independence.\"{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=174}}}}\nPhillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=72}} In June, he acquired a demo recording by [[Jimmy Sweeney]] of a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist [[Scotty Moore|Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore]] and [[double bass|upright bass]] player [[Bill Black]], to work with Presley for a recording session.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=10\u201311}} The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's \"[[That's All Right]]\". Moore recalled, \"All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them.\" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=94\u201397}} Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey [[Dewey Phillips]] (no relation to Sam Phillips) played \"That's All Right\" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=43}} Listener interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100\u2013101}} During the next few days, the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song, [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\", again in a distinctive style and employing a [[jury rigging|jury-rigged]] [[Delay (audio effect)|echo effect]] that Sam Phillips dubbed \"slapback\". A single was pressed with \"That's All Right\" on the A-side and \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" on the reverse.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=102\u2013104}}\n\n==== Early live performances and RCA Victor contract ====\nThe trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=105, 139}} Later that month, they appeared at the [[Overton Park#Levitt Shell|Overton Park Shell]], with [[Slim Whitman]] headlining. Here Elvis pioneered \"[[Rubber legs|Rubber Legs]]\", his signature dance movement.{{sfn|Miller|2021}}{{sfn|Rodman|2013|p=151}} A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: His wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106, 108\u2013111}} Moore recalled, \"During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mic and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}\n\nSoon after, Moore and Black left their old band to play with Presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter [[Bob Neal (promoter)|Bob Neal]] became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue in Memphis. When Presley played, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house [[western swing]] band resumed.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=139}} Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, \"His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=119}} Amid these live performances, Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=117\u2013127, 131}} Presley made what would be his only appearance on [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on October 2; ''Opry'' manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was \"not bad\" but did not suit the program.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=128\u2013130}}{{sfn|Mason|2007|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n==== ''Louisiana Hayride'', radio commercial, and first television performances ====\nIn November 1954, Presley performed on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''\u2014the ''Opry''{{'}}s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. His nervous first set drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=127\u2013128, 135\u2013142}} Soon after the show, the ''Hayride'' engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8, he purchased a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] instrument for $175 ({{Inflation|US|175|1954|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) and his trio began playing in new locales, including [[Houston]], Texas, and [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], Arkansas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=152, 156, 182}} Presley made his first television appearance on the [[KSLA-TV]] broadcast of ''Louisiana Hayride''. Soon after, he failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on the [[CBS]] television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular ''Hayride'' appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167\u2013168}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6\u201312}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley - TV Radio Mirror, September 1956 01.jpg|thumb|230px|Presley performing with [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] in 1956]]\nIn January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of [[Colonel Tom Parker]], whom he considered the best promoter in the music business.

Some of the songs, like \"That's All Right\", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the \"R&B idiom of negro field jazz\"; others, like \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", were \"more in the country field\", \"but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=163}} This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because \"he sounded too much like a [[hillbilly]].\"{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=104}} The blend came to be known as \"rockabilly\". At the time, Presley was billed as \"The King of Western Bop\", \"The Hillbilly Cat\", and \"The Memphis Flash\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=53}}\n\nPresley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=45}} The group maintained an extensive touring schedule.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=29}} Neal recalled, \"It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys.

There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him.\"{{sfn|Rogers|1982|p=41}} The trio became a quartet when ''Hayride'' drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of [[Bill Haley]], whose \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=217\u2013219}}\n\nAt the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=31}} After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with [[RCA Victor]] on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28\u201329}}{{refn|Of the $40,000, $5,000 covered back royalties owed by Sun.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28\u201329}}|name=royalties|group=lower-alpha}} Presley, aged 20, was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract.{{sfn|Escott|1998|p=421}} Parker arranged with the owners of [[Hill & Range]] Publishing, [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley.

The program, produced in New York City, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dorsey]]. After his first appearance on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victor's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a [[cover song|cover]] of [[Carl Perkins]]' rockabilly anthem \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\". In February, Presley's \"[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget]]\", a Sun recording released the previous August, reached the top of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country chart]].{{sfn|Slaughter|Nixon|2004|p=21}} Neal's contract was terminated and Parker became Presley's manager.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=50, 54, 64}}\n\nRCA Victor released Presley's [[Elvis Presley (album)|self-titled debut album]] on March 23.

As described by Hilburn, these <blockquote>were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists&nbsp;... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.{{sfn|Hilburn|2005}}</blockquote> It became the first rock and roll album to top the ''Billboard'' chart, a position it held for ten weeks.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Chuck Berry]], cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, \"of Elvis having the time of his life on stage ''with a guitar in his hands'' played a crucial role in positioning the guitar&nbsp;... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.\"{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=28}}\n\n==== ''Milton Berle Show'' and \"Hound Dog\" ====\n[[File:Elvis signs autographs in Minneapolis 1956.jpg|thumb|left|Presley signing autographs in [[Minneapolis]] in 1956]]\nOn April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''.

The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the \"biggest pop craze\" since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]&nbsp; and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: <blockquote>As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed.&nbsp;...

Also known as ''Welcome Home Elvis'', the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=44, 62\u201363}}\n\n''[[G.I. Blues (album)|G.I.

His first LP of sacred material, ''[[His Hand in Mine]]'', followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for twenty-four local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 114}} A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, ''[[Something for Everybody]]''.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=148}} According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the [[Nashville sound]], the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley over the next half-decade, the album is largely \"a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis' birthright\".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=52}} It would be his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven years.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 119}}\n\n==== Lost in Hollywood ====\nParker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted [[musical comedy|musical comedies]]. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein\u2014''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960) and ''[[Wild in the Country]]'' (1961)\u2014were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=133}} His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a \"pantheon of bad taste\".{{sfn|Caine|2005|p=21}} Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. [[Hal Wallis]], who produced nine, declared, \"A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood.\"{{sfn|Fields|2007}}\n\nOf Presley's films in the 1960s, fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules\u2014Presley frequently starred in three a year\u2014affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: \"three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}} As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew \"progressively worse\".{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=67}} [[Julie Parrish]], who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'' (1966), says that Presley disliked many of the songs.{{sfn|Lisanti|2000|pp=19, 136}} The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone: \"The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=201}} Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]]. But by and large, according to biographer [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]], the numbers seemed to be \"written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=32}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley and Priscilla with Lisa Marie February 1968.jpg|thumb|274x274px|Presley and his wife, [[Priscilla Presley]], holding their newborn daughter, [[Lisa Marie Presley]], in 1968]]\nIn the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as \"[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]\" (1961) and \"[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]\" (1962). However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: \"[[Crying in the Chapel]]\" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967). It won him his first [[Grammy Award]], for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was \"arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs\".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=650}}\n\nShortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the [[Aladdin (hotel and casino)|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=261\u2013263}} The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks continued. It was not until October 1967, when the [[Clambake (soundtrack)|''Clambake'' soundtrack LP]] registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA Victor executives recognized a problem. \"By then, of course, the damage had been done\", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. \"Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans.\"{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=73}}\n\n=== 1968\u20131973: Comeback ===\n==== ''Elvis'': the '68 Comeback Special ====\n{{Main|Singer Presents...Elvis}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley 68 Comeback Special.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Presley, wearing a tight black leather jacket with Napoleonic standing collar, black leather wristbands, and black leather pants, holds a microphone with a long cord.

Parker had already shifted his plans to television: he maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=4}}\n\nRecorded in late June in [[Burbank, California]], the special, simply called ''Elvis'', aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience\u2014Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer [[Steve Binder]] worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=293, 296}} The show, NBC's highest-rated that season, captured forty-two percent of the total viewing audience.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} [[Jon Landau]] of ''Eye'' magazine remarked: <blockquote>There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made [[Jim Morrison]] green with envy.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}}</blockquote> Marsh calls the performance one of \"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=649}}\n\nBy January 1969, the single \"[[If I Can Dream]]\", written for the special, reached number 12. The [[NBC-TV Special|soundtrack album]] rose into the top ten. According to friend [[Jerry Schilling]], the special reminded Presley of what \"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.&nbsp;... He was out of prison, man.\"{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} Binder said of Presley's reaction, \"I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life.

Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is \"a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=396}} The album featured the hit single \"[[In the Ghetto]]\", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart\u2014Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since \"Bossa Nova Baby\" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\", \"[[Don't Cry Daddy]]\", and \"[[Kentucky Rain]]\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=419}}\n\nPresley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the ''Comeback Special'', offers came in from around the world. The [[London Palladium]] offered Parker {{US$|28,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|28000|1969|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) for a one-week engagement. He responded, \"That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?\"{{sfn|Gordon|2005|p=146}} In May, the brand-new [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, booked Presley for fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist [[James Burton]] and including two gospel groups, [[The Imperials]] and [[Sweet Inspirations]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=283}} Costume designer [[Bill Belew]], responsible for the intense leather styling of the ''Comeback Special'', created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by his passion for karate.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=343}} Nonetheless, Presley was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker oversaw a major promotional push, and International Hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]] arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=346\u2013347}}\n\nPresley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" (which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life).{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=149\u2013150}} At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as \"The King\", Presley gestured toward [[Fats Domino]], who was taking in the scene. \"No,\" Presley said, \"that's the real king of rock and roll.\"{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=259, 262}} ''[[Newsweek]]'' commented, \"There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.\"{{sfn|Moyer|2002|p=73}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Presley \"supernatural, his own resurrection.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=287}} In November, Presley's final non-concert film, ''[[Change of Habit]]'', opened. The double album ''[[From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis]]'' came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. \"Suspicious Minds\" reached the top of the charts\u2014Presley's first [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. pop number-one]] in over seven years, and his last.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|pp=521\u2013522}}\n\n[[Cassandra Peterson]], later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless {{US$|50,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|50000|1970|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=253}} The FBI took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows.

As music historian John Robertson noted, <blockquote>The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop\u2014perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=70}}</blockquote> After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the [[Southern United States|South]], his first since 1958.

Twice during the year he overdosed on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. In late 1973, he was hospitalized from the effects of a [[pethidine]] addiction. According to his primary care physician, [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley \"felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street\".{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=238}} Despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=481, 487, 499, 504, 519\u2013520}}\n\nPresley's condition declined precipitously that September.

The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered \"[[anaphylactic shock]] brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy\". Lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that [[polypharmacy]] was the primary cause of death; one reported \"fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=651\u2013653}} In 1979, forensic pathologist [[Cyril Wecht]] reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of [[depressant]]s had resulted in Presley's accidental death.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Forensic historian and pathologist [[Michael Baden]] viewed the situation as complicated: \"Elvis had  an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] for a long time.

It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}\n\nIn 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as [[Miami-Dade County]] coroner,{{sfn|Tennant|2013|p=2}} declared at its completion, \"There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack.\"{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff \"could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then.\"{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=11\u201314}} One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, <blockquote>could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached.&nbsp;... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body&nbsp;... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with [[diabetes]], glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs.

Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=211}} and, as Stoller put it, \"He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.\"{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, \"I know practically every religious song that's ever been written.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}}\n\n=== Musicianship ===\nPresley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear.{{sfn|Graceland Blog|2015}} Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA Victor albums.

In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP ''[[Peace in the Valley (EP)|Peace in the Valley]]''. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=14}} Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Run On.ogg|title=\"Run On\" |description=From ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967), a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition.

His first post-Army single, the number-one hit \"Stuck on You\", is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its \"mild rock beat\"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it \"upbeat pop\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=123}} The number five \"[[She's Not You]]\" (1962) \"integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop\".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}} The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on ''Elvis Is Back!'' was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966\u201367 recordings as \"[[Down in the Alley (The Clovers song)|Down in the Alley]]\" and \"[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=213, 237}} Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", a number-one in 1960. \"It's Now or Never\", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song \"{{lang|nap|[['O sole mio]]|italic=no}}\" and concluding with a \"full-voiced operatic cadence\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=65}} These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\nWhile Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become \"hard to find\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=343}} A significant exception was \"Burning Love\", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and [[funk]]. Much of ''Elvis in Memphis'', as well as \"Suspicious Minds\", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=199}}\n\n=== Vocal style and range ===\n[[File:Elvis Presley first national television appearance 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Publicity photo of Elvis playing guitar|Publicity photo for the [[CBS]] program ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage Show]]'', January 16, 1956]]\n\nThe developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from \"high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=234}} Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the \"vocal stutter\" on 1955's \"[[Baby Let's Play House]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=317}} When on \"Don't Be Cruel\", Presley \"slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses,\" he shows \"how masterful his relaxed style really is.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=91}} Marsh describes the vocal performance on \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" as one of \"gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing\", with the line {{\"'}}Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=490}}\n\nJorgensen calls the 1966 recording of \"How Great Thou Art\" \"an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions\", as Presley \"crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax\", becoming \"a kind of one-man quartet\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=212}} Guralnick finds \"[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand by Me]]\" from the same gospel sessions \"a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance\", but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on \"Where No One Stands Alone\", resorting \"to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound\" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, \"he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=232}} Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: \"The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=231}}\n\nMarsh praises his 1968 reading of \"[[U.S. Male]]\", \"bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=424}} The performance on \"In the Ghetto\" is, according to Jorgensen, \"devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms\", instead relying on the exceptional \"clarity and sensitivity of his voice\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=271}} Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of \"almost translucent eloquence&nbsp;... so quietly confident in its simplicity\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=332}} On \"Suspicious Minds\", Guralnick hears essentially the same \"remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise\", but supplemented with \"an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=335}}\n\nMusic critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] observes that \"Presley has been described variously as a [[baritone]] and a [[tenor]]. An extraordinary compass&nbsp;... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion.\"{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two [[octave]]s and a third, \"from the baritone low [[G (musical note)|G]] to the tenor high [[B (musical note)|B]], with an upward extension in [[falsetto]] to at least a D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down.\"{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} In Pleasants' view, his voice was \"variable and unpredictable\" at the bottom, \"often brilliant\" at the top, with the capacity for \"full-voiced high Gs and [[A (musical note)|As]] that an opera baritone might envy\".{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that \"his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all.\"{{sfn|Waters|2003|p=205}} Presley was always \"able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers\", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}\n\n== Public image ==\n=== Relationship with the African-American community ===\n[[File:BillyWard n Elvis Presley circa 1955.jpg|thumb|Elvis Presley and [[Billy Ward (singer)|Billy Ward]], circa 1955]]\nWhen Dewey Phillips first aired \"That's All Right\" on Memphis' [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]], many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100\u2013101}} From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician [[Arthur Crudup]]\u2014the originator of \"That's All Right\"\u2014\"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} ''The Memphis World'', an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley \"cracked Memphis' segregation laws\" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its \"colored night\".{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} In contrast, many white adults \"did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.\"<ref name=\":00\" />\n\nDespite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had announced, \"The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes.\" A journalist with the national African American weekly ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'', Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of ''Jailhouse Rock'', Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: <blockquote>I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it.&nbsp;... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that.{{sfn|Williams|2012}}</blockquote> Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Blues singer [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland, reported of Presley, \"He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=426}} Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}}\n\nThe persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music still found adherents.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ushe |first1=Naledi |title=Appropriation or appreciation?

Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, \"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that.

But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force.&nbsp;... Elvis' breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.{{sfn|New York Times|2002}}</blockquote>\n\nHe was ranked third on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of greatest artists. [[Bono]] wrote in appreciation: <blockquote>In Elvis, you have the blueprint for rock & roll. The highness \u2014 the gospel highs. The mud \u2014 the Delta mud, the blues. Sexual liberation. Controversy. Changing the way people feel about the world. It's all there with Elvis.{{sfn|Bono|2010|loc=\"Elvis\"}}</blockquote>\n\n Not only Presley's achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:<blockquote>Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.&nbsp;... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.&nbsp;... Elvis has emerged as a great ''artist'', a great ''rocker'', a great ''purveyor of schlock'', a great ''heart throb'', a great ''bore'', a great ''symbol of potency'', a great ''ham'', a great ''nice person'', and, yes, a great American.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=141\u2013142}}</blockquote>\n\n== Achievements ==\nHaving sold about 500 million records worldwide, Presley is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=sales|The estimates of Elvis Presley's record sales vary from 500 million \u2013 1 billion records worldwide.{{sfn|Reuters|2022}}<ref>{{cite book|title= Brandstorm: Surviving and Thriving in the New Consumer-Led Marketplace|publisher=[[ Macmillan Publishers]]|page=77|author=Liz Nickles, Savita Iyer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/14/us/elvis-presley-1968-comeback-guitar-auction/index.html|title= An iconic guitar from Elvis Presley's Comeback Special is up for auction|date=14 March 2021|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>}} Presley's rankings for top ten and number-one hits vary depending on how the double-sided \"Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel\" and \"Don't/I Beg of You\" singles, which precede the inception of ''Billboard''{{'}}s unified [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, are analyzed.{{refn|Whitburn follows actual ''Billboard'' history in considering the four songs on the \"Don't Be Cruel/Hound Dog\" and \"Don't/I Beg of You\" singles as distinct.

''Billboard'' now considers both singles as unified items, ignoring the historical sales split of the former and its old Top 100 chart entirely. Whitburn thus analyzes the four songs as yielding three number ones and a total of four top tens.

Nicknamed \"'''The Killer'''\", he was described as \"[[rock 'n' roll]]'s first great wild man\". A pioneer of rock and roll and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studio in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. \"[[Crazy Arms]]\" sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but it was his 1957 hit \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\" that shot Lewis to worldwide fame. He followed this with the major hits \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", \"[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]\", and \"[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]\".\n\nHis rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old first cousin once removed. His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into [[country music]] and had hits with songs such as \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country and Western Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Myers |first=Marc |date=October 24, 2014 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis, the Enduring Rebel of Rock 'n' Roll |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |website=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=March 8, 2017 |archive-date=March 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321082649/https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |url-status=live }}</ref> His No. 1 country hits included \"[[To Make Love Sweeter for You]]\", \"[[There Must Be More to Love Than This (song)|There Must Be More to Love Than This]]\", \"[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]\", and \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\".\n\nLewis's successes continued throughout the decades, and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of [[The Big Bopper]]'s \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" and [[Mack Vickery]]'s \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continued to tour worldwide and released new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was his best-selling release, with over a million copies worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, another of his bestselling albums.\n\nLewis had a dozen [[Music recording certification|gold records]] in rock and country. He won four Grammy awards, including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and two [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Awards. Lewis was inducted into the inaugural class of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre was recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memphis Music Hall of Fame |url=http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |access-date=October 12, 2016 |website=Memphismusichalloffame.com |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009220210/http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2022.

He grew up in an impoverished farming family in Eastern Louisiana. In his youth, he began playing the piano with two of his cousins, [[Mickey Gilley]] (later a popular country music singer) and [[Jimmy Swaggart]] (later a popular televangelist). His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, [[Carl McVoy]] (who later recorded with [[Bill Black]]'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney's Big House, a black [[juke joint]] across the tracks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 16, 2004 |title=Natchez Under The Hill Saloon \u2013 Natchez Mississippi |url=http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716210854/http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |archive-date=July 16, 2004 |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Underthehillsaloon.com}}</ref> On November 19, 1949, Lewis made his first public performance of his career, playing with a [[country and western]] band at a car dealership in Ferriday.

When Lewis daringly played a [[boogie-woogie]] rendition of \"My God Is Real\" at a church assembly, it ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some \"worldly\" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them.

In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for other Sun artists, including [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's \"[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]\", \"[[Your True Love]]\", and \"Put Your Cat Clothes On\" and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s \"Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll\".\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano.

In 2005, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]].

The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, \"Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless centre of the very best rock & roll...\" The album showcases Lewis's skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that \"''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg'' is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion.\"\n\n===Country comeback===\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Carl Perkins]] on ''The Johnny Cash Christmas Special'' in November 1977]]\nFrustrated by Smash's inability to score a hit, Lewis was planning on leaving the label when promotions manager [[Eddie Kilroy]] pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the [[Jerry Chesnut]] song \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing [[Iago]] in a rock and roll adaptation of ''Othello'' called ''Catch My Soul'' in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer [[Jerry Kennedy]]. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have predicted, although country music always remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation ''Killer Country'', the conversion to country music in 1968 \"looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by countless country records starting with his first, '[[Crazy Arms]]', in 1956.\" The last time Lewis had had a song on the country charts was with \"Pen and Paper\" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but \"Another Place, Another Time\" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart-toppers. Hits include \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)\", \"To Make Love Sweeter For You\", \"She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)\", \"Since I Met You Baby\", \"Once More With Feeling\", \"One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)\", and \"Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough\". The production on his early country albums, such as ''[[Another Place, Another Time (album)|Another Place, Another Time]]'' and ''She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye'', was sparse, quite different from the slick \"[[Nashville sound]]\" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as [[George Jones]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. In his book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording \"were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio\".\n\nIn a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer [[Shelby Singleton]], who purchased [[Sun Records]] from [[Sam Phillips]] in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his later unreleased Sun recordings, \"[[One Minute Past Eternity]]\", was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] hit \"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye\". Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following ''The Golden Cream of the Country'' with ''[[A Taste of Country]]'' later in 1970.\n\n===Grand Ole Opry appearance===\nLewis played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] only once, on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to ''A Half Century of Hits'', he had maintained an ambivalence to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Music City]] ever since he was turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at [[Sun Records]]: \"It was 18 years since he had left [[Nashville]] broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn't move there and didn't [[schmooze]] there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different.\"<ref name=\"Escott\"/>\n\nAs recounted in a 2015 online ''Rolling Stone'' article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\". Ignoring his allotted time constraints\u2014and, thus, commercial breaks\u2014Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited [[Del Wood]]\u2014the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager\u2014out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\", \"Workin' Man Blues\", \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\", and a number of other classics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dunkerly, Beville |date=January 20, 2015 |title=Flashback: Jerry Lee Lewis Drops an F-Bomb on the Grand Ole Opry |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |access-date=September 30, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-date=October 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021172629/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===''The Session'' and ''Southern Roots''===\n[[File:JerryLee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis performing in 1977]]\nLewis returned to the pop charts with \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\" in 1971 and \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" in 1972, and this, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage [[rock and roll]], inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of British and Irish musicians, including [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Kenney Jones]], and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut \"Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" was the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. ''The Session'' was his highest pop charting album since 1964's ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that year, he went to Memphis and recorded ''[[Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis]]'', a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. According to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, \"the Killer\" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to record: \"During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog.\" During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue ''Southern Roots: The Original Sessions'', Meaux asks Lewis, \"Do you wanna try one?\", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, \"If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Little |first=Michael H. |date=September 29, 2020 |title=Graded on a Curve: Jerry Lee Lewis, Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis |url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |access-date=March 22, 2021 |website=The Vinyl District |archive-date=January 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115110247/http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was \"Middle Age Crazy\", which made it to number 4 in 1977.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis @ Credicard Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Lewis performing in 2009]]\nIn 1979, Lewis switched record labels to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and produced the critically acclaimed ''Jerry Lee Lewis'', although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was incorporated into all future events. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''.\n\nIn 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called \"It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)\" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on the radio. The public downfall of his cousin, [[televangelist]] [[Jimmy Swaggart]] around the same time, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts.

Lewis had a recorded argument with [[Sam Phillips]] during the recording session for \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous (\"How can... How can the devil save souls? What are you ''talkin' about''?\" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous [[Million Dollar Quartet]] jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer [[Rick Bragg]] explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because \"only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the [[Assemblies of God|Assembly of God]]\", and {{\"'}}Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words... they was [[Baptists]]', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bragg |first=Rick |author-link=Rick Bragg |date=October\u2013November 2014 |title=Jerry Lee and Me |url=http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |url-status=dead |journal=[[Garden & Gun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073447/http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |archive-date=November 21, 2015 |access-date=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990 documentary ''The Jerry Lee Lewis Story'', Lewis said to the interviewer, \"The Bible doesn't even speak of religion.

I find myself falling short of the glory of God.\"\n\nGospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire.

Later that night, Lewis was at a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] nightclub called the Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new [[Lincoln Continental]] with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.\n\nPresley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but \"Elvis, watching on the [[closed-circuit television]], told guards to call the police. The [[Memphis police]] found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs.\" Lewis said, \"The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me \u2013 knowin' me the way he did \u2013 was ridiculous.\" Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world.

He has made numerous recordings, primarily in the [[rockabilly]] genre but also has a large body of recorded work in [[rock 'n' roll]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]], and [[country music]]. He performed live primarily in the [[Washington, D.C.]], area, but also played regularly at European roots music festivals.\n\n==Early life==\nHancock was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and raised in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], where he has lived most of his life.  He attended George Washington High School in Alexandria, graduating in 1964. He came from a musical family. His maternal grandmother Katie sang with Minstrel shows in black face accompanying herself on piano and harmonica. Two of his aunts Eileen and Anita were a singing duo in the 1940s who sang at two or three Washington DC radios stations on a regular basis. His paternal grandfather Mitchell (Mitch) Hancock played mandolin from about 1897 until 1902. He often played on River Boats in New Orleans and recorded for the Edison Label. Billy's father worked for the Southern Railway and his mother worked for Waxie Maxie's, a local record store chain, and other record stores. The records his mother brought home from work, primarily rhythm and blues from the late 1940s, played a large and influential role in his musical development.\n\n==Career==\nHancock began his career playing in bands around Washington, D.C., while still a teenager. After graduating from high school, he played with bands in [[Rhode Island]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] before returning to the Washington area. In 1968, he moved to [[Baltimore]] to attend the [[Peabody Conservatory]], and continued to play in bands in the Baltimore area.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hancock began a collaboration with [[Danny Gatton]] and they formed Danny and the Fat Boys with Hancock (bass, vocals), Gatton (guitars), and Dave Elliott (drums, vocals). In 1975, the group released ''American Music'' on a label owned by Hancock and his brother. The album's title was taken from a rhythm and blues song Hancock had written. It was later re-issued on CD.\n\nIn 1978, Hancock recorded four rockabilly songs under the name Billy Hancock and the Tennessee Rockets for [[Ripsaw Records]], a small independent label. He continued to record rockabilly for Ripsaw under that name for two years. Ripsaw released four singles during that time and licensed those and other titles to larger labels both in the U.S. and France. It is these rockabilly recordings for which Hancock is known internationally.\n\nIn 1983, Hancock recorded another rockabilly record, \"Hey! Little Rock And Roller\", that was released in France on the Big Beat Label. Later that year, he returned to Ripsaw to record various rock and roll songs, six of which Ripsaw released in 1985. All of the Ripsaw material was later released on CDs by Finnish Bluelight Records.\n\nThroughout his career, Hancock played in backing bands for prominent musicians, including [[Fats Domino]], [[Gene Vincent]], blues guitarist [[Roy Buchanan]], rockabilly [[Charlie Feathers]], [[the Clovers]], [[Amos Milburn]], and country musicians [[Dottie West]] and [[Jean Shepard]]. He co-produced and played guitar on [[Tex Rubinowitz]]'s rockabilly song \"Hot Rod Man.\"\n\nIn 2002, Hancock and his brother the television director, Dale Hancock founded Turkey Mountain Records, an independent record label. The label was formed to find and promote talented artists of all genres who, for whatever reasons, have been ignored by other record labels. Their Archival Series re-released material on artists of the past whose works have been unavailable until now. Turkey Mountain Records' roster of artists included: Danny Gatton, The British Walkers (featuring Roy Buchanan), Bobbie (The Kid) Howard with Link Wray and The Ray Men, Charlie Feathers, The Fallen Angels, and Billy Hancock himself.\n\nIn 2005, the [[Washington Area Music Association]] WAMA awarded Hancock a Special Recognition Award for his 40-plus years as a vocalist, musician, songwriter, producer, promoter, and label owner. In 2006, WAMA presented him with two \"Wammie\" awards for 2005 Roots Rock Vocalist and Roots Rock Recording.  In 2012, WAMA presented Hancock as one of \"The Fallen Angels\" a special recognition award.\n\nIn 2010, Hancock was inducted into the Southern Legends Hall of Fame. He is already a member of three other International Halls of Fame.\n\nHancock was also the television host for ''American Music'' in Arlington, Virginia, where he interviewed and showcased songwriters and a music historian.\n\nHe was also a member of the resurrected art rock group from the sixties, The Fallen Angels.\n\nOn 4 November 2012 Hancock was inducted into The Northern Virginia Blues Society, Blues Hall of Fame in Manassas, Va.\n\n==Discography==\n*1975 - ''American Music''\n*1981 - ''Rockabilly Fever''\n*1981 - ''Shakin' That Rockabilly Fever''\n*1983 - ''Hey!

His songs, such as \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\", \"[[Summertime Blues]]\", \"[[C'mon Everybody]]\" and \"[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]\", captured teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s and early 1960s.<ref name=\"RRHOF\">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Eddie Cochran: Hall of Fame Essay|work=Inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|location=Cleveland, Ohio|year=1987|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/eddie-cochran/|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Cochran experimented with [[multitrack recording]], distortion techniques, and [[overdubbing]], even on his earliest singles.<ref name=Cochran2003>{{cite book|last1=Cochran|first1=Bobby|author-link=Bobby Cochran|last2=Van Hecke|first2=Susan|title=Three Steps to Heaven: The Eddie Cochran Story|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|year=2003|isbn=978-0634032523}}</ref> Cochran played the guitar, piano, bass, and drums.<ref name=RRHOF/> His image as a sharply dressed and attractive young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the 1950s rocker, and in death, Cochran achieved iconic status.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Eddie Cochran Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2020|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-cochran-mn0000793988/biography|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCochran was involved with music from an early age, playing in the school band and teaching himself to play blues guitar.<ref name=Cochran2003/> In 1955, Cochran formed a duo with the guitarist [[Hank Cochran]] (no relation) and became known as the Cochran Brothers. When they split the following year, Eddie began a song-writing career with [[Jerry Capehart]]. His first success came when he performed the song \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" in the film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'', starring [[Jayne Mansfield]]. Soon afterward, he signed a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] and his first record for the label, \"[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]\", rose to number 18 on the [[Billboard charts]].\n\nCochran died at the age of 21 in St Martin's Hospital, [[Bath, Somerset]], after a car accident in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]], at the end of his British tour with [[Gene Vincent]] in April 1960.  On April 16, after they had just performed at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]], on their way to their next venue, Vincent, Cochran and the songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]] were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi. The other two passengers survived with major injuries, but Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day.\n\nThough Cochran's best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. His songs have been recorded by a wide variety of recording artists. [[Paul McCartney]] himself chose Cochran's \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" as his audition piece, assured to impress [[John Lennon]] by his performance of it, which he did and was hired as a member of Lennon's [[skiffle]] group [[The Quarrymen]], which later was renamed [[The Beatles]].\n\n==Early life==\nCochran was born on October 3, 1938, in [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]], to Alice and Frank R. Cochran. He was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.<ref name=\"Cochran2003\" /> Cochran's parents were from Oklahoma. Cochran took music lessons in school but quit the band to play drums. Additionally, rather than taking piano lessons, he began learning guitar, playing country and other music he heard on the radio.\n\nIn 1952, Cochran's family moved to [[Bell Gardens, California]]. As his guitar playing improved, Cochran formed a band with two friends from his junior high school. In January 1955, Cochran dropped out of [[Bell Gardens High School]] in his first year to become a professional musician.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web |year=2020 |title=Eddie Cochran Biography |url=https://www.gretschguitars.com/features/eddie-cochran |access-date=April 14, 2020 |work=Featured Pages |publisher=Gretsch Guitars |location=Savannah, Georgia}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n=== The Cochran Brothers (1955\u20131956) ===\n[[File:The Cochran Brothers.jpg|thumb|The Cochran Brothers]]\nDuring a show featuring many performers at an [[American Legion]] hall, Cochran met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter.

In the spring of 1956, [[Boris Petroff]] asked Cochran if he would appear in the musical comedy film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956). Cochran agreed and performed the song \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" in the movie. In 1957, Cochran starred in his second film, ''[[Untamed Youth]]'' (1957), and had yet another hit, \"[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]\", one of the few songs he recorded that was written by other songwriters (in this case [[John D. Loudermilk]]). \"Twenty Flight Rock\" was written by AMI staff writer [[Ned Fairchild]] (a pen name\u2014her real name is Nelda Fairchild). Fairchild, who was not a rock and roll performer, merely provided the initial form of the song; the co-writing credit reflects Cochran's major changes and contributions to the final product.\n\n==== ''Singin' to My Baby'' (1957) ====\nIn the summer of 1957, [[Liberty Records]] issued Cochran's only studio album released during his lifetime, ''[[Singin' to My Baby]]''. The album included John D. Loudermilk's \"Sittin' in the Balcony\". For the album, Cochran worked with manager and songwriter [[Jerry Capehart]], and wrote the songs \"Completely Sweet\", \"Undying Love\", \"When I'm Mad\", and Cochran original \"One Kiss\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=1957 |title=Eddie Cochran With The Johnny Mann Orchestra And Chorus \u2013 Singin' To My Baby |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/290087-Eddie-Cochran-With-The-Johnny-Mann-Orchestra-And-Chorus-Singin-To-My-Baby |access-date=May 25, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Cochran seemed to find his stride in the famous teenage anthem \"[[Summertime Blues]]\" (co-written with Jerry Capehart). With this song, Cochran was established as one of the most important influences on rock and roll in the 1950s, both lyrically and musically. The song, released by [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] recording no. 55144, charted at number&nbsp;8 in 1958.\n\nOriginally, Cochran toured with [[The Kelly Four]] as his backing band, guitarist [[Mike Deasy]], saxophonist Mike Henderson, bassist [[Dave Shriver]], and drummer [[Gene Riggio]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Kelly Four Discography {{!}} Discogs |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2874069-The-Kelly-Four |access-date=May 27, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref> They were known as The Hollywood Swingers, a reference to [[Dick D'Agostin]]'s band. The line-up of Cochran's touring band would change overtime, with saxophonist [[Seals and Crofts|Jim Seals]] and bassist [[Connie 'Guybo' Smith]], and the addition of pianist [[Jim Stivers]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jimmy Seals session with Eddie Cochran |url=http://thompsonian.info/sealsec.html |access-date=2024-05-27 |website=thompsonian.info}}</ref> They were eventually joined by various members from Dick D'Agostin and The Swingers. In 1959, The Swingers line-up became [[Multi-instrumentalist|muti-instrumentalist]] with pianist Dick D'Agostin, pianist Jim Stivers (briefly on bass), guitarist [[Larry D'Agostin]], saxophonist [[Paul Kaufman]], and drummer Gene Riggio. However, D'Agostin left and was called-up to enlist into the U.S. Army. Members from The Kelly Four returned, Deasy and Henderson, with Stivers and Riggio being accompanied by bassist Don Meyer (later replaced by Dave Shriver). This was the last line-up of Cochran's touring band, returning to the name of The Kelly Four.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[File:C'mon, Everybody - Billboard ad 1958.jpg|thumb|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, December 15, 1958]]\n\nCochran starred in his last film ''[[Go, Johnny, Go!]]'' (1959).<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051665/ |title=Go, Johnny, Go!

The band was also known as '''Bill Haley and the Comets''' and '''Bill Haley's Comets'''. From late 1954 to late 1956, the group recorded nine Top 20 singles, one of which was number one and three that were Top Ten. The single \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" was the best-selling rock single in the history of the genre and maintained that position for several years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bogdanov|first1=Vladimir|last2=Woodstra|first2=Chris|last3=Erlewine|first3=Stephen Tomas|date=2003|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music|location=|publisher=Backbeat Books|page=315|isbn=0-87930-760-9}}</ref>\n\nBand leader [[Bill Haley]] had previously been a [[Western swing]] performer; after recording a [[rockabilly]] version of [[Ike Turner]] and his [[Kings of Rhythm]]'s \"[[Rocket 88]]\", one of the first rock and roll recordings, Haley changed his band's musical direction to rock music. They went on to record hit versions of \"[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]\", \"[[Shake, Rattle & Roll]]\", the aforementioned \"Rock Around the Clock\", \"Dim, Dim the Lights\", \"[[Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie]]\", \"Razzle-Dazzle\", \"[[See You Later, Alligator]]\", \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In|The Saints Rock 'N' Roll]]\" and \"[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]\". In 1956, the group appeared in two early rock and roll movies with disc jockey [[Alan Freed]]: ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]''.\n\nThough the group was considered to be at the forefront of rock and roll during the genre's formative years, the arrival of more risqu\u00e9 acts such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Little Richard]] by 1956 led the more clean-cut Haley and his Comets to decline in popularity. Haley would remain popular in [[Europe]] and go on to have a comeback as a nostalgia act in the 1970s, along with many of his contemporaries. Following Haley's death, no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the Comets name, all claiming (with varying degrees of authority) to be the continuation of Haley's group. As of the end of 2014, four such groups were still performing in the United States and internationally.\n\n==Early history==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Comets Ed Sullivan 1955.jpg|thumb|Bill Haley and the Comets on the Ed Sullivan Show or Toast of the Town, Sunday, August 7, 1955, CBS, Hartford, Connecticut]] -->\nIn around the mid-1940s, Bill Haley performed with the Down Homers and formed a group called the Four Aces of Western Swing. The group that later became the Comets initially formed as \"Bill Haley and the Saddlemen\" {{Circa|1949}}\u20131952, and performed mostly country and western songs, though occasionally with a bluesy feel.

It sold well and was followed in 1952 by a cover of a 1940s [[rhythm and blues]] song called \"[[Rock the Joint]]\" for Holiday's sister company, [[Essex Records]].\n\nDuring those years however, Haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in America. Many Saddlemen recordings were not released until the 1970s and 1980s, and highlights included romantic ballads such as \"Rose of My Heart\" and [[western swing]] tunes such as \"Yodel Your Blues Away.\" The original members of this group were Haley, pianist and accordion player [[Johnny Grande]] and [[steel guitar]]ist [[Billy Williamson (guitarist)|Billy Williamson]]. Al Thompson was the group's first bass player, followed by [[Al Rex]] and [[Marshall Lytle]]. During the group's early years, it recorded under several other names, including Johnny Clifton and His String Band and [[Reno Browne]] and Her Buckaroos (although Browne, a female matinee idol of the time, did not actually appear on the record).\n\n\"Rocket 88\", \"Rock the Joint\", and their immediate follow-ups were released under the increasingly incongruous Saddlemen name. It soon became apparent that a new name for the group was needed to fit the new musical style. A friend of Haley's, making note of the common mispronunciation of the name [[Halley's Comet]] to rhyme with ''Bailey'', suggested that Haley call his band the Comets. This event is cited in the Haley biographies ''Sound and Glory'' by John Haley and John von Hoelle; ''Bill Haley'' by John Swenson; and in ''Still Rockin' Around the Clock'', a memoir by Comets bass player Marshall Lytle.\n\nThe new name for the group was adopted in the fall of 1952, before the 1953 release of \"[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]\" which had some elements of [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]] music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/2135591-Bill-Haley-With-Haleys-Comets-Crazy-Man-Crazy|title=Bill Haley With Haley's Comets* \u2013 Crazy Man, Crazy|date=July 6, 2017|work=Discogs|access-date=November 10, 2023|quote=}}</ref> Members of the group at that time were Haley, Johnny Grande, Billy Williamson and Marshall Lytle. Grande usually played piano on records but switched to accordion for live shows as it was more portable than a piano and easier to deal with during musical numbers that involved a lot of dancing around.

Soon after, Haley asked Richards again, who then accepted the role. During this time (and as late as the fall of 1955), Haley did not have a permanent lead guitar player, choosing to use session musicians on records and either playing lead guitar himself or having Williamson play steel solos.\n\nEven before the release of more successful records, the group had achieved greatness in some respects: \"No one had blended country and R&B on a single before the Comets' \"Rock the Joint\". No one had scored an American Top 20 hit with anything that could really qualify as rock'n'roll before their single \"Crazy Man Crazy\" in 1953\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/22/bill-haley-rock-around-the-clock-worlds-first-rock-anthem|title=Bill Haley: Rock Around the Clock \u2013 the world's first rock anthem|date=May 22, 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==National success and \"Rock Around the Clock\"==\n[[File:BillHaleyHankSnowTicket.jpg|thumb|Bill Haley/Elvis/Hank Snow Ticket \u2013 Oklahoma City newspaper ad. for Sunday October 16, 1955; two shows at the Municipal Auditorium.

[[Elvis Presley]] recorded the song in 1956, combining Haley's arrangement with Turner's original lyrics, but his version was not a substantial hit. Late in 1954, Haley recorded another hit, \"Dim, Dim The Lights\", which was one of the first R&B songs recorded by a white group to cross over to the R&B charts. [[Johnnie Ray]] had reached Number 1 with \"[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]\" in 1952.\n\nThe belated success of \"Rock Around the Clock\" is attributed to its use in the soundtrack of the film ''[[Blackboard Jungle]],''<ref name=pc5>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19751/m1/ |title=Show 5 \u2013 Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll: The Rock Revolution Gets Underway.

In late 1954, Haley and His Comets appeared in a [[short subject]] entitled ''Round Up of Rhythm'', performing three songs. This was the earliest known theatrical rock and roll film release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217775/|title=Round Up of Rhythm (1954) - IMDb|access-date=November 24, 2020|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BillHaley.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Bill Haley & His Comets in 1954. Left to right: Joey D'Ambrosio, Dick Richards, Bill Haley]]\nIn 1955, Lytle, Richards and Ambrose quit the Comets in a salary dispute and formed their own group, the [[The Jodimars|Jodimars]]. Haley hired several new musicians to take their place: [[Rudy Pompilli]] on sax, Al Rex (a former member of the Saddlemen) on double bass, and Ralph Jones on drums. In addition, lead guitarist [[Franny Beecher]], who had been a session musician for Haley since [[Danny Cedrone]]'s death in the spring of 1954, became a full-time Comet and Haley's first performing lead guitarist (Cedrone had played the guitar solo on the original recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" and died shortly after the recording session for \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" in the summer of 1954). This version of the band became more popular than the earlier manifestation and appeared in several [[motion pictures]] over the next few years.\n\nOther hits recorded by the band included \"[[See You Later, Alligator]]\"<ref name=pc5/> in which Haley's frantic delivery contrasted with the [[Louisiana]] languor of the original by [[Bobby Charles]], \"Don't Knock the Rock\", \"Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie\", \"Rudy's Rock\" (the first instrumental hit of the rock and roll era), and \"Skinny Minnie.\"\n\nBill Haley and the Comets performed \"Rock Around the Clock\" in an a cappella and a lip-synched version on the [[NBC]] television program ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' hosted by [[Milton Berle]] on May 31, 1955. Berle predicted that the song would go to Number 1, calling the band \"A group of entertainers who are going right to the top.\" Berle also sang and danced to the song, which was performed by the entire cast of the show. This was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre a much wider audience.\n\nBill Haley and the Comets were the first rock and roll performers to appear on the [[CBS]] television musical variety program ''The [[Ed Sullivan Show]], or Toast of the Town'' on Sunday, August 7, 1955, in a broadcast from the Shakespeare Festival Theater in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. They performed a live version of \"Rock Around the Clock\" featuring Franny Beecher on lead guitar and Dick Richards on drums. The group made a second and final appearance on the ''Ed Sullivan Show'' on Sunday, April 28, 1957, performing \"[[Rudy's Rock]]\" and \"Forty Cups of Coffee.\"\n\nBill Haley and the Comets appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television twice in 1957, on the prime-time show on October 28 and on the regular daytime show on November 27. The band also appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' (also known as ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]''), a prime-time TV series from New York on March 22, 1958, during the first season (performing \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Ooh, Look-a There, Ain't She Pretty\") and on February 20, 1960 (performing \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Tamiami\").\n\nIn 1956, the group appeared in two of the earliest full-length rock and roll movies with [[Alan Freed]]: ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]].'' The [[The Platters|Platters]] were co-stars in the first movie, and [[Little Richard]] appeared in the second. ''Rock Around the Clock'' was produced by Sam Katzman (who would produce several Elvis Presley films in the 1960s) and directed by Fred F. Sears.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=1403164%7C184955&name=Rock-Around-the-Clock|title=&#124;Rock Around the Clock |website=Tcm.com|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Decline in popularity==\nThe band's popularity in the United States began to wane in 1956\u201357 as sexier, wilder acts such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Little Richard]] began to dominate the record charts (although Haley's cover version of Little Richard's \"[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]\", released in direct competition with Little Richard's original recording, outsold the original). After \"Skinny Minnie\" hit the charts in 1958, Haley had little further success in the United States, although a spin-off group made up of Comets musicians dubbed '''The Kingsmen''' (no relation to the later group of \"[[Louie, Louie]]\" fame) had a hit with an instrumental, \"Weekend\", that same year.\n\nOverseas, however, Haley and his band continued to be popular, touring the United Kingdom in February 1957, when Haley and his crew were mobbed by thousands of fans at [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] in London at an incident which the media dubbed the \"Second [[Battle of Waterloo]]\". The group also toured Australia in 1957, and in 1958 enjoyed a successful (if riot-dominated) tour of the European mainland. Bill Haley & His Comets were the first major American rock and roll act to tour the world in this way. Elvis, who was [[Elvis Presley's Army career|on military duty]] in Germany, visited them backstage at some shows. On a free day in Berlin they performed two songs in the [[Caterina Valente]] movie ''Hier Bin ich Hier Bleib Ich (Here I Am Here I Stay)''.\n\nBack in the U.S., Haley attempted to start his own record label, Clymax, and establish his own stable of performers, notably [[Sally Starr (TV hostess)|Sally Starr]] (the hostess of a Philadelphia television children's program) and the [[Matys Brothers]]. Members of the Comets were commissioned to work as session musicians on many of these recordings, many of which were written or co-written by Haley and members of the Comets. The Clymax experiment only lasted about a year. In 1959, Haley's relationship with Decca collapsed; after a final set of instrumental-only recordings in the fall, Haley announced he was leaving Decca for the new [[Warner Bros. Records]] label, which released two more albums in 1960, which were moderately successful. In 1960 Franny Beecher and Rudi Pompilli left the Comets to start their own record label. Replacing Beecher was a 20-year-old guitarist, [[Johnny Kay]], from Chester, Pennsylvania. Beecher later returned briefly to play with the Comets, when his record label failed to take off, sharing guitar duties with Kay. Kay left the band in 1966 but returned in the early 1970s for an aborted world tour. He appeared in the Wembley show, which was filmed and released as the London Rock and Roll Show.\n\n==Mexico and the late 1960s==\nIn 1961\u20131962, '''Bill Haley y sus Cometas''' (as the band was known in Hispanic America) signed with the [[Orfe\u00f3n]] label of Mexico and scored an unexpected hit with \"Twist Espa\u00f1ol\", a Spanish-language recording based on the [[Twist (dance)|twist]] dance craze, which was sweeping America at the time. Haley followed up with \"Florida Twist\" (#3 MEX, according to Billboard Hits Of The World 04.21.62), which was for a time the biggest-selling single in Mexican history. Although [[Chubby Checker]] and [[Hank Ballard]] were credited with starting the twist craze in America, in Mexico and Latin America, Bill Haley and His Comets were proclaimed the Kings of the Twist. Thanks to the success of \"Twist Espa\u00f1ol\" and \"Florida Twist\", among others, the band had continued success in Mexico and Latin America over the next few years, selling many recordings of Spanish and Spanish-flavored material and simulated live performances ([[overdubbed]] audience over studio recordings) on the Orfeon label and its subsidiary, Dimsa. They hosted a television series, ''Orfeon a Go-Go'', and made [[cameo appearance]]s in several movies, lip-synching some of their old hits. Haley, who was fluent in Spanish, recorded a number of songs in the language, but most of the band's output during these years was instrumental recordings, many utilizing local session musicians playing trumpet. There was also some experimentation with Haley's style during this time; one single for Orfeon was a folk ballad, \"Jimmy Martinez\", which Haley recorded without the Comets.\n\nIn 1966, the Comets (without Bill Haley) cut an album for Orfeon as session musicians for Big Joe Turner, who had always been an idol to Haley; no joint performance of \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" was recorded, however. In a 1974 interview with [[BBC Radio]], Haley said Turner's career was in a slump at this time, so he used his then-considerable influence with Orfeon to get Turner a recording session. The Comets' association with Orfeon/Dimsa ended later that year.\n\nBy 1967, as related by Haley in an interview with radio host [[Red Robinson]] in that year, the group was \"a free agent\" without any recording contracts at all, although the band continued to perform regularly in North America and Europe. During this year, Haley\u2014without the Comets\u2014recorded a pair of demos in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]: a country-western song, \"[[Jealous Heart]]\", on which he was backed by a local [[mariachi]] band (similar in style to the earlier \"Jimmy Martinez\"), and a late-60s-style rocker, \"Rock on Baby\", backed by a group called Superfine Dandelion. Neither recording would be released for 30 years. In 1968, Haley and the Comets recorded a single for the [[United Artists]] label, a version of [[Tom T. Hall]]'s \"[[That's How I Got to Memphis]]\", but no long-term association with the label resulted. In order to revive his recording career, Haley turned to Europe.\n\n==Revival==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Little Richard Columbia 1956.jpg|left|thumb|Little Richard and Bill Haley on the set of the 1956 Columbia Pictures film ''Don't Knock the Rock''.]] -->\nBy the late 1960s, Haley and the Comets were considered an \"oldies\" act. The band's popularity never waned in Europe. The group signed a lucrative deal with [[Sonet Records]] of Sweden in 1968 and recorded in a new version of \"Rock Around the Clock\", which hit the European charts that year. The band recorded a mixture of live and studio albums for the label over the next decade.\n\nIn the United States in 1969, promoter Richard Nader launched a series of [[rock and roll revival]] concert tours featuring artists of the 1950s and 1960s. At one of the first of these shows, held at the [[Felt Forum]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, Haley received an eight-and-a-half-minute standing ovation following his performance, as Nader related in his recorded introduction to Haley's live album ''Bill Haley Scrapbook'', which was recorded a few weeks later at the [[The Bitter End|Bitter End]] club in New York.\n\nThe band appeared in several concert films in the early 1970s, including ''[[The London Rock and Roll Show]]'' (for which Haley's 1960\u201366 lead guitarist, John Kay, briefly rejoined the band) and ''[[Let the Good Times Roll (film)|Let the Good Times Roll]]''. After 1974, tax and management problems prevented Haley from performing in the United States, so he performed in Europe almost exclusively, though he also toured South America in 1975. The band was also kept busy in the studio, recording numerous albums for Sonet and other labels in the 1970s, several with a [[country music]] flavor. In 1974, Haley's original Decca recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" hit the American sales charts once again, thanks to its use in the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and for two years, on the television program ''[[Happy Days]]''.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Late career==\nIn February 1976, Haley's saxophone player and best friend, [[Rudy Pompilli]], died of [[cancer]] after a nearly 20-year career with the Comets. Haley continued to tour for the next year with a succession of new sax players, but his popularity was waning again, and his 1976 performance in London was critically lambasted in the music media, such as ''[[Melody Maker]]''. That year, the group also recorded an album, ''R-O-C-K'' at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] for Sonet Records. According to one source, \"he had conflicted feelings about fame, was extremely private, suffered chronic alcoholism, and troubled relationships\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFzMvgEACAAJ|title=Crazy Man, Crazy The Bill Haley Story|author=Bill Haley, Jr., Peter Benjaminson |page= |date=October 3, 2019 |publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=9781617137112|accessdate=November 10, 2023}}</ref> Having admitted to an alcohol problem in a 1974 radio interview for the [[BBC]],<ref name=FallingComet>{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/falling-comet/|title=Falling Comet|date=2011-06-01|website=Texas Monthly|language=en|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=bill+haley+%22alcoholism%22&pg=PP15|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|last=Bronson|first=Fred|date=2003|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2|language=en}}</ref> Haley continued to battle alcoholism into the 1970s. \nIn early 1977, Haley announced his retirement from performing and settled down at his home in Mexico. According to the John Swenson biography of Haley, the musician was quoted as saying that he and Pompilli had an agreement that if one died, the other would retire.\n\nThe Comets continued to tour on their own during this period.\n\nIn 1979, Haley was persuaded to return to performing with the offer of a lucrative contract to tour Europe. An almost completely new group of musicians, mostly British, including saxophonist [[Pete Thomas (saxophonist)|Pete Thomas]], were assembled to perform as the Comets. Haley appeared on numerous television shows and in the movie ''Blue Suede Shoes'', filmed at one of his London concerts in March 1979. A few days later, a performance in [[Birmingham]] was videotaped and aired on UK television; it was released on DVD in 2005. During the March tour, Haley recorded several tracks in London for his next album for Sonet, completing the work that summer in Muscle Shoals; the album, ''Everyone Can Rock & Roll'', issued later in 1979, was the last release of new recordings by Haley before his death.\n\nOn November 26, 1979, Haley and the Comets performed for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalvarietycharity.org/royal-variety-performance/archive/detail/1979-london-theatre-royal|title=Performances :: 1979, London Theatre Royal &#124; Royal Variety Charity|website=Royalvarietycharity.org|access-date=May 12, 2023}}</ref> a moment Haley considered the proudest of his career. It was also the last time he performed in Europe and the last time most fans saw him perform \"Rock Around the Clock\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}\n\nHaley made his final performances in South Africa in May and June 1980. Just before the South African tour commenced, Haley's health was reportedly failing, and he was reportedly diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]]; a planned tour of Germany in the autumn of 1980 was subsequently cancelled.  The tour was critically lambasted, but surviving recordings of a performance in [[Johannesburg]] show Haley in good spirits and good voice. Nonetheless, according to the Haley News fan club newsletter and the Haley biography ''Sound and Glory'', planned concerts (such as a fall 1980 tour of Germany) and proposed recording sessions in New York and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] were cancelled, including a potential reunion with past members of the Comets.\n\nDespite his illness, Haley started compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he returned to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]]. \nThe October 25, 1980, issue of German tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' reported that Haley had a brain tumor. Haley's British manager, Patrick Malynn, was quoted as saying that \"Haley had taken a fit [and] didn't recognize anyone anymore.\" In addition, a doctor who examined Haley said that the tumor was inoperable.<ref name=\"Bill Haley 1982. page 154\">''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll''. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. p. 154, {{ISBN|0-8128-2909-3}}</ref>  Haley's widow Martha, who was with him in these troubling times, denied he had a brain tumor, as did his close friend Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Haley did not want to go on the road anymore and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. McCallum said, \"It's my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card.\"<ref name=FallingComet/>\n\nHaley returned to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]].  At this time, Haley's alcoholism appeared to be worsening. According to Martha, by this time, she and Haley fought all the time, and she told him to stop drinking or move out. Eventually, he moved into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes, he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. \"There were days we never saw him,\" said his daughter Martha Maria.<ref name=FallingComet/> In addition to Haley's drinking problems, it was becoming evident that he was also developing serious mental health issues. Martha Maria said, \"It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking.\" After being picked up by the police in Harlingen several times for alleged intoxication, Martha had a judge put Haley in the hospital, where he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said Haley's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction, but said Haley would have to stop drinking. Martha said, \"This is pointless.\" She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house, and the downward spiral continued until his death.<ref name=FallingComet/>\n\nMedia reports immediately following his death indicated that Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in the final weeks of his life. According to a biography of Haley by John Swenson, released in 1982,<ref name=\"Bill Haley 1982\">''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll'', pp. 155-159, John Swenson. (1982. Pub.

The single reached Number 50 in the UK but was not released in the United States.\n\nIn 1987, Bill Haley was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. At that time, supporting bands were not also named to the Hall of Fame. This policy was subsequently changed, and in 2012 a special committee of the Hall of Fame inducted the Comets. Bill Haley and His Comets were also inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

The Comets placed their handprints in cement, leaving a space blank for Haley.\n\n==The Comets==\nMore than 100 musicians performed with Bill Haley & His Comets between 1952 and Haley's death in 1981, many becoming fan favorites along the way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |title=Bill Haley Extra Page 2 |publisher=Rockabillyhall.com |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011233205/http://rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |archive-date=October 11, 2011 }}</ref> Several short-lived Comets reunions were attempted in the 1970s and 1980s, including one contingent (organized by [[Baltimore]]-based piano player [[Joey Welz]], who played piano for the Comets from 1962 to 1965<ref name=\"The Bill Haley Who's Who\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |title=The Bill Haley Who's Who |publisher=Rockabilly Hall of Fame |access-date=March 26, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054809/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |archive-date=February 4, 2012 }}</ref>) that appeared on ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]'', and another run by an [[Elvis Presley]] impersonator, Joey Rand (this group later lost a legal action over the right to use the Comets name). Only one group was sent out to perform by Haley himself and his management and production company, consisting of musicians who had played with Haley throughout the 1960s and 1970s\u2014lead guitarist \"Nick Masters\" (Mathias Nicholas Nastos), bassist Ray Cawley, singer Ray \"Pudge\" Parsons, and drummer Buddy Dee\u2014and who had continued to perform as the Comets between gigs and during Haley's retirement. This group rerecorded \"Rock Around the Clock\" for the television series ''Happy Days''.<ref name=\"The Bill Haley Who's Who\"/>\n\n'''The Comets''', featuring musicians who performed with Haley in 1954\u20131955, reunited in 1987 and are still touring the world as of 2007, playing showrooms in the United States and Europe. They have also recorded a half-dozen albums for small labels in Europe and the United States. This version of the group has also been credited as '''Bill Haley's Original Comets''' and, in circumstances in which the use of the Comets name is in dispute, '''A Tribute to Bill Haley''' and '''The Original Band'''. The basic lineup of this group from 1987 to May 2006 was Marshall Lytle (bass), Joey Ambrose (sax), Johnny Grande (piano), Dick Richards (drums) and Franny Beecher (guitar). British singer Jacko Buddin augmented the group on vocals during most of their European tours, with Lytle taking over on vocals for US and Canadian tours beginning in 2000 and full-time in Europe in the mid-2000s. Since they connected with Klaus Kettner's Rock It Concerts (Germany) in 1991, they have played hundreds of shows all over Europe and have appeared on dozens of television shows. In March 2007 they opened the Bill-Haley-Museum in Munich, Germany.\n\nTwo additional groups claim the name '''Bill Haley's Comets''' and have extensively toured in the United States since forming in the 1980s: one originally led by Haley's 1965\u201368 drummer John \"Bam-Bam\" Lane, the other run by Al Rappa, who played bass for Haley off and on between late 1959 and early 1969. (The 1959 album \"Strictly Instrumental\" on Decca was Rappa's first recording session with Bill Haley & His Comets. Haley had used Rappa as a fill-in player on live gigs for several years prior to that.) Both these musicians claim [[trademark]] ownership of the name \"Bill Haley's Comets\"; this dates back to Lane and Rappa (during a period when they worked together as one band) winning a trademark infringement lawsuit against the aforementioned Joey Rand group in 1989. Both Rappa's and Lane's bands have, from time to time, recruited other former Comets for their lineups (for example, in 2005, Rappa joined forces with Joey Welz), but for the most part the bandleaders are the only regular members who have worked with Bill Haley directly. Lane died in 2007, but his group continues to perform, led by bandleader Lenny Longo, who has no direct connection with Bill Haley. Rappa incorporated numerous professional musicians from the southern Indiana area (Guitarist Warren Batts, Joe Esarey, Dave Matthews, Joe Denton, saxophonist John Urbina, bassist Jody Hamilton Miley (previous bassist with the George Jones Show), and others) to make a full band. Rappa performed his Upright Bass show before thousands in audiences all over the country. Members of Rappa's \"Comets\" went on to form the LocoMotion Showband and continued touring the United States without Rappa adding Galen Deig (Drums) and Jimmy Baze (Bass) before eventually disbanding. Esarey went on to graduate from Cedarville University and Luther Rice Theological Seminary. He has since pastored churches and produced his own saxophone instrumental albums. Several of the members are now active in a very popular Southern Indiana 50's / 60's band called The Duke Boys.\n\nIn March and July 2005, the members of the 1954\u201355 group, now billed as simply the Comets after decades of controversy over the use of the name, made several high-profile concert appearances in New York City and Los Angeles organized by [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] as part of celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of rock and roll, the release of ''Blackboard Jungle'', the 50th anniversary of \"Rock Around the Clock\" hitting Number 1, and the 80th birthday of Bill Haley.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-film-that-helped-launch-rock/ |title=The Film That Helped Launch Rock |work=CBS News |date=March 18, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604091217/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/18/sunday/main681742.shtml |archive-date=June 4, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Entertainment/5-06-29RocknRoll.htm |title=Rock 'N' Roll Turns 50 in July |publisher=Seniorjournal.com |date=June 29, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014044137/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Entertainment/5-06-29RocknRoll.htm |archive-date=October 14, 2011 }}</ref> During a concert at the [[Viper Room]] in [[West Hollywood]] on July 6, 2005, the Comets were joined on stage for one song by [[Gina Haley]], the youngest daughter of Bill Haley; at a similar appearance in March they were joined by Haley's eldest son, John W. Haley. The 1954\u201355 Comets were also joined on stage by Bill Haley Jr. during several appearances in 2005 at Bubba Mac's in Somers Point, New Jersey, and at a 2005 concert recognizing the tenure of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen at the Twin Bars in Gloucester City, New Jersey.\n\nIn 2006, the 1954\u201355 Comets spent much of the year in residence at Dick Clark's American Bandstand Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]]. Meanwhile, the John Lane edition of Bill Haley's Comets recorded an album in Tennessee in early 2006, which has yet to be released.\n\nOn June 2, 2006, Johnny Grande, keyboardist with the 1954\u201355 Comets and a founding member of the band, died after a short illness. The following month, 85-year-old guitarist [[Franny Beecher]] announced his retirement, though he was at one point announced as participating in an early 2007 tour of Germany. The three remaining original Comets (Lytle, Richards, and Ambrose) continued to perform in Branson with new musicians taking over the keyboard and lead guitar positions. During September 2006, [[PBS]] in the United States aired a series of programs videotaped in Branson during the spring of 2006; these shows include the last recorded performances of the complete Original Comets lineup, including Grande. Lytle died in 2013, Beecher in 2014.

They had two other sons, Cecil (1934\u201389) and James (1932\u20132010). The family soon moved to [[Beaumont, Texas]]. Richardson graduated from Beaumont High School in 1947 and played on the \"Royal Purple\" American football team as a defensive lineman, wearing number 85.<ref>''Big Bopper: From Head Waiter To Rock'N'Roll Hero''. T Knight \u2013 Goldmine, 1989</ref> Richardson later was a radio [[disc jockey]] while at [[Lamar University|Lamar College]],<ref name=b&m /> where he studied prelaw and was a member of the band and chorus.\n\n== Career ==\n=== Radio ===\nRichardson worked part-time at [[Beaumont, Texas]] radio station KTRM (now [[KZZB]]). He was hired by the station full-time in 1949 and quit college. Richardson married Adrianne Joy Fryou on April 18, 1952, and their daughter Debra Joy was born in December 1953, soon after Richardson was promoted to supervisor of announcers at KTRM. In March 1955, he was [[conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]] and did his basic training at [[Fort Ord]], California. Richardson spent the rest of his two-year service as a radar instructor at [[Fort Bliss]] in [[El Paso, Texas]]. In March 1957, following his discharge as a corporal, Richardson returned to KTRM radio, where he held down the \"Dishwashers' Serenade\" shift from 11&nbsp;a.m. to 12:30&nbsp;p.m., Monday to Friday.\n\nOne of the station's sponsors wanted Richardson for a new time slot, and suggested an idea for a show. Richardson had seen college students doing a dance called The Bop, and he decided to call himself \"The Big Bopper\". His new radio show ran from 3:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m., and he soon became the station's program director. In May 1957, Richardson broke the record for continuous on-air broadcasting by eight minutes. He performed for a total of five days, two hours, and eight minutes from a remote setup in the lobby of the [[Jefferson Theatre]] in downtown Beaumont, playing 1,821 records<ref name=accuracy /> and taking showers during five-minute newscasts.<ref name=\"b&m\">[https://www.bopperandme.co.uk/petition.php] {{dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref> Richardson is credited for creating the first music video in 1958, and recorded an early example himself.<ref name=accuracy>{{cite web|url=https://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Richardson,J.P.TheBigBopper.html|title=J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson|website=Accuracyproject.org|accessdate=January 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Singer and songwriter ===\n[[File:Big Bopper's Wedding - Little Red Riding Hood ad - Cash Box 1958.jpg|thumb|Advertisement featured in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine, 13 December 1958]] \nRichardson, who played guitar, began his musical career as a songwriter. [[George Jones]] later recorded Richardson's \"[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]\", which became Jones's first No. 1 country hit in 1959 (#73 on the pop charts). Richardson also wrote \"[[Running Bear]]\" for [[Johnny Preston]], his friend from [[Port Arthur, Texas]]. The inspiration for the song came from Richardson's childhood memory of the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]], where he heard stories about [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes. Preston's recording was not released until August 1959, six months after Richardson's death. The song became a No. 1 hit for three weeks in January 1960. The man who launched Richardson as a recording artist was [[Pappy Daily|Harold \"Pappy\" Daily]] from [[Houston]]. Daily was promotion director for [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] and [[Starday Records]] and signed Richardson to Mercury. Richardson's first single, \"Beggar to a King\", had a country flavor, but failed to gain any chart action.\n\nRichardson soon cut \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" as \"The Big Bopper\"<ref name=pc14>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19763/m1/ |title= Show 14 \u2013 Big Rock Candy Mountain: Rock 'n' roll in the late fifties |show=14}}</ref> for Pappy Daily's [[D (record label)|D label]].

In November 1958, he scored a second hit, a raucous novelty tune entitled \"The Big Bopper's Wedding\", in which Richardson pretends to be getting [[cold feet]] at the altar.

His son, Jay Perry Richardson, was born two months after his death, in April 1959. Richardson had been building a recording studio in his home in [[Beaumont, Texas]], and was planning to invest in a radio station. Richardson had written 20 new songs that he planned to record himself or with other artists. His son also followed a musical career and was known professionally as \"The Big Bopper, Jr.\", performing around the world. He toured on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour with Buddy Holly impersonator John Mueller on some of the same stages where his father had performed.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nIn January 2007, Jay Richardson requested that his father's body be exhumed and an autopsy be performed in response to an internet rumor about guns being fired aboard the aircraft and Richardson initially surviving the crash.<ref>{{cite news|title=Autopsy of 'Big Bopper' to Address Rumors About 1959 Plane Crash|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/17/AR2007011701976.html|website=Washingtonpost.com|date=January 18, 2007}}</ref> The autopsy was performed by [[William M.

On the 11th night of the tour (February 2, 1959), they played at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]]. That night, Holly chartered an airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]], intending to fly himself and his bandmates [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Tommy Allsup]] to their next tour venue in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. The musicians had been traveling by bus for over a week, and it had already broken down twice. They were tired, they had not been paid yet, and all of their clothes were dirty. The chartered flight would allow them to avoid another arduous bus ride, arrive early before the Moorhead show, do their laundry, and get some rest. Local pilot [[Roger Peterson (pilot)|Roger Peterson]] of Dwyer Flying Service (age 21) had agreed to take them. The weather forecast for the Clear Lake area was {{convert|18|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} that night with moderate gusty winds and light scattered snow, and Peterson was fatigued from a 17-hour workday, but he agreed to fly the trip.\n\n[[Frankie Sardo]] went to meet the crowd while Holly went into one of the dressing rooms at the Surf Ballroom where he notified Allsup and Jennings that he had chartered a plane to take them to [[Fargo, North Dakota]] (which is directly adjacent to Moorhead, Minnesota). On a friendly wager, Valens flipped a coin with Allsup for his seat on the plane\u2014and won. Meanwhile, J.P. Richardson was suffering from the flu and was complaining that the bus was too cold and uncomfortable for him, so Jennings voluntarily surrendered his seat. Upon hearing that his bandmates had given away their plane seats, Holly joked, \"Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up again.\" Jennings jokingly replied, \"Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-how-waylon-jennings-survived-the-day-the-music-died-122992/ |title=Flashback: How Waylon Jennings Survived Buddy Holly Crash |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=February 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe Clear Lake show ended at around midnight and Holly, Valens, and Richardson drove to the Mason City Airport, loaded their luggage and boarded the red and white single-engine [[Beechcraft Bonanza]]. Peterson received clearance from the control tower around 12:55&nbsp;a.m. on February 3, 1959, and they took off\u2014but the plane remained airborne for only a few minutes. It crashed at full throttle shortly after takeoff about 5 miles outside Mason City in the middle of farm country. The reason remains unknown but Peterson may have lost his visual reference and thought that he was ascending while he was actually descending.

Richardson's pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. The Big Bopper is fondly remembered not only for his distinctive singing and songwriting, but also as a humorist who combined the best elements of country, R&B, and rock 'n' roll.\n\nIn 2010, Richardson was inducted into the [[Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iowarocknroll.com/big-bopper |title=Big Bopper &#124; iowarocknroll |access-date=November 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627120647/https://www.iowarocknroll.com/big-bopper |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRichardson's name is mentioned as one of the upcoming musical acts in both the print and television versions of [[Stephen King]]'s short story \"[[You Know They Got a Hell of a Band]]\" about a town inhabited by late musical legends.

She performed on television in the UK in 1959, before she had achieved much pop recognition in the United States. Her first hit single in the UK was \"[[Sweet Nothin's]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;4 on the UK singles chart in the spring of 1960. She subsequently had a UK hit (in 1961) with \"[[Let's Jump the Broomstick]]\", a rockabilly number recorded in 1959, which had not charted in the United States, but reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK.<ref name=Bernstein />\n\nLee had two Top Ten hits in the UK that were not released as singles in her native country: the first, \"[[Speak to Me Pretty]]\" peaked at No.&nbsp;3 in May 1962 and was her greatest hit in the UK by chart placing, swiftly followed by \"[[Here Comes That Feeling]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;5 in the summer of 1962. The latter was issued as the B-side to \"[[Everybody Loves Me But You]]\" in the United States (which peaked at No.&nbsp;6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100); however, \"Here Comes That Feeling\" also made an appearance in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, peaking at No.&nbsp;89, despite its B-side status in the US.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}\n\nIn 1962, while touring [[West Germany]], Lee appeared at the [[Star-Club]], [[Hamburg]], with the Beatles as the opening act.<ref name=Bernstein /> Lee also had big hits in the UK with \"[[All Alone Am I]]\" (No.&nbsp;7 in 1963) and \"[[As Usual]]\" (No.&nbsp;5 in 1964).{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}\n\nLee first visited England for three days in April 1959 as a last-minute replacement on ''[[Oh Boy!

The follow-up, the [[Mark James (songwriter)|Mark James]] composition \"[[Sunday Sunrise (song)|Sunday Sunrise]]\", reached No.&nbsp;6 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]''{{'s}} Hot Country Singles chart that October.

Two follow-ups also reached the Top 10 in 1980: \"[[The Cowgirl and the Dandy]]\" and \"[[Broken Trust]]\" (the latter featuring vocal backing by [[the Oak Ridge Boys]]). A 1982 album, ''[[The Winning Hand]]'', featuring Lee along with [[Dolly Parton]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Willie Nelson]], was a surprise hit, reaching the top ten on the U.S. country albums chart. Her last well-known hit was 1984's \"[[Hallelujah, I Love Her So]]\" in duet with [[George Jones]] (Lee sang this song individually before and released it in 1960 on ''[[This Is...Brenda]]'').

He was born to a musical family in [[Lubbock, Texas]], during the [[Great Depression]], and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. Holly's style was country and western music which he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school.\n\nHolly made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group Buddy and Bob with his friend [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]]. In 1955, after opening for [[Elvis Presley]] as part of the Louisiana Hayride's habit of seeking out local bands to add to the show, Holly decided to pursue a career in music. Subsequently, he played with Presley three times that year and his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when Holly opened for [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], he was spotted by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with [[Decca Records]].\n\nHolly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by [[Owen Bradley]], who had become famous for producing orchestrated country hits for stars like [[Patsy Cline]]. Unhappy with Bradley's musical style and control in the studio, Holly went to producer [[Norman Petty]] in [[Clovis, New Mexico]], and recorded a demo of \"[[That'll Be the Day]]\", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to [[Brunswick Records]], which released it as a single credited to [[The Crickets]], a name chosen by the band to subvert Decca's contract limitations. It became the name of Holly's band. In September 1957, as the band toured, \"That'll Be the Day\" topped the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957|US]] and [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] singles charts. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, \"[[Peggy Sue]]\".\n\nThe album ''[[The \"Chirping\" Crickets]]'', released in November 1957, reached number five on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Holly made his second appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in January 1958 and soon after toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of future country music star [[Waylon Jennings]] (bass), famed session musician [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums), and embarked on a tour of the mid-western US. After a show in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly, [[Ritchie Valens]], [[The Big Bopper]], and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by [[Don McLean]] as \"[[The Day the Music Died]]\" in his song \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\".\n\nDuring his short career, Holly wrote and recorded many songs. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums.  This was unfounded considering he first saw Elvis with this line-up in Lubbock in 1955 when Holly was strictly a country music band. Holly was a major influence on later popular music artists, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Brian May]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[the Hollies]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[Fiona Apple]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Marshall Crenshaw]], [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Elton John]]. Holly was among the first artists inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in 1986. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of 100 Greatest Artists in 2010. Holly was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=swieser@panolawatchman.com |first=Stella Wieser |date=2022-08-10 |title=Texas Country Music Hall of Fame announces 2022 inductees |url=https://www.panolawatchman.com/news/texas-country-music-hall-of-fame-announces-2022-inductees/article_359dcf74-16de-11ed-9286-4396dc593295.html |access-date=2024-09-26 |website=Panola Watchman |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life and career (1936\u20131955)===\nCharles Hardin Holley (spelled \"-ey\") was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], on September 7, 1936, the youngest of four children of Lawrence Odell \"L.O.\" Holley (1901\u20131985) and Ella Pauline Drake (1902\u20131990).

Buddy Holly was baptized a Baptist, and the family were members of the Tabernacle Baptist Church.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=12}}\n\nThe Holleys had an interest in music; all the family members except L.O. were able to play an instrument or sing. The elder Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin. Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the bow so it would not make any sound. The brothers won the contest.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=13}} During World War II, Larry and Travis were called to military service. Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific. At age 11, at his mother's urging, Buddy took piano lessons but abandoned them after nine months. He switched to the guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus. Buddy's parents initially bought him a [[steel guitar]], but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother's. His parents bought him an acoustic guitar from a local pawnshop, and he learned how to play it from Travis.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=14}}\n\nDuring his early childhood, Holly was influenced by the music of [[Hank Williams]], [[Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Moon Mullican]], [[Bill Monroe]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Bob Wills]], and the [[Carter Family]]. At Roscoe Wilson Elementary, Holly became friends with [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]], and the two played together, practicing with songs by [[The Louvin Brothers]] and [[Johnnie & Jack]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=34}} They both listened to the radio programs ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on [[WSM (AM)|WSM]], ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' on [[KWKH]], and ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. At the same time, Holly played with other musicians he met in high school, including [[Sonny Curtis]] and [[Jerry Allison]].{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|p=80|2007}} In 1952 Holly and Jack Neal participated as a duo billed as Buddy and Jack in a talent contest on a local television show. After Neal left, he was replaced by Bob Montgomery, and they were billed as Buddy and Bob. They soon started performing on the ''Sunday Party'' show on [[KDAV]] in 1953 and performed live gigs in Lubbock.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=6|2003}} At that time, Holly was influenced by late-night radio stations that played blues and rhythm and blues (R&B). He would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could only be received at night, when local transmissions ceased.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=7|2003}} Holly then modified his music by blending his earlier [[country and western]] influence with R&B.{{sfn|Wishart|p=540|2004}} We do know it wasn't until Holly saw Elvis in Lubbock that led him to follow the Presley example.\n\nBy 1955, after graduating from [[Lubbock High School]], Holly decided to pursue a full-time career in music. He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley perform live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV. In February, Holly opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum. By that time, Holly had incorporated into his band Larry Welborn on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from country and western to [[rock and roll]] due to seeing Presley's performances and hearing his music.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=7|2003}} In October, Stone booked Bill Haley & His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall. Impressed, Crandall persuaded [[Grand Ole Opry]] manager Jim Denny to seek a recording contract for Holley. Stone sent a demo tape, which Denny forwarded to [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], who signed the band to [[Decca Records]] in February 1956.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|p=130|1997}} In the contract, Decca misspelled Holly's surname as \"Holly\", and from then on he was known as Buddy Holly, instead of his real name Holley.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}\n\nOn January 26, 1956, Holly attended his first formal recording session, which was produced by [[Owen Bradley]].{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=97}} He attended two more sessions in Nashville, but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements, Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} In April 1956, Decca released \"[[Blue Days, Black Nights]]\" as a single, with \"Love Me\" on the B-side. Denny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for [[Faron Young]]. During the tour, they were promoted as Buddy Holly and the Two Tones, while later Decca called them Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} The label later released Holly's second single \"Modern Don Juan\", [[b-side|backed with]] \"You Are My One Desire\". Neither single made an impression. On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed, but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.{{sfn|Uslan|Solomon|1981|p=49}}\n\n===The Crickets (1956\u20131957) ===\n{{Main article|The Crickets}}\n[[File:Buddy Holly & The Crickets publicity portrait - cropped.jpg|Buddy Holly and the Crickets in 1957 (top to bottom: Allison, Holly and Mauldin)|thumb]]\nHolly was unhappy with the results of his time with Decca, and inspired by the success of [[Buddy Knox]]'s \"[[Party Doll]]\" and [[Jimmy Bowen]]'s \"[[I'm Stickin' with You]]\", he visited [[Norman Petty]], who had produced and promoted both records. Together with Allison, bassist [[Joe B. Mauldin]], and rhythm guitarist [[Niki Sullivan]], he went to Petty's studio in [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The group recorded a demo of \"[[That'll Be the Day]]\", a song they had previously recorded in Nashville. In June 1956, Holly along with his older brother Larry as well as Allison and [[Sonny Curtis]] had gone to see the film ''[[The Searchers]]'', starring [[John Wayne]], in which Wayne repeatedly used the phrase \"That'll be the day\". This line of dialogue inspired the young musicians.<ref>Trzcinski, Matthew (February 10, 2022).

Petty became his manager and sent the record to [[Brunswick Records]] in New York City. Holly, still under contract with Decca, could not release the record under his name, so a band name was used; Allison proposed the name \"Crickets.\" Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release \"That'll Be the Day\", leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Amburn |first=Ellis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EAGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT101 |title=Buddy Holly: A Biography |date=April 22, 2014 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=9781466868564 |page=101 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>\n\nImpressed with the demo, the label's executives released it without recording a new version. \"I'm Looking for Someone to Love\" was the B-side; the single was credited to [[The Crickets]]. Petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca, which legally cleared future recordings under the name Buddy Holly. Recordings credited to the Crickets would be released on Brunswick, while the recordings under Holly's name were released on another subsidiary label, [[Coral Records]]. Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=131}}\n\nNorman Petty reasoned correctly that disc jockeys would be reluctant to play and promote multiple new records by the same artist, but would have no problem playing these same records if they were credited to different performers. Holly himself was unaware of this strategy; in a 1957 radio interview with Dale Lowery, Holly said, \"We have three records going out right now. Of course, the first one was 'That'll Be the Day', the first one released. Then we have a new one out by The Crickets, called 'Oh Boy!' and 'Not Fade Away', and then there's one out, it's the same group but it's under my name -- I don't know why they did it that way, but it went out under my name -- called 'Peggy Sue' and 'Everyday'.\"<ref>Buddy Holly interviewed by Dale Lowery for KTOP radio (Topeka, Kansas), 1957.</ref> Holly's records were released with labels reading \"Buddy Holly\" ''or'' \"The Crickets\"; the band was never credited on records as \"Buddy Holly ''and'' the Crickets\" until 1962, when a compilation album was released.\n\n\"That'll Be the Day\" was released on July 27, 1957. Petty booked Holly and the Crickets for a tour with [[Irvin Feld]], who had noticed the band after \"That'll Be the Day\" appeared on the R&B chart. He booked them for appearances in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and New York City.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=16}} The band was booked to play at New York's [[Apollo Theater]] on August 16\u201322. During the opening performances, the group did not impress the audience, but they were accepted after they included \"[[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|Bo Diddley]].\" By the end of their run at the Apollo, \"That'll Be the Day\" was climbing the charts. Encouraged by the single's success, Petty started to prepare two album releases; a solo album for Holly and another for the Crickets.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=17}} Holly appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], on August 26. Before leaving New York, the band befriended [[The Everly Brothers]].{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=18}}\n[[File:That'll Be the Day ad - Cash Box 1957.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' advertisement, August 3, 1957]] \n\"That'll Be the Day\" topped the [[Number-one hits of 1957 (United States)|US \"Best Sellers in Stores\"]] chart on September 23 and was number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in November.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=19}} Three days prior, Coral released \"[[Peggy Sue]]\", backed with \"[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]\", with Holly credited as the performer. By October, \"Peggy Sue\" had reached number three on ''Billboard''{{'}}s pop chart and number two on the R&B chart; it peaked at number six on the UK Singles chart. As the success of the song grew, it brought more attention to Holly, with the band at the time being billed as \"Buddy Holly and the Crickets\"{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=57}} (although never on records during Holly's lifetime).\n\nIn the last week of September, the band members flew to Lubbock to visit their families.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=58}} Holly's high school girlfriend, Echo McGuire, had left him for a fellow student.{{sfn|Norman|p=156|1996}} Aside from McGuire, Holly had a relationship with Lubbock fan June Clark.{{sfn|Norman|p=127|1996}} After Clark ended their relationship, Holly realized the importance of his relationship with McGuire and considered his relationship with Clark a temporary one.{{sfn|Norman|p=156|1996}} Meanwhile, for their return to recording, Petty arranged a session in [[Oklahoma City]], where he was performing with his own band. While the band drove to the location, the producer set up a makeshift studio. The rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded; Petty later dubbed the material in Clovis.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=58}} The resulting album, ''[[The \"Chirping\" Crickets]]'', was released on November 27, 1957. It reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. In October, Brunswick released the second single by the Crickets, \"[[Oh, Boy! (The Crickets song)|Oh, Boy!]]\", with \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" on the B-side.

Upon their return to the United States, Holly and the Crickets joined Alan Freed's ''Big Beat Show'' tour for 41 dates.

The session produced the recordings of \"[[It's So Easy! (The Crickets song)|It's So Easy]]\" and \"[[Heartbeat (Buddy Holly song)|Heartbeat]].\" Holly was impressed by Allsup and invited him to join the Crickets. In June, Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session. Without the Crickets, he chose to be backed by a jazz and R&B band, recording \"Now We're One\" and [[Bobby Darin]]'s \"[[Early in the Morning (Bobby Darin song)|Early in the Morning]].\"{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=91}}\n\nDuring a visit to the offices of [[Peermusic|Peer-Southern]], Holly met [[Mar\u00eda Elena Santiago]]. He asked her out on their first meeting and proposed marriage to her on their first date. The wedding took place on August 15. Norman Petty had tried to dissuade Holly from marriage; he felt that it would disappoint Holly's public and damage his career.\n\nHolly and Santiago frequented many of New York's music venues, including the [[Village Gate]], Blue Note, [[Village Vanguard]], and Johnny Johnson's. Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar and that he would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there. Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll. He wanted to make an album with [[Ray Charles]] and [[Mahalia Jackson]]. Holly also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=281}}\n\nSantiago accompanied Holly on tours. To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets' secretary. She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up and collected the concert revenues. Santiago kept the money for the band instead of its habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico.{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=274}} She and her aunt Provi Garcia, an executive in the Latin American music department at Peer-Southern, convinced Holly that Petty was paying the band's royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company's account. Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and to later fire him as manager and producer. At the recommendation of the Everly Brothers, Holly hired lawyer Harold Orenstein to negotiate his royalties.{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=280}} The problems with Petty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly. At the time, New York promoter Manny Greenfield reclaimed a large part of Holly's earnings; Greenfield had booked Holly for shows during previous tours. The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings. Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly's manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused. Greenfield then sued Holly. Under New York law, because Holly's royalties originated in New York and were directed out of the state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled.{{sfn|Laing|p=153|2010}}\n\nIn September, Holly returned to Clovis for a new recording session, which yielded \"Reminiscing\" and \"Come Back Baby.\" During the session, he ventured into producing by recording Lubbock DJ [[Waylon Jennings]]. Holly produced the single \"Jole Blon\" and \"When Sin Stops (Love Begins)\" for Jennings.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=155}} Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music, recording, and publishing scene. Holly and Santiago settled in Apartment 4H of the Brevoort Apartments, at 11 Fifth Avenue in [[Greenwich Village]], where he recorded a series of acoustic songs, including \"[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]\" and \"What to Do.\"{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=274\u2013278}} The inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship with McGuire.{{sfn|Lloyd Webber|2015}}\n\nOn October 21, 1958, Holly's final studio session was recorded at the [[Pythian Temple (New York City)|Pythian Temple]] on West 70th Street (now a luxury condominium). Known by Holly fans as \"the string sessions\", Holly recorded four songs for Coral in an innovative collaboration with an 18-piece ensemble composed of former members of the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] (including saxophonist [[Boomie Richman]]) under the direction of [[Dick Jacobs]].\n\nThe four songs recorded during the {{frac|3|1|2}}-hour session were: \n*\"True Love Ways\" (written by Buddy Holly), \n*\"[[Moondreams (Norman Petty song)|Moondreams]]\" (written by [[Norman Petty]]), \n*\"[[Raining in My Heart]]\" (written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant) and \n*\"[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]\" (written by Paul Anka).{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=276\u2013278}}\nThese four songs were the only ones Coral ever mixed in stereo, but only \"Raining in My Heart\" was released that way (in 1959, on an obscure promotional LP titled ''Hitsville''). All four records otherwise received releases in mono. The original stereo mixes were consulted many years later for compilation albums.\n\nHolly ended his association with Petty in December 1958. His band members kept Petty as their manager and split from Holly. The split was amicable and based on logistics: Holly had decided to settle permanently in New York, where the business and publishing offices were, and the Crickets preferred not to leave their home state.\n\n===Winter Dance Party tour and death (1959)===\n{{Main|The Day the Music Died}}\n[[File:GlassesSign.jpg|thumb|right|Signpost near the Clear Lake crash site]]\n\nHolly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings's radio station in December 1958.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 51}} For the start of the [[Winter Dance Party]] tour, he assembled a band consisting of [[Waylon Jennings]] (electric bass), [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums).{{sfn|Corbin, Sky|2014}} Holly and Jennings left for New York City, arriving on January 15, 1959.

The amount of travel involved created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer, Carl Bunch, was hospitalized for [[frostbite]] to his toes (sustained while aboard the bus), so Holly decided to seek other transportation.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA13 13]}} On February 2, before their appearance in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered a four-seat [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] airplane for Jennings, Allsup, and himself, from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]]. Holly's idea was to depart following the show at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue, in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], via [[Fargo, North Dakota]], allowing them time to rest and launder their clothes and avoid an arduous bus journey. Immediately after the Clear Lake show (which ended just before midnight), Allsup agreed to flip a coin for the seat with [[Ritchie Valens]]. Valens called heads; when he won, he reportedly said, \"That's the first time I've ever won anything in my life.\" Allsup later opened a restaurant/bar in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], called Heads Up Saloon.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Galloway |first=Paul |date=June 24, 1988 |title=Hit parade |work=Chicago Tribune |id={{ProQuest|882608515}}}}</ref> Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to [[The Big Bopper|J.

However, an autopsy done at the request of Richardson's son in 2007 found no evidence to support the rumors.

The following day, she suffered a miscarriage. Holly's mother, who heard the news on the radio in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. Because of Elena's miscarriage, in the months following the accident, some government authorities implemented a policy against announcing victims' names until after families are informed.{{sfn|Suddath|2009}} Santiago did not attend the funeral and has never visited the gravesite.

The finished tracks became the first posthumous Holly single, \"[[Peggy Sue Got Married (song)|Peggy Sue Got Married]]\"/\"[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]].\" The new release was successful enough to warrant an album drawing upon the other Holly demos, using the same studio personnel, in January 1960.<ref>Goldrosen, John (1979).

During the January 1969 recording sessions for their album ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'', the Beatles played a slow, impromptu version of \"Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues\" \u2013 which Holly popularized but did not write \u2013 with Lennon mimicking Holly's vocal style.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2014|p=186}} Lennon recorded a cover version of \"Peggy Sue\" on his 1975 album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]''.{{sfn|Blaney, John|p=163|2005}} McCartney owns the [[Music publisher|publishing rights]] to Holly's song catalog.{{sfn|BBC News staff|2003}}\n\n==== Bob Dylan ====\nOn January 31, 1959, two nights before Holly's death, 17-year-old [[Bob Dylan]] attended Holly's performance in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. Dylan referred to this in his acceptance speech when he received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] for ''[[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|Time Out of Mind]]'' in 1998: \"...&nbsp;when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at [[Duluth National Guard Armory]] and I was three feet away from him&nbsp;... and he looked at me.

The Rolling Stones had a hit version of the song in 1964.{{sfn|Norman|p=12|2011}} Richards later said, \"[Holly] passed it on via the Beatles and via [the Rolling Stones]&nbsp;...&nbsp;He's in everybody.\"{{sfn|Amburn, Ellis|2014|p=274}}\n\n==== Steve Marriott ====\nFrom a young age, [[Steve Marriott]] was a huge fan of Holly and would mimic his hero by wearing large-rimmed spectacles with the lenses removed. Marriott wrote his first song, called \"Shelia My Dear\", after his aunt Shelia to whom he was close. Those who heard the song said it was played at a jaunty pace in the style of Holly and his bandmates also nicknamed him 'Buddy'.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hewitt |first1=Paolo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4fwswEACAAJ |title=Steve Marriott: All Too Beautiful |last2=Hellier |first2=John |date=2004 |publisher=Helter Skelter Publishing |isbn=978-1-900924-44-3 |pages=44 |language=en}}</ref> Marriott also recorded a version of [[Kenny Lynch]]'s song \"Give Her My Regards\" b/w \"Imaginary Love\", the B-side written by Marriott, and released as a [[Single (music)|45-rpm]] in 1963 on Decca, inspired by Buddy Holly and the Crickets.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/master/907139-Steve-Marriott-Give-Her-My-Regards \"Steve Marriott - Give Her My Regards\"].

The song's lyric, which calls the incident \"The Day the Music Died\", became popularly associated with the crash. McLean's album ''[[American Pie (Don McLean album)|American Pie]]'' is dedicated to Holly.{{sfn|Crouse, Richard|p=86|2012}} In 2015, McLean wrote, \"Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments&nbsp;...&nbsp;By the time he was 22 years old, he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself&nbsp;...&nbsp;in my view and the view of many others, a hit&nbsp;...&nbsp;Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed.\"{{sfn|McLean|2015}}\n\n==== Eric Clapton ====\n''The Chirping Crickets'' was the first album [[Eric Clapton]] ever bought; he later saw Holly on ''Sunday Night at the London Palladium''. In his autobiography, Clapton recounted the first time he saw Holly and his Fender, saying, \"I thought I'd died and gone to heaven&nbsp;...&nbsp;it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself: 'That's the future \u2013 that's what I want{{'\"}}.{{sfn|Clapton, Eric|p=19|2010}} In 1969, his supergroup [[Blind Faith]] released a cover version of Holly's \"Well All Right\" featuring [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gallucci |first=Michael |date=January 11, 2023 |title=Top 10 Jeff Beck Songs |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jeff-beck-songs/ |access-date=May 22, 2024 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Bobby Vee====\nThe launch of [[Bobby Vee]]'s successful musical career resulted from Holly's death; Vee was selected to replace Holly on the tour that continued after the plane crash.

Originally from New Jersey, he formed Red Wanting Blue in the fall of 1995. In 1996 Red Wanting Blue released their first full-length album titled ''Velveteen''.  While still in college in 1998, the band went on to release their second full-length album ''The Image Trigger''.\n\n===''Model Citizen'' (2000\u20132001)===\n''Model Citizen'' was RWB's third studio release and arguably their breakthrough album. It was the first album with current bassist, Mark McCullough. After the release of ''Model Citizen'', Red Wanting Blue started gaining media attention for their rapidly growing grassroots following. The original version of the song ''Audition'' was recorded for this album. The song was picked up nationally by [[Abercrombie and Fitch]] and placed on rotation at their stores throughout the US. ''Audition'' was later re-vamped and re-recorded for the 2011 album ''From the Vanishing Point'' and found success on the radio and television in 2012 and 2013.\n\n===''Sirens'' (2001\u20132002)===\n''Sirens'' is Red Wanting Blue's fourth studio release. The band would eventually dedicate ''Sirens'' to those lives lost during the [[September 11 attacks]]. Red Wanting Blue toured to support ''Sirens'' by headlining small rock clubs across the US.\n\n===''Souvenirs of City Life'' (2002\u20132003)===\n''Souvenirs of City Life'' is the band's fifth studio release. ''Souvenirs of City Life'' debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on [[Aware Records]] online store \u2013 awarestore.com. Red Wanting Blue toured extensively during this time period headlining rock clubs and also touring alongside longtime friends [[O.A.R.

Honored, the band thanked those fans in the liner notes of this album. RWB picked up an additional member, guitarist, keyboardist and back-up vocalist Greg Rahm. RWB independently set out on a large tour (headlining venues from mid-level clubs to small theaters) stretching from New York to California. Songs from this album found themselves on [[XM Satellite Radio]]. During this time RWB was featured as an unsigned band to watch on Demodiaries.com, Kings of A&R and Hits Magazine. \n\n===''The Warehouse Sessions'' (2006\u20132008)===\n''The Warehouse Sessions'' is a live album/DVD recorded in the band's warehouse and studio space in front of 100 of RWB biggest fans from across the country. Tickets to this intimate event sold out in under two minutes. ''The Warehouse Sessions'' debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on Awarestore.com ([[Aware Records]] online store) in its first week of pre-sale. It was made to bridge the gap between ''Pride: The Cold Lover'' and 2008's ''These Magnificent Miles''. This album/DVD featured early acoustic versions of fan favorites \"You Are My Las Vegas\" and \"Finger in the Air\" from ''These Magnificent Miles''.\n\n===''These Magnificent Miles'' (2008\u20132010)===\n[[File:Centennial Concert (4268332410).jpg|thumb|Performing at [[Anderson Arena]] in 2010.]]\nThe band enlisted Grammy nominated producer Jamie Candiloro ([[Ryan Adams]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Willie Nelson]]) for ''These Magnificent Miles''. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] is quoted as saying that this album was inspired by \"the circus life of a band on the road.\" Current guitarist Eric Hall began his career with Red Wanting Blue during this time period. The band settled into an Americana rock \u2018n\u2019 roll vibe utilizing more melodic sounds than that of their prior work. Drummer Dean Anshutz joined the band toward the end of this album cycle.\n\nAfter signing with Fanatic Records in April 2010, ''These Magnificent Miles'' was re-released nationally on July 27, 2010, for a wider audience. Fanatic also issued a deluxe double-LP edition of ''These Magnificent Miles'' with full-color LP sleeves featuring the art of John Terry ([[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]]'s brother). In September 2010, the single \"Where You Wanna Go\" was heard on radio stations across the country. An eccentric music video was released for \"Where You Wanna Go\" featuring the band finding themselves trapped in an Alice in Wonderland type setting. Red Wanting Blue settled into a rhythm on tour of nearly selling out venues in advance (large rock clubs and mid-sized theaters), most shows during this time period selling out by day of show. The band's following in major cities like NYC started doubling in size with each live concert.\n\nRed Wanting Blue was commissioned to write a song for the film \"Unraveled\". The song called \"Magic Man\" was released as a single and is played in its entirety during the film. The documentary \"These Magnificent Miles \u2013 On the Long Road with Red Wanting Blue\" was released in April 2011. The band does not sell or support the documentary. On April 13, 2011, lead singer [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] was the guest star on [[NPR]] Radio's Snap Judgement and told a story about the band traveling through Yellowstone National Park and running into \"trouble\". In June 2011 Red Wanting Blue was presented with the Key to the City from the mayor of Kearney, Nebraska.\n\n===''From The Vanishing Point'' (2011\u20132014)===\n[[File:Red Wanting Blue band, 2012.jpg|thumb|Red Wanting Blue, 2012. Photo by Jason Tanaka Blaney]]\nIn early 2011, the band headed into the studio to begin recording their second official label release (RWB's 9th album). Once again, the band enlisted the talents of Jamie Candiloro to produce the album. The title of the album was released on August 5, 2011, through social media outlets. ''From the Vanishing Point'' was originally slated for release in the fall of 2011, but the album release was pushed back to January 2012.<ref name=\"PittPost Gazette06072012\" /> In the weeks before its release ''From the Vanishing Point'' was streamed over 80,000 times in the month of October alone. Over 150,000 streams of the album were recorded by the turn of 2012. \"From the Vanishing Point\" landed at ''#10 on The ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Chart'' in its first official week of release.<ref name=\"Heatseekers 2012\" /> The singles \"Audition,\" \"Stay on the Bright Side\" and \"White Snow\" were released on [[Adult Album Alternative]] radio also known as AAAradio or Triple-A. The music video for \"Audition\" was shot live, in one-take on October 13 at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus, OH. The intention was to introduce the authentic live energy of the band without including the \"Hollywood magic\" that is involved in most \"live-style\" music videos. In November 2011, Red Wanting Blue along with producer Jamie Candiloro headed back into the studio to record \"[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]\" as a holiday treat for their fans. The song found its way to the radio and was picked up as a holiday single. Music Choice Television also picked up the song as a holiday single.<ref name=\"music choice\">[http://www.rtbot.net/fanatic_records Fanatic Records Information, Videos, Pictures and News.]</ref>\n\nRWB's album release tour kicked off in January 2012 and consisted of several months of sold-out shows from Chicago to New York City and more. This time proved to be the band's most successful period of touring to date with concerts selling out weeks in advance. In the morning, before most tour stops, the band could be heard making special appearances on the local radio stations (most included an interview and two to three songs). Red Wanting Blue also performed on [[The Rock Boat]] in March as well as several shows with friends and fellow musicians [[Carbon Leaf]]. On June 29, 2012 RWB's live concert attendance record was broken in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Over 9,000 people attended the outdoor concert dubbed \"Red Wanting Blue - Rocking on the River\" in support of the band. On April 13, \"Unraveled\", the film that features RWB's \"Magic Man\", was released theatrically (later debuting on [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] on August 8.) On July 10, the band made available a free download of their concert from NYC venue City Winery.\n\nOn July 18, Red Wanting Blue made their network television debut on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]]<ref name=\"Tribune06072012\" /> performing the song \"Audition\" to an audience that roared and cheered along. On Sept 17th RWB performed their debut session on Daytrotter.com. On October 1, 2012, the band announced they would be performing and appearing live on [[VH1]]'s morning show \"Big Morning Buzz Live\" on October 16 at 10am alongside [[Bruno Mars]] and [[Jason Aldean]]. On November 5 Red Wanting Blue performed live on the [[NPR]] radio program [[Mountain Stage]] alongside [[Dr. Dog]] and [[The Mountain Goats]] at the Keith Albee Theater in West Virginia.\n\nIn early 2013, RWB headlined a tour of the west coast and continued to sell out shows throughout the Midwest and east coast. They also toured eastern Canada with [[The Trews]] and hit a major milestone by selling out [[The Bowery Ballroom]] in New York City. At ''The Bowery Ballroom'' on March 9, Red Wanting Blue announced that they would be heading back into the studio with producer/friend Jamie Candiloro throughout March and April 2013 to record their 10th album.\n\nThroughout March, April and May 2013, Red Wanting Blue returned to their recording studio (\"El Rancho Relaxo\" in Columbus, Ohio) with Jamie Candiloro to produce their tenth album. This had been the longest amount of time ever scheduled off the road (for the purpose of recording) in the band's career. In September, RWB announced their fall tour dates with longtime friend [[Will Hoge]]. Red Wanting Blue chose [[Swear and Shake]] to open several dates on this fall tour entitled \"The Dime Store Circus Tour\".\n\nIn February 2014 Red Wanting Blue officially sold out their first two-night stint at the House of Blues In Cleveland, Ohio. They performed their \"love songs\" on the February 14 concert in honor of Valentine's Day and performed their full rock and roll show on February 15. The band played several rare songs from their early albums during these concerts.\n\nOn February 22 the band set sail for their 3rd appearance on [[The Rock Boat]]. Red Wanting Blue played on the theatre and pool deck stages. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] was invited to perform at the \"Campfire Story Sessions\" where he performed solo with his ukulele and told the true stories behind the songs  \"Probably Nothing\", \"Jennifear\" and a never before performed song called \"Little America.\" Ken Block and Drew Copland (of [[Sister Hazel]]), Emerson Hart (of [[Tonic (band)|Tonic]]) and [[Edwin McCain]] sang harmony on \"Jennifear\" as Scott Terry expressed several times how honored he was to be in their company.\n\n===''Little America'' (2014 \u2013 2016)===\nOn July 1, 2014, Red Wanting Blue released their tenth studio album titled ''Little America''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Chart and No.&nbsp;31 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock Chart. The album was recorded in Columbus, Ohio and Los Angeles, California, produced by Jamie Candiloro and mastered by Greg Calbi at Sterling Sound in NYC. Guest appearances include [[Ed Kowalczyk]] (of [[Live (band)]]), Kerri Spieler (of [[Swear and Shake]]) and Tim Hanseroth (of [[Brandi Carlile]]). A music video was released for the single ''You Are My Las Vegas'' starring the band member's real-life mothers. In the video, the moms physically transform into their sons (beards and all) and perform the song in character.\n\nTo celebrate the release of ''Little America'', RWB hit the road with longtime friends [[The Alternate Routes]]. The ''Sounds Like Summer U.S. Tour'' started in July 2014. In November, 2014 ''RWB'' hit the road with New Orleans band [[The Revivalists]] for a tour of the east coast and midwest. On Dec 4, 2014, ''Red Wanting Blue'' performed a special concert at [[Trinity Cathedral (Cleveland, Ohio)|Trinity Cathedral]] in Cleveland, Ohio. The performance consisted of both acoustic and electric sets and was recorded for the Cathedral Concert Series for [[PBS]] (rumored to air in March 2015).\n\nIn January, 2015, the band set sail to perform on the floating music festival ''Cayamo'' that featured [[John Prine]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Brandi Carlile]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[The Lone Bellow]], and more. Directly after ''Cayamo'', the band boarded ''The Rock Boat XV'' for their fourth consecutive year. The band performed alongside hosts [[Sister Hazel]], [[Barenaked Ladies]], longtime friends [[Alternate Routes]], [[Will Hoge]], and more. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] hosted the popular Rock Boat Songwriter Sessions and performed two brand new songs titled \"Holy Rolling Thunder\" and \"No Place To Go But Down\".\n\n''RWB'' hit the road in the spring/summer of 2015 on a tour called \"Our Little America Tour\". The tour began in Northwest Canada and ended in Boston. During this time they shared the stage with friends [[The Trews]] and [[The Alternate Routes]]. They debuted two new songs during this tour titled \"High and Dry\" and \"Holy Rolling Thunder\".\n\n===''RWB20 Live at Lincoln Theater'' (since 2016)===\n\nThis live concert film was recorded live at the Lincoln Theater in [[Columbus, Ohio]] on October 14, 2016. The double disc ''RWB20'' film and album was released only two months later, on December 16, 2016. The film was directed by ''Jenna Pace'' and the album was produced by ''Greg Rahm''. The film's purpose was to celebrate the first 20 years of ''Red Wanting Blue''. The concert started with a brand new song and proceeded to go back in time, playing re-worked versions of songs dating back to 1996.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"3\"\n|-\n!

The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}} It reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA Victor record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13\u201315}} In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, \"especially on legal documents\".{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's Outstanding Young Men used Aaron.

Known as the \"'''King of Rock and Roll'''\", he is regarded as [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century]]. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a [[civil rights movement|transformative era in race relations]], brought both great success and [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley#Danger to American culture|initial controversy]].\n\nPresley was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]; his family relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when he was 13. His music career began there in 1954, at [[Sun Records]] with producer [[Sam Phillips]], who wanted to bring the sound of [[African-American music]] to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill Black]], was a pioneer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. In 1955, drummer [[D. J. Fontana]] joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and [[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who managed him for the rest of his life. Presley's first RCA Victor single, \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the US. Within a year, RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular [[rock and roll]]; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans<ref name=\":00\" /> led to him being widely considered a [[moral panic|threat]] to the moral well-being of [[White Americans|white American]] youth.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=55}}\n\nIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''. Drafted into [[Military career of Elvis Presley|military service in 1958]], he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley's most famous films included ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' (1957), ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' (1961), and ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. However, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his [[Graceland]] estate at the age of 42.\n\nPresley is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time, with sales estimated around 500&nbsp;million records worldwide.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=sales}} He was commercially successful in many genres, including [[Traditional pop|pop]], country, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, [[adult contemporary]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. He won three [[Grammy Awards]], received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] at age 36, and has been inducted into [[List of halls of fame inducting Elvis Presley|multiple music halls of fame]]. He holds several records, including the most [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and the most number-one singles by any act on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

I was very [[shyness|shy]] about it.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=23}}\n\nIn September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade. The following year, he began singing and playing his guitar at school. He was often teased as a \"trashy\" kid who played [[hillbilly music]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=23\u201326}} Presley was a devotee of [[Mississippi Slim (country singer)|Mississippi Slim]]'s radio show. He was described as \"crazy about music\" by Slim's younger brother, one of Presley's classmates.

By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=44, 46, 51}} He competed in Humes' Annual \"Minstrel\" Show in 1953, singing and playing \"[[Till I Waltz Again with You]]\", a recent hit for [[Teresa Brewer]]. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: <blockquote>I wasn't popular in school&nbsp;... I failed music\u2014only thing I ever failed.

He aimed to pay for studio time to record a two-sided [[acetate disc]]: \"[[My Happiness (popular song)|My Happiness]]\" and \"[[That's When Your Heartaches Begin]]\". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he \"sounded like\". Biographer [[Peter Guralnick]] argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=62\u201364}} In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun\u2014\"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\" and \"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\"\u2014but again nothing came of it.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=65}} Not long after, he failed an [[audition]] for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=77}} and another for the band of [[Eddie Bond]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=83}}\n{{Listen|type=speech|filename=That's All Right.ogg|title=\"That's All Right\" |description=Presley transformed not only the sound but the emotion of the song, turning what had been written as a \"lament for a lost love into a satisfied declaration of independence.\"{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=174}}}}\nPhillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=72}} In June, he acquired a demo recording by [[Jimmy Sweeney]] of a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist [[Scotty Moore|Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore]] and [[double bass|upright bass]] player [[Bill Black]], to work with Presley for a recording session.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=10\u201311}} The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's \"[[That's All Right]]\". Moore recalled, \"All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them.\" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=94\u201397}} Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey [[Dewey Phillips]] (no relation to Sam Phillips) played \"That's All Right\" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=43}} Listener interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100\u2013101}} During the next few days, the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song, [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\", again in a distinctive style and employing a [[jury rigging|jury-rigged]] [[Delay (audio effect)|echo effect]] that Sam Phillips dubbed \"slapback\". A single was pressed with \"That's All Right\" on the A-side and \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" on the reverse.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=102\u2013104}}\n\n==== Early live performances and RCA Victor contract ====\nThe trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=105, 139}} Later that month, they appeared at the [[Overton Park#Levitt Shell|Overton Park Shell]], with [[Slim Whitman]] headlining. Here Elvis pioneered \"[[Rubber legs|Rubber Legs]]\", his signature dance movement.{{sfn|Miller|2021}}{{sfn|Rodman|2013|p=151}} A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: His wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106, 108\u2013111}} Moore recalled, \"During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mic and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}\n\nSoon after, Moore and Black left their old band to play with Presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter [[Bob Neal (promoter)|Bob Neal]] became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue in Memphis. When Presley played, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house [[western swing]] band resumed.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=139}} Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, \"His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=119}} Amid these live performances, Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=117\u2013127, 131}} Presley made what would be his only appearance on [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on October 2; ''Opry'' manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was \"not bad\" but did not suit the program.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=128\u2013130}}{{sfn|Mason|2007|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n==== ''Louisiana Hayride'', radio commercial, and first television performances ====\nIn November 1954, Presley performed on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''\u2014the ''Opry''{{'}}s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. His nervous first set drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=127\u2013128, 135\u2013142}} Soon after the show, the ''Hayride'' engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8, he purchased a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] instrument for $175 ({{Inflation|US|175|1954|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) and his trio began playing in new locales, including [[Houston]], Texas, and [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], Arkansas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=152, 156, 182}} Presley made his first television appearance on the [[KSLA-TV]] broadcast of ''Louisiana Hayride''. Soon after, he failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on the [[CBS]] television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular ''Hayride'' appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167\u2013168}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6\u201312}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley - TV Radio Mirror, September 1956 01.jpg|thumb|230px|Presley performing with [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] in 1956]]\nIn January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of [[Colonel Tom Parker]], whom he considered the best promoter in the music business.

Some of the songs, like \"That's All Right\", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the \"R&B idiom of negro field jazz\"; others, like \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", were \"more in the country field\", \"but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=163}} This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because \"he sounded too much like a [[hillbilly]].\"{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=104}} The blend came to be known as \"rockabilly\". At the time, Presley was billed as \"The King of Western Bop\", \"The Hillbilly Cat\", and \"The Memphis Flash\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=53}}\n\nPresley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=45}} The group maintained an extensive touring schedule.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=29}} Neal recalled, \"It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys.

There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him.\"{{sfn|Rogers|1982|p=41}} The trio became a quartet when ''Hayride'' drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of [[Bill Haley]], whose \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=217\u2013219}}\n\nAt the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=31}} After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with [[RCA Victor]] on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28\u201329}}{{refn|Of the $40,000, $5,000 covered back royalties owed by Sun.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28\u201329}}|name=royalties|group=lower-alpha}} Presley, aged 20, was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract.{{sfn|Escott|1998|p=421}} Parker arranged with the owners of [[Hill & Range]] Publishing, [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley.

The program, produced in New York City, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dorsey]]. After his first appearance on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victor's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a [[cover song|cover]] of [[Carl Perkins]]' rockabilly anthem \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\". In February, Presley's \"[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget]]\", a Sun recording released the previous August, reached the top of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country chart]].{{sfn|Slaughter|Nixon|2004|p=21}} Neal's contract was terminated and Parker became Presley's manager.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=50, 54, 64}}\n\nRCA Victor released Presley's [[Elvis Presley (album)|self-titled debut album]] on March 23.

As described by Hilburn, these <blockquote>were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists&nbsp;... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.{{sfn|Hilburn|2005}}</blockquote> It became the first rock and roll album to top the ''Billboard'' chart, a position it held for ten weeks.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Chuck Berry]], cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, \"of Elvis having the time of his life on stage ''with a guitar in his hands'' played a crucial role in positioning the guitar&nbsp;... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.\"{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=28}}\n\n==== ''Milton Berle Show'' and \"Hound Dog\" ====\n[[File:Elvis signs autographs in Minneapolis 1956.jpg|thumb|left|Presley signing autographs in [[Minneapolis]] in 1956]]\nOn April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''.

The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the \"biggest pop craze\" since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]&nbsp; and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: <blockquote>As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed.&nbsp;...

Also known as ''Welcome Home Elvis'', the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=44, 62\u201363}}\n\n''[[G.I. Blues (album)|G.I.

His first LP of sacred material, ''[[His Hand in Mine]]'', followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for twenty-four local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 114}} A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, ''[[Something for Everybody]]''.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=148}} According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the [[Nashville sound]], the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley over the next half-decade, the album is largely \"a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis' birthright\".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=52}} It would be his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven years.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 119}}\n\n==== Lost in Hollywood ====\nParker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted [[musical comedy|musical comedies]]. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein\u2014''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960) and ''[[Wild in the Country]]'' (1961)\u2014were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=133}} His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a \"pantheon of bad taste\".{{sfn|Caine|2005|p=21}} Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. [[Hal Wallis]], who produced nine, declared, \"A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood.\"{{sfn|Fields|2007}}\n\nOf Presley's films in the 1960s, fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules\u2014Presley frequently starred in three a year\u2014affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: \"three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}} As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew \"progressively worse\".{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=67}} [[Julie Parrish]], who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'' (1966), says that Presley disliked many of the songs.{{sfn|Lisanti|2000|pp=19, 136}} The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone: \"The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=201}} Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]]. But by and large, according to biographer [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]], the numbers seemed to be \"written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=32}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley and Priscilla with Lisa Marie February 1968.jpg|thumb|274x274px|Presley and his wife, [[Priscilla Presley]], holding their newborn daughter, [[Lisa Marie Presley]], in 1968]]\nIn the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as \"[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]\" (1961) and \"[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]\" (1962). However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: \"[[Crying in the Chapel]]\" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967). It won him his first [[Grammy Award]], for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was \"arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs\".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=650}}\n\nShortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the [[Aladdin (hotel and casino)|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=261\u2013263}} The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks continued. It was not until October 1967, when the [[Clambake (soundtrack)|''Clambake'' soundtrack LP]] registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA Victor executives recognized a problem. \"By then, of course, the damage had been done\", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. \"Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans.\"{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=73}}\n\n=== 1968\u20131973: Comeback ===\n==== ''Elvis'': the '68 Comeback Special ====\n{{Main|Singer Presents...Elvis}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley 68 Comeback Special.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Presley, wearing a tight black leather jacket with Napoleonic standing collar, black leather wristbands, and black leather pants, holds a microphone with a long cord.

Parker had already shifted his plans to television: he maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=4}}\n\nRecorded in late June in [[Burbank, California]], the special, simply called ''Elvis'', aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience\u2014Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer [[Steve Binder]] worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=293, 296}} The show, NBC's highest-rated that season, captured forty-two percent of the total viewing audience.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} [[Jon Landau]] of ''Eye'' magazine remarked: <blockquote>There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made [[Jim Morrison]] green with envy.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}}</blockquote> Marsh calls the performance one of \"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=649}}\n\nBy January 1969, the single \"[[If I Can Dream]]\", written for the special, reached number 12. The [[NBC-TV Special|soundtrack album]] rose into the top ten. According to friend [[Jerry Schilling]], the special reminded Presley of what \"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.&nbsp;... He was out of prison, man.\"{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} Binder said of Presley's reaction, \"I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life.

Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is \"a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=396}} The album featured the hit single \"[[In the Ghetto]]\", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart\u2014Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since \"Bossa Nova Baby\" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\", \"[[Don't Cry Daddy]]\", and \"[[Kentucky Rain]]\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=419}}\n\nPresley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the ''Comeback Special'', offers came in from around the world. The [[London Palladium]] offered Parker {{US$|28,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|28000|1969|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) for a one-week engagement. He responded, \"That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?\"{{sfn|Gordon|2005|p=146}} In May, the brand-new [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, booked Presley for fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist [[James Burton]] and including two gospel groups, [[The Imperials]] and [[Sweet Inspirations]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=283}} Costume designer [[Bill Belew]], responsible for the intense leather styling of the ''Comeback Special'', created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by his passion for karate.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=343}} Nonetheless, Presley was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker oversaw a major promotional push, and International Hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]] arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=346\u2013347}}\n\nPresley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" (which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life).{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=149\u2013150}} At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as \"The King\", Presley gestured toward [[Fats Domino]], who was taking in the scene. \"No,\" Presley said, \"that's the real king of rock and roll.\"{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=259, 262}} ''[[Newsweek]]'' commented, \"There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.\"{{sfn|Moyer|2002|p=73}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Presley \"supernatural, his own resurrection.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=287}} In November, Presley's final non-concert film, ''[[Change of Habit]]'', opened. The double album ''[[From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis]]'' came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. \"Suspicious Minds\" reached the top of the charts\u2014Presley's first [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. pop number-one]] in over seven years, and his last.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|pp=521\u2013522}}\n\n[[Cassandra Peterson]], later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless {{US$|50,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|50000|1970|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=253}} The FBI took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows.

As music historian John Robertson noted, <blockquote>The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop\u2014perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=70}}</blockquote> After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the [[Southern United States|South]], his first since 1958.

Twice during the year he overdosed on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. In late 1973, he was hospitalized from the effects of a [[pethidine]] addiction. According to his primary care physician, [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley \"felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street\".{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=238}} Despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=481, 487, 499, 504, 519\u2013520}}\n\nPresley's condition declined precipitously that September.

The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered \"[[anaphylactic shock]] brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy\". Lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that [[polypharmacy]] was the primary cause of death; one reported \"fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=651\u2013653}} In 1979, forensic pathologist [[Cyril Wecht]] reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of [[depressant]]s had resulted in Presley's accidental death.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Forensic historian and pathologist [[Michael Baden]] viewed the situation as complicated: \"Elvis had  an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] for a long time.

It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}\n\nIn 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as [[Miami-Dade County]] coroner,{{sfn|Tennant|2013|p=2}} declared at its completion, \"There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack.\"{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff \"could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then.\"{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=11\u201314}} One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, <blockquote>could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached.&nbsp;... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body&nbsp;... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with [[diabetes]], glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs.

Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=211}} and, as Stoller put it, \"He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.\"{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, \"I know practically every religious song that's ever been written.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}}\n\n=== Musicianship ===\nPresley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear.{{sfn|Graceland Blog|2015}} Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA Victor albums.

In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP ''[[Peace in the Valley (EP)|Peace in the Valley]]''. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=14}} Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Run On.ogg|title=\"Run On\" |description=From ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967), a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition.

His first post-Army single, the number-one hit \"Stuck on You\", is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its \"mild rock beat\"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it \"upbeat pop\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=123}} The number five \"[[She's Not You]]\" (1962) \"integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop\".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}} The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on ''Elvis Is Back!'' was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966\u201367 recordings as \"[[Down in the Alley (The Clovers song)|Down in the Alley]]\" and \"[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=213, 237}} Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", a number-one in 1960. \"It's Now or Never\", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song \"{{lang|nap|[['O sole mio]]|italic=no}}\" and concluding with a \"full-voiced operatic cadence\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=65}} These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\nWhile Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become \"hard to find\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=343}} A significant exception was \"Burning Love\", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and [[funk]]. Much of ''Elvis in Memphis'', as well as \"Suspicious Minds\", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=199}}\n\n=== Vocal style and range ===\n[[File:Elvis Presley first national television appearance 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Publicity photo of Elvis playing guitar|Publicity photo for the [[CBS]] program ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage Show]]'', January 16, 1956]]\n\nThe developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from \"high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=234}} Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the \"vocal stutter\" on 1955's \"[[Baby Let's Play House]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=317}} When on \"Don't Be Cruel\", Presley \"slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses,\" he shows \"how masterful his relaxed style really is.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=91}} Marsh describes the vocal performance on \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" as one of \"gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing\", with the line {{\"'}}Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=490}}\n\nJorgensen calls the 1966 recording of \"How Great Thou Art\" \"an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions\", as Presley \"crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax\", becoming \"a kind of one-man quartet\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=212}} Guralnick finds \"[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand by Me]]\" from the same gospel sessions \"a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance\", but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on \"Where No One Stands Alone\", resorting \"to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound\" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, \"he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=232}} Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: \"The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=231}}\n\nMarsh praises his 1968 reading of \"[[U.S. Male]]\", \"bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=424}} The performance on \"In the Ghetto\" is, according to Jorgensen, \"devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms\", instead relying on the exceptional \"clarity and sensitivity of his voice\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=271}} Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of \"almost translucent eloquence&nbsp;... so quietly confident in its simplicity\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=332}} On \"Suspicious Minds\", Guralnick hears essentially the same \"remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise\", but supplemented with \"an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=335}}\n\nMusic critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] observes that \"Presley has been described variously as a [[baritone]] and a [[tenor]]. An extraordinary compass&nbsp;... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion.\"{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two [[octave]]s and a third, \"from the baritone low [[G (musical note)|G]] to the tenor high [[B (musical note)|B]], with an upward extension in [[falsetto]] to at least a D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down.\"{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} In Pleasants' view, his voice was \"variable and unpredictable\" at the bottom, \"often brilliant\" at the top, with the capacity for \"full-voiced high Gs and [[A (musical note)|As]] that an opera baritone might envy\".{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that \"his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all.\"{{sfn|Waters|2003|p=205}} Presley was always \"able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers\", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}\n\n== Public image ==\n=== Relationship with the African-American community ===\n[[File:BillyWard n Elvis Presley circa 1955.jpg|thumb|Elvis Presley and [[Billy Ward (singer)|Billy Ward]], circa 1955]]\nWhen Dewey Phillips first aired \"That's All Right\" on Memphis' [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]], many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100\u2013101}} From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician [[Arthur Crudup]]\u2014the originator of \"That's All Right\"\u2014\"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} ''The Memphis World'', an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley \"cracked Memphis' segregation laws\" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its \"colored night\".{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} In contrast, many white adults \"did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.\"<ref name=\":00\" />\n\nDespite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had announced, \"The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes.\" A journalist with the national African American weekly ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'', Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of ''Jailhouse Rock'', Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: <blockquote>I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it.&nbsp;... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that.{{sfn|Williams|2012}}</blockquote> Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Blues singer [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland, reported of Presley, \"He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=426}} Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}}\n\nThe persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music still found adherents.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ushe |first1=Naledi |title=Appropriation or appreciation?

Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, \"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that.

But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force.&nbsp;... Elvis' breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.{{sfn|New York Times|2002}}</blockquote>\n\nHe was ranked third on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of greatest artists. [[Bono]] wrote in appreciation: <blockquote>In Elvis, you have the blueprint for rock & roll. The highness \u2014 the gospel highs. The mud \u2014 the Delta mud, the blues. Sexual liberation. Controversy. Changing the way people feel about the world. It's all there with Elvis.{{sfn|Bono|2010|loc=\"Elvis\"}}</blockquote>\n\n Not only Presley's achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:<blockquote>Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.&nbsp;... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.&nbsp;... Elvis has emerged as a great ''artist'', a great ''rocker'', a great ''purveyor of schlock'', a great ''heart throb'', a great ''bore'', a great ''symbol of potency'', a great ''ham'', a great ''nice person'', and, yes, a great American.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=141\u2013142}}</blockquote>\n\n== Achievements ==\nHaving sold about 500 million records worldwide, Presley is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=sales|The estimates of Elvis Presley's record sales vary from 500 million \u2013 1 billion records worldwide.{{sfn|Reuters|2022}}<ref>{{cite book|title= Brandstorm: Surviving and Thriving in the New Consumer-Led Marketplace|publisher=[[ Macmillan Publishers]]|page=77|author=Liz Nickles, Savita Iyer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/14/us/elvis-presley-1968-comeback-guitar-auction/index.html|title= An iconic guitar from Elvis Presley's Comeback Special is up for auction|date=14 March 2021|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>}} Presley's rankings for top ten and number-one hits vary depending on how the double-sided \"Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel\" and \"Don't/I Beg of You\" singles, which precede the inception of ''Billboard''{{'}}s unified [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, are analyzed.{{refn|Whitburn follows actual ''Billboard'' history in considering the four songs on the \"Don't Be Cruel/Hound Dog\" and \"Don't/I Beg of You\" singles as distinct.

''Billboard'' now considers both singles as unified items, ignoring the historical sales split of the former and its old Top 100 chart entirely. Whitburn thus analyzes the four songs as yielding three number ones and a total of four top tens.

Nicknamed \"'''The Killer'''\", he was described as \"[[rock 'n' roll]]'s first great wild man\". A pioneer of rock and roll and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studio in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. \"[[Crazy Arms]]\" sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but it was his 1957 hit \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\" that shot Lewis to worldwide fame. He followed this with the major hits \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", \"[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]\", and \"[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]\".\n\nHis rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old first cousin once removed. His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into [[country music]] and had hits with songs such as \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country and Western Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Myers |first=Marc |date=October 24, 2014 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis, the Enduring Rebel of Rock 'n' Roll |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |website=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=March 8, 2017 |archive-date=March 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321082649/https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |url-status=live }}</ref> His No. 1 country hits included \"[[To Make Love Sweeter for You]]\", \"[[There Must Be More to Love Than This (song)|There Must Be More to Love Than This]]\", \"[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]\", and \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\".\n\nLewis's successes continued throughout the decades, and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of [[The Big Bopper]]'s \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" and [[Mack Vickery]]'s \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continued to tour worldwide and released new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was his best-selling release, with over a million copies worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, another of his bestselling albums.\n\nLewis had a dozen [[Music recording certification|gold records]] in rock and country. He won four Grammy awards, including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and two [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Awards. Lewis was inducted into the inaugural class of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre was recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memphis Music Hall of Fame |url=http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |access-date=October 12, 2016 |website=Memphismusichalloffame.com |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009220210/http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2022.

He grew up in an impoverished farming family in Eastern Louisiana. In his youth, he began playing the piano with two of his cousins, [[Mickey Gilley]] (later a popular country music singer) and [[Jimmy Swaggart]] (later a popular televangelist). His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, [[Carl McVoy]] (who later recorded with [[Bill Black]]'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney's Big House, a black [[juke joint]] across the tracks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 16, 2004 |title=Natchez Under The Hill Saloon \u2013 Natchez Mississippi |url=http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716210854/http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |archive-date=July 16, 2004 |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Underthehillsaloon.com}}</ref> On November 19, 1949, Lewis made his first public performance of his career, playing with a [[country and western]] band at a car dealership in Ferriday.

When Lewis daringly played a [[boogie-woogie]] rendition of \"My God Is Real\" at a church assembly, it ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some \"worldly\" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them.

In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for other Sun artists, including [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's \"[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]\", \"[[Your True Love]]\", and \"Put Your Cat Clothes On\" and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s \"Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll\".\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano.

In 2005, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]].

The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, \"Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless centre of the very best rock & roll...\" The album showcases Lewis's skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that \"''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg'' is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion.\"\n\n===Country comeback===\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Carl Perkins]] on ''The Johnny Cash Christmas Special'' in November 1977]]\nFrustrated by Smash's inability to score a hit, Lewis was planning on leaving the label when promotions manager [[Eddie Kilroy]] pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the [[Jerry Chesnut]] song \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing [[Iago]] in a rock and roll adaptation of ''Othello'' called ''Catch My Soul'' in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer [[Jerry Kennedy]]. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have predicted, although country music always remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation ''Killer Country'', the conversion to country music in 1968 \"looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by countless country records starting with his first, '[[Crazy Arms]]', in 1956.\" The last time Lewis had had a song on the country charts was with \"Pen and Paper\" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but \"Another Place, Another Time\" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart-toppers. Hits include \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)\", \"To Make Love Sweeter For You\", \"She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)\", \"Since I Met You Baby\", \"Once More With Feeling\", \"One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)\", and \"Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough\". The production on his early country albums, such as ''[[Another Place, Another Time (album)|Another Place, Another Time]]'' and ''She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye'', was sparse, quite different from the slick \"[[Nashville sound]]\" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as [[George Jones]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. In his book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording \"were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio\".\n\nIn a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer [[Shelby Singleton]], who purchased [[Sun Records]] from [[Sam Phillips]] in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his later unreleased Sun recordings, \"[[One Minute Past Eternity]]\", was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] hit \"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye\". Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following ''The Golden Cream of the Country'' with ''[[A Taste of Country]]'' later in 1970.\n\n===Grand Ole Opry appearance===\nLewis played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] only once, on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to ''A Half Century of Hits'', he had maintained an ambivalence to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Music City]] ever since he was turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at [[Sun Records]]: \"It was 18 years since he had left [[Nashville]] broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn't move there and didn't [[schmooze]] there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different.\"<ref name=\"Escott\"/>\n\nAs recounted in a 2015 online ''Rolling Stone'' article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\". Ignoring his allotted time constraints\u2014and, thus, commercial breaks\u2014Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited [[Del Wood]]\u2014the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager\u2014out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\", \"Workin' Man Blues\", \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\", and a number of other classics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dunkerly, Beville |date=January 20, 2015 |title=Flashback: Jerry Lee Lewis Drops an F-Bomb on the Grand Ole Opry |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |access-date=September 30, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-date=October 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021172629/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===''The Session'' and ''Southern Roots''===\n[[File:JerryLee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis performing in 1977]]\nLewis returned to the pop charts with \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\" in 1971 and \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" in 1972, and this, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage [[rock and roll]], inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of British and Irish musicians, including [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Kenney Jones]], and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut \"Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" was the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. ''The Session'' was his highest pop charting album since 1964's ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that year, he went to Memphis and recorded ''[[Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis]]'', a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. According to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, \"the Killer\" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to record: \"During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog.\" During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue ''Southern Roots: The Original Sessions'', Meaux asks Lewis, \"Do you wanna try one?\", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, \"If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Little |first=Michael H. |date=September 29, 2020 |title=Graded on a Curve: Jerry Lee Lewis, Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis |url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |access-date=March 22, 2021 |website=The Vinyl District |archive-date=January 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115110247/http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was \"Middle Age Crazy\", which made it to number 4 in 1977.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis @ Credicard Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Lewis performing in 2009]]\nIn 1979, Lewis switched record labels to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and produced the critically acclaimed ''Jerry Lee Lewis'', although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was incorporated into all future events. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''.\n\nIn 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called \"It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)\" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on the radio. The public downfall of his cousin, [[televangelist]] [[Jimmy Swaggart]] around the same time, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts.

Lewis had a recorded argument with [[Sam Phillips]] during the recording session for \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous (\"How can... How can the devil save souls? What are you ''talkin' about''?\" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous [[Million Dollar Quartet]] jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer [[Rick Bragg]] explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because \"only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the [[Assemblies of God|Assembly of God]]\", and {{\"'}}Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words... they was [[Baptists]]', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bragg |first=Rick |author-link=Rick Bragg |date=October\u2013November 2014 |title=Jerry Lee and Me |url=http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |url-status=dead |journal=[[Garden & Gun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073447/http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |archive-date=November 21, 2015 |access-date=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990 documentary ''The Jerry Lee Lewis Story'', Lewis said to the interviewer, \"The Bible doesn't even speak of religion.

I find myself falling short of the glory of God.\"\n\nGospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire.

Later that night, Lewis was at a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] nightclub called the Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new [[Lincoln Continental]] with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.\n\nPresley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but \"Elvis, watching on the [[closed-circuit television]], told guards to call the police. The [[Memphis police]] found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs.\" Lewis said, \"The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me \u2013 knowin' me the way he did \u2013 was ridiculous.\" Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world.

He has made numerous recordings, primarily in the [[rockabilly]] genre but also has a large body of recorded work in [[rock 'n' roll]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]], and [[country music]]. He performed live primarily in the [[Washington, D.C.]], area, but also played regularly at European roots music festivals.\n\n==Early life==\nHancock was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and raised in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], where he has lived most of his life.  He attended George Washington High School in Alexandria, graduating in 1964. He came from a musical family. His maternal grandmother Katie sang with Minstrel shows in black face accompanying herself on piano and harmonica. Two of his aunts Eileen and Anita were a singing duo in the 1940s who sang at two or three Washington DC radios stations on a regular basis. His paternal grandfather Mitchell (Mitch) Hancock played mandolin from about 1897 until 1902. He often played on River Boats in New Orleans and recorded for the Edison Label. Billy's father worked for the Southern Railway and his mother worked for Waxie Maxie's, a local record store chain, and other record stores. The records his mother brought home from work, primarily rhythm and blues from the late 1940s, played a large and influential role in his musical development.\n\n==Career==\nHancock began his career playing in bands around Washington, D.C., while still a teenager. After graduating from high school, he played with bands in [[Rhode Island]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] before returning to the Washington area. In 1968, he moved to [[Baltimore]] to attend the [[Peabody Conservatory]], and continued to play in bands in the Baltimore area.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hancock began a collaboration with [[Danny Gatton]] and they formed Danny and the Fat Boys with Hancock (bass, vocals), Gatton (guitars), and Dave Elliott (drums, vocals). In 1975, the group released ''American Music'' on a label owned by Hancock and his brother. The album's title was taken from a rhythm and blues song Hancock had written. It was later re-issued on CD.\n\nIn 1978, Hancock recorded four rockabilly songs under the name Billy Hancock and the Tennessee Rockets for [[Ripsaw Records]], a small independent label. He continued to record rockabilly for Ripsaw under that name for two years. Ripsaw released four singles during that time and licensed those and other titles to larger labels both in the U.S. and France. It is these rockabilly recordings for which Hancock is known internationally.\n\nIn 1983, Hancock recorded another rockabilly record, \"Hey! Little Rock And Roller\", that was released in France on the Big Beat Label. Later that year, he returned to Ripsaw to record various rock and roll songs, six of which Ripsaw released in 1985. All of the Ripsaw material was later released on CDs by Finnish Bluelight Records.\n\nThroughout his career, Hancock played in backing bands for prominent musicians, including [[Fats Domino]], [[Gene Vincent]], blues guitarist [[Roy Buchanan]], rockabilly [[Charlie Feathers]], [[the Clovers]], [[Amos Milburn]], and country musicians [[Dottie West]] and [[Jean Shepard]]. He co-produced and played guitar on [[Tex Rubinowitz]]'s rockabilly song \"Hot Rod Man.\"\n\nIn 2002, Hancock and his brother the television director, Dale Hancock founded Turkey Mountain Records, an independent record label. The label was formed to find and promote talented artists of all genres who, for whatever reasons, have been ignored by other record labels. Their Archival Series re-released material on artists of the past whose works have been unavailable until now. Turkey Mountain Records' roster of artists included: Danny Gatton, The British Walkers (featuring Roy Buchanan), Bobbie (The Kid) Howard with Link Wray and The Ray Men, Charlie Feathers, The Fallen Angels, and Billy Hancock himself.\n\nIn 2005, the [[Washington Area Music Association]] WAMA awarded Hancock a Special Recognition Award for his 40-plus years as a vocalist, musician, songwriter, producer, promoter, and label owner. In 2006, WAMA presented him with two \"Wammie\" awards for 2005 Roots Rock Vocalist and Roots Rock Recording.  In 2012, WAMA presented Hancock as one of \"The Fallen Angels\" a special recognition award.\n\nIn 2010, Hancock was inducted into the Southern Legends Hall of Fame. He is already a member of three other International Halls of Fame.\n\nHancock was also the television host for ''American Music'' in Arlington, Virginia, where he interviewed and showcased songwriters and a music historian.\n\nHe was also a member of the resurrected art rock group from the sixties, The Fallen Angels.\n\nOn 4 November 2012 Hancock was inducted into The Northern Virginia Blues Society, Blues Hall of Fame in Manassas, Va.\n\n==Discography==\n*1975 - ''American Music''\n*1981 - ''Rockabilly Fever''\n*1981 - ''Shakin' That Rockabilly Fever''\n*1983 - ''Hey!

His songs, such as \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\", \"[[Summertime Blues]]\", \"[[C'mon Everybody]]\" and \"[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]\", captured teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s and early 1960s.<ref name=\"RRHOF\">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Eddie Cochran: Hall of Fame Essay|work=Inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|location=Cleveland, Ohio|year=1987|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/eddie-cochran/|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Cochran experimented with [[multitrack recording]], distortion techniques, and [[overdubbing]], even on his earliest singles.<ref name=Cochran2003>{{cite book|last1=Cochran|first1=Bobby|author-link=Bobby Cochran|last2=Van Hecke|first2=Susan|title=Three Steps to Heaven: The Eddie Cochran Story|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|year=2003|isbn=978-0634032523}}</ref> Cochran played the guitar, piano, bass, and drums.<ref name=RRHOF/> His image as a sharply dressed and attractive young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the 1950s rocker, and in death, Cochran achieved iconic status.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Eddie Cochran Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2020|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-cochran-mn0000793988/biography|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCochran was involved with music from an early age, playing in the school band and teaching himself to play blues guitar.<ref name=Cochran2003/> In 1955, Cochran formed a duo with the guitarist [[Hank Cochran]] (no relation) and became known as the Cochran Brothers. When they split the following year, Eddie began a song-writing career with [[Jerry Capehart]]. His first success came when he performed the song \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" in the film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'', starring [[Jayne Mansfield]]. Soon afterward, he signed a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] and his first record for the label, \"[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]\", rose to number 18 on the [[Billboard charts]].\n\nCochran died at the age of 21 in St Martin's Hospital, [[Bath, Somerset]], after a car accident in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]], at the end of his British tour with [[Gene Vincent]] in April 1960.  On April 16, after they had just performed at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]], on their way to their next venue, Vincent, Cochran and the songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]] were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi. The other two passengers survived with major injuries, but Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day.\n\nThough Cochran's best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. His songs have been recorded by a wide variety of recording artists. [[Paul McCartney]] himself chose Cochran's \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" as his audition piece, assured to impress [[John Lennon]] by his performance of it, which he did and was hired as a member of Lennon's [[skiffle]] group [[The Quarrymen]], which later was renamed [[The Beatles]].\n\n==Early life==\nCochran was born on October 3, 1938, in [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]], to Alice and Frank R. Cochran. He was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.<ref name=\"Cochran2003\" /> Cochran's parents were from Oklahoma. Cochran took music lessons in school but quit the band to play drums. Additionally, rather than taking piano lessons, he began learning guitar, playing country and other music he heard on the radio.\n\nIn 1952, Cochran's family moved to [[Bell Gardens, California]]. As his guitar playing improved, Cochran formed a band with two friends from his junior high school. In January 1955, Cochran dropped out of [[Bell Gardens High School]] in his first year to become a professional musician.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web |year=2020 |title=Eddie Cochran Biography |url=https://www.gretschguitars.com/features/eddie-cochran |access-date=April 14, 2020 |work=Featured Pages |publisher=Gretsch Guitars |location=Savannah, Georgia}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n=== The Cochran Brothers (1955\u20131956) ===\n[[File:The Cochran Brothers.jpg|thumb|The Cochran Brothers]]\nDuring a show featuring many performers at an [[American Legion]] hall, Cochran met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter.

In the spring of 1956, [[Boris Petroff]] asked Cochran if he would appear in the musical comedy film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956). Cochran agreed and performed the song \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" in the movie. In 1957, Cochran starred in his second film, ''[[Untamed Youth]]'' (1957), and had yet another hit, \"[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]\", one of the few songs he recorded that was written by other songwriters (in this case [[John D. Loudermilk]]). \"Twenty Flight Rock\" was written by AMI staff writer [[Ned Fairchild]] (a pen name\u2014her real name is Nelda Fairchild). Fairchild, who was not a rock and roll performer, merely provided the initial form of the song; the co-writing credit reflects Cochran's major changes and contributions to the final product.\n\n==== ''Singin' to My Baby'' (1957) ====\nIn the summer of 1957, [[Liberty Records]] issued Cochran's only studio album released during his lifetime, ''[[Singin' to My Baby]]''. The album included John D. Loudermilk's \"Sittin' in the Balcony\". For the album, Cochran worked with manager and songwriter [[Jerry Capehart]], and wrote the songs \"Completely Sweet\", \"Undying Love\", \"When I'm Mad\", and Cochran original \"One Kiss\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=1957 |title=Eddie Cochran With The Johnny Mann Orchestra And Chorus \u2013 Singin' To My Baby |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/290087-Eddie-Cochran-With-The-Johnny-Mann-Orchestra-And-Chorus-Singin-To-My-Baby |access-date=May 25, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Cochran seemed to find his stride in the famous teenage anthem \"[[Summertime Blues]]\" (co-written with Jerry Capehart). With this song, Cochran was established as one of the most important influences on rock and roll in the 1950s, both lyrically and musically. The song, released by [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] recording no. 55144, charted at number&nbsp;8 in 1958.\n\nOriginally, Cochran toured with [[The Kelly Four]] as his backing band, guitarist [[Mike Deasy]], saxophonist Mike Henderson, bassist [[Dave Shriver]], and drummer [[Gene Riggio]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Kelly Four Discography {{!}} Discogs |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2874069-The-Kelly-Four |access-date=May 27, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref> They were known as The Hollywood Swingers, a reference to [[Dick D'Agostin]]'s band. The line-up of Cochran's touring band would change overtime, with saxophonist [[Seals and Crofts|Jim Seals]] and bassist [[Connie 'Guybo' Smith]], and the addition of pianist [[Jim Stivers]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jimmy Seals session with Eddie Cochran |url=http://thompsonian.info/sealsec.html |access-date=2024-05-27 |website=thompsonian.info}}</ref> They were eventually joined by various members from Dick D'Agostin and The Swingers. In 1959, The Swingers line-up became [[Multi-instrumentalist|muti-instrumentalist]] with pianist Dick D'Agostin, pianist Jim Stivers (briefly on bass), guitarist [[Larry D'Agostin]], saxophonist [[Paul Kaufman]], and drummer Gene Riggio. However, D'Agostin left and was called-up to enlist into the U.S. Army. Members from The Kelly Four returned, Deasy and Henderson, with Stivers and Riggio being accompanied by bassist Don Meyer (later replaced by Dave Shriver). This was the last line-up of Cochran's touring band, returning to the name of The Kelly Four.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[File:C'mon, Everybody - Billboard ad 1958.jpg|thumb|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, December 15, 1958]]\n\nCochran starred in his last film ''[[Go, Johnny, Go!]]'' (1959).<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051665/ |title=Go, Johnny, Go!

The band was also known as '''Bill Haley and the Comets''' and '''Bill Haley's Comets'''. From late 1954 to late 1956, the group recorded nine Top 20 singles, one of which was number one and three that were Top Ten. The single \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" was the best-selling rock single in the history of the genre and maintained that position for several years.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bogdanov|first1=Vladimir|last2=Woodstra|first2=Chris|last3=Erlewine|first3=Stephen Tomas|date=2003|title=All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music|location=|publisher=Backbeat Books|page=315|isbn=0-87930-760-9}}</ref>\n\nBand leader [[Bill Haley]] had previously been a [[Western swing]] performer; after recording a [[rockabilly]] version of [[Ike Turner]] and his [[Kings of Rhythm]]'s \"[[Rocket 88]]\", one of the first rock and roll recordings, Haley changed his band's musical direction to rock music. They went on to record hit versions of \"[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]\", \"[[Shake, Rattle & Roll]]\", the aforementioned \"Rock Around the Clock\", \"Dim, Dim the Lights\", \"[[Rock-A-Beatin' Boogie]]\", \"Razzle-Dazzle\", \"[[See You Later, Alligator]]\", \"[[When the Saints Go Marching In|The Saints Rock 'N' Roll]]\" and \"[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]\". In 1956, the group appeared in two early rock and roll movies with disc jockey [[Alan Freed]]: ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]]''.\n\nThough the group was considered to be at the forefront of rock and roll during the genre's formative years, the arrival of more risqu\u00e9 acts such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Little Richard]] by 1956 led the more clean-cut Haley and his Comets to decline in popularity. Haley would remain popular in [[Europe]] and go on to have a comeback as a nostalgia act in the 1970s, along with many of his contemporaries. Following Haley's death, no fewer than seven different groups have existed under the Comets name, all claiming (with varying degrees of authority) to be the continuation of Haley's group. As of the end of 2014, four such groups were still performing in the United States and internationally.\n\n==Early history==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Comets Ed Sullivan 1955.jpg|thumb|Bill Haley and the Comets on the Ed Sullivan Show or Toast of the Town, Sunday, August 7, 1955, CBS, Hartford, Connecticut]] -->\nIn around the mid-1940s, Bill Haley performed with the Down Homers and formed a group called the Four Aces of Western Swing. The group that later became the Comets initially formed as \"Bill Haley and the Saddlemen\" {{Circa|1949}}\u20131952, and performed mostly country and western songs, though occasionally with a bluesy feel.

It sold well and was followed in 1952 by a cover of a 1940s [[rhythm and blues]] song called \"[[Rock the Joint]]\" for Holiday's sister company, [[Essex Records]].\n\nDuring those years however, Haley was considered one of the top cowboy yodelers in America. Many Saddlemen recordings were not released until the 1970s and 1980s, and highlights included romantic ballads such as \"Rose of My Heart\" and [[western swing]] tunes such as \"Yodel Your Blues Away.\" The original members of this group were Haley, pianist and accordion player [[Johnny Grande]] and [[steel guitar]]ist [[Billy Williamson (guitarist)|Billy Williamson]]. Al Thompson was the group's first bass player, followed by [[Al Rex]] and [[Marshall Lytle]]. During the group's early years, it recorded under several other names, including Johnny Clifton and His String Band and [[Reno Browne]] and Her Buckaroos (although Browne, a female matinee idol of the time, did not actually appear on the record).\n\n\"Rocket 88\", \"Rock the Joint\", and their immediate follow-ups were released under the increasingly incongruous Saddlemen name. It soon became apparent that a new name for the group was needed to fit the new musical style. A friend of Haley's, making note of the common mispronunciation of the name [[Halley's Comet]] to rhyme with ''Bailey'', suggested that Haley call his band the Comets. This event is cited in the Haley biographies ''Sound and Glory'' by John Haley and John von Hoelle; ''Bill Haley'' by John Swenson; and in ''Still Rockin' Around the Clock'', a memoir by Comets bass player Marshall Lytle.\n\nThe new name for the group was adopted in the fall of 1952, before the 1953 release of \"[[Crazy Man, Crazy]]\" which had some elements of [[rock and roll]] and [[rockabilly]] music.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/2135591-Bill-Haley-With-Haleys-Comets-Crazy-Man-Crazy|title=Bill Haley With Haley's Comets* \u2013 Crazy Man, Crazy|date=July 6, 2017|work=Discogs|access-date=November 10, 2023|quote=}}</ref> Members of the group at that time were Haley, Johnny Grande, Billy Williamson and Marshall Lytle. Grande usually played piano on records but switched to accordion for live shows as it was more portable than a piano and easier to deal with during musical numbers that involved a lot of dancing around.

Soon after, Haley asked Richards again, who then accepted the role. During this time (and as late as the fall of 1955), Haley did not have a permanent lead guitar player, choosing to use session musicians on records and either playing lead guitar himself or having Williamson play steel solos.\n\nEven before the release of more successful records, the group had achieved greatness in some respects: \"No one had blended country and R&B on a single before the Comets' \"Rock the Joint\". No one had scored an American Top 20 hit with anything that could really qualify as rock'n'roll before their single \"Crazy Man Crazy\" in 1953\".<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/22/bill-haley-rock-around-the-clock-worlds-first-rock-anthem|title=Bill Haley: Rock Around the Clock \u2013 the world's first rock anthem|date=May 22, 2014|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==National success and \"Rock Around the Clock\"==\n[[File:BillHaleyHankSnowTicket.jpg|thumb|Bill Haley/Elvis/Hank Snow Ticket \u2013 Oklahoma City newspaper ad. for Sunday October 16, 1955; two shows at the Municipal Auditorium.

[[Elvis Presley]] recorded the song in 1956, combining Haley's arrangement with Turner's original lyrics, but his version was not a substantial hit. Late in 1954, Haley recorded another hit, \"Dim, Dim The Lights\", which was one of the first R&B songs recorded by a white group to cross over to the R&B charts. [[Johnnie Ray]] had reached Number 1 with \"[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]\" in 1952.\n\nThe belated success of \"Rock Around the Clock\" is attributed to its use in the soundtrack of the film ''[[Blackboard Jungle]],''<ref name=pc5>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19751/m1/ |title=Show 5 \u2013 Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll: The Rock Revolution Gets Underway.

In late 1954, Haley and His Comets appeared in a [[short subject]] entitled ''Round Up of Rhythm'', performing three songs. This was the earliest known theatrical rock and roll film release.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0217775/|title=Round Up of Rhythm (1954) - IMDb|access-date=November 24, 2020|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BillHaley.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Bill Haley & His Comets in 1954. Left to right: Joey D'Ambrosio, Dick Richards, Bill Haley]]\nIn 1955, Lytle, Richards and Ambrose quit the Comets in a salary dispute and formed their own group, the [[The Jodimars|Jodimars]]. Haley hired several new musicians to take their place: [[Rudy Pompilli]] on sax, Al Rex (a former member of the Saddlemen) on double bass, and Ralph Jones on drums. In addition, lead guitarist [[Franny Beecher]], who had been a session musician for Haley since [[Danny Cedrone]]'s death in the spring of 1954, became a full-time Comet and Haley's first performing lead guitarist (Cedrone had played the guitar solo on the original recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" and died shortly after the recording session for \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" in the summer of 1954). This version of the band became more popular than the earlier manifestation and appeared in several [[motion pictures]] over the next few years.\n\nOther hits recorded by the band included \"[[See You Later, Alligator]]\"<ref name=pc5/> in which Haley's frantic delivery contrasted with the [[Louisiana]] languor of the original by [[Bobby Charles]], \"Don't Knock the Rock\", \"Rock-a-Beatin' Boogie\", \"Rudy's Rock\" (the first instrumental hit of the rock and roll era), and \"Skinny Minnie.\"\n\nBill Haley and the Comets performed \"Rock Around the Clock\" in an a cappella and a lip-synched version on the [[NBC]] television program ''[[Texaco Star Theater]]'' hosted by [[Milton Berle]] on May 31, 1955. Berle predicted that the song would go to Number 1, calling the band \"A group of entertainers who are going right to the top.\" Berle also sang and danced to the song, which was performed by the entire cast of the show. This was one of the earliest nationally televised performances by a rock and roll band and provided the new musical genre a much wider audience.\n\nBill Haley and the Comets were the first rock and roll performers to appear on the [[CBS]] television musical variety program ''The [[Ed Sullivan Show]], or Toast of the Town'' on Sunday, August 7, 1955, in a broadcast from the Shakespeare Festival Theater in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. They performed a live version of \"Rock Around the Clock\" featuring Franny Beecher on lead guitar and Dick Richards on drums. The group made a second and final appearance on the ''Ed Sullivan Show'' on Sunday, April 28, 1957, performing \"[[Rudy's Rock]]\" and \"Forty Cups of Coffee.\"\n\nBill Haley and the Comets appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television twice in 1957, on the prime-time show on October 28 and on the regular daytime show on November 27. The band also appeared on Dick Clark's ''Saturday Night Beechnut Show'' (also known as ''[[The Dick Clark Show]]''), a prime-time TV series from New York on March 22, 1958, during the first season (performing \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Ooh, Look-a There, Ain't She Pretty\") and on February 20, 1960 (performing \"Rock Around the Clock\" and \"Tamiami\").\n\nIn 1956, the group appeared in two of the earliest full-length rock and roll movies with [[Alan Freed]]: ''[[Rock Around the Clock (film)|Rock Around the Clock]]'' and ''[[Don't Knock the Rock]].'' The [[The Platters|Platters]] were co-stars in the first movie, and [[Little Richard]] appeared in the second. ''Rock Around the Clock'' was produced by Sam Katzman (who would produce several Elvis Presley films in the 1960s) and directed by Fred F. Sears.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article.html?isPreview=&id=1403164%7C184955&name=Rock-Around-the-Clock|title=&#124;Rock Around the Clock |website=Tcm.com|access-date=November 24, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Decline in popularity==\nThe band's popularity in the United States began to wane in 1956\u201357 as sexier, wilder acts such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Little Richard]] began to dominate the record charts (although Haley's cover version of Little Richard's \"[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]\", released in direct competition with Little Richard's original recording, outsold the original). After \"Skinny Minnie\" hit the charts in 1958, Haley had little further success in the United States, although a spin-off group made up of Comets musicians dubbed '''The Kingsmen''' (no relation to the later group of \"[[Louie, Louie]]\" fame) had a hit with an instrumental, \"Weekend\", that same year.\n\nOverseas, however, Haley and his band continued to be popular, touring the United Kingdom in February 1957, when Haley and his crew were mobbed by thousands of fans at [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] in London at an incident which the media dubbed the \"Second [[Battle of Waterloo]]\". The group also toured Australia in 1957, and in 1958 enjoyed a successful (if riot-dominated) tour of the European mainland. Bill Haley & His Comets were the first major American rock and roll act to tour the world in this way. Elvis, who was [[Elvis Presley's Army career|on military duty]] in Germany, visited them backstage at some shows. On a free day in Berlin they performed two songs in the [[Caterina Valente]] movie ''Hier Bin ich Hier Bleib Ich (Here I Am Here I Stay)''.\n\nBack in the U.S., Haley attempted to start his own record label, Clymax, and establish his own stable of performers, notably [[Sally Starr (TV hostess)|Sally Starr]] (the hostess of a Philadelphia television children's program) and the [[Matys Brothers]]. Members of the Comets were commissioned to work as session musicians on many of these recordings, many of which were written or co-written by Haley and members of the Comets. The Clymax experiment only lasted about a year. In 1959, Haley's relationship with Decca collapsed; after a final set of instrumental-only recordings in the fall, Haley announced he was leaving Decca for the new [[Warner Bros. Records]] label, which released two more albums in 1960, which were moderately successful. In 1960 Franny Beecher and Rudi Pompilli left the Comets to start their own record label. Replacing Beecher was a 20-year-old guitarist, [[Johnny Kay]], from Chester, Pennsylvania. Beecher later returned briefly to play with the Comets, when his record label failed to take off, sharing guitar duties with Kay. Kay left the band in 1966 but returned in the early 1970s for an aborted world tour. He appeared in the Wembley show, which was filmed and released as the London Rock and Roll Show.\n\n==Mexico and the late 1960s==\nIn 1961\u20131962, '''Bill Haley y sus Cometas''' (as the band was known in Hispanic America) signed with the [[Orfe\u00f3n]] label of Mexico and scored an unexpected hit with \"Twist Espa\u00f1ol\", a Spanish-language recording based on the [[Twist (dance)|twist]] dance craze, which was sweeping America at the time. Haley followed up with \"Florida Twist\" (#3 MEX, according to Billboard Hits Of The World 04.21.62), which was for a time the biggest-selling single in Mexican history. Although [[Chubby Checker]] and [[Hank Ballard]] were credited with starting the twist craze in America, in Mexico and Latin America, Bill Haley and His Comets were proclaimed the Kings of the Twist. Thanks to the success of \"Twist Espa\u00f1ol\" and \"Florida Twist\", among others, the band had continued success in Mexico and Latin America over the next few years, selling many recordings of Spanish and Spanish-flavored material and simulated live performances ([[overdubbed]] audience over studio recordings) on the Orfeon label and its subsidiary, Dimsa. They hosted a television series, ''Orfeon a Go-Go'', and made [[cameo appearance]]s in several movies, lip-synching some of their old hits. Haley, who was fluent in Spanish, recorded a number of songs in the language, but most of the band's output during these years was instrumental recordings, many utilizing local session musicians playing trumpet. There was also some experimentation with Haley's style during this time; one single for Orfeon was a folk ballad, \"Jimmy Martinez\", which Haley recorded without the Comets.\n\nIn 1966, the Comets (without Bill Haley) cut an album for Orfeon as session musicians for Big Joe Turner, who had always been an idol to Haley; no joint performance of \"Shake, Rattle and Roll\" was recorded, however. In a 1974 interview with [[BBC Radio]], Haley said Turner's career was in a slump at this time, so he used his then-considerable influence with Orfeon to get Turner a recording session. The Comets' association with Orfeon/Dimsa ended later that year.\n\nBy 1967, as related by Haley in an interview with radio host [[Red Robinson]] in that year, the group was \"a free agent\" without any recording contracts at all, although the band continued to perform regularly in North America and Europe. During this year, Haley\u2014without the Comets\u2014recorded a pair of demos in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]: a country-western song, \"[[Jealous Heart]]\", on which he was backed by a local [[mariachi]] band (similar in style to the earlier \"Jimmy Martinez\"), and a late-60s-style rocker, \"Rock on Baby\", backed by a group called Superfine Dandelion. Neither recording would be released for 30 years. In 1968, Haley and the Comets recorded a single for the [[United Artists]] label, a version of [[Tom T. Hall]]'s \"[[That's How I Got to Memphis]]\", but no long-term association with the label resulted. In order to revive his recording career, Haley turned to Europe.\n\n==Revival==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Bill Haley Little Richard Columbia 1956.jpg|left|thumb|Little Richard and Bill Haley on the set of the 1956 Columbia Pictures film ''Don't Knock the Rock''.]] -->\nBy the late 1960s, Haley and the Comets were considered an \"oldies\" act. The band's popularity never waned in Europe. The group signed a lucrative deal with [[Sonet Records]] of Sweden in 1968 and recorded in a new version of \"Rock Around the Clock\", which hit the European charts that year. The band recorded a mixture of live and studio albums for the label over the next decade.\n\nIn the United States in 1969, promoter Richard Nader launched a series of [[rock and roll revival]] concert tours featuring artists of the 1950s and 1960s. At one of the first of these shows, held at the [[Felt Forum]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, Haley received an eight-and-a-half-minute standing ovation following his performance, as Nader related in his recorded introduction to Haley's live album ''Bill Haley Scrapbook'', which was recorded a few weeks later at the [[The Bitter End|Bitter End]] club in New York.\n\nThe band appeared in several concert films in the early 1970s, including ''[[The London Rock and Roll Show]]'' (for which Haley's 1960\u201366 lead guitarist, John Kay, briefly rejoined the band) and ''[[Let the Good Times Roll (film)|Let the Good Times Roll]]''. After 1974, tax and management problems prevented Haley from performing in the United States, so he performed in Europe almost exclusively, though he also toured South America in 1975. The band was also kept busy in the studio, recording numerous albums for Sonet and other labels in the 1970s, several with a [[country music]] flavor. In 1974, Haley's original Decca recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" hit the American sales charts once again, thanks to its use in the film ''[[American Graffiti]]'' and for two years, on the television program ''[[Happy Days]]''.<ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\n==Late career==\nIn February 1976, Haley's saxophone player and best friend, [[Rudy Pompilli]], died of [[cancer]] after a nearly 20-year career with the Comets. Haley continued to tour for the next year with a succession of new sax players, but his popularity was waning again, and his 1976 performance in London was critically lambasted in the music media, such as ''[[Melody Maker]]''. That year, the group also recorded an album, ''R-O-C-K'' at [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] for Sonet Records. According to one source, \"he had conflicted feelings about fame, was extremely private, suffered chronic alcoholism, and troubled relationships\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aFzMvgEACAAJ|title=Crazy Man, Crazy The Bill Haley Story|author=Bill Haley, Jr., Peter Benjaminson |page= |date=October 3, 2019 |publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=9781617137112|accessdate=November 10, 2023}}</ref> Having admitted to an alcohol problem in a 1974 radio interview for the [[BBC]],<ref name=FallingComet>{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/falling-comet/|title=Falling Comet|date=2011-06-01|website=Texas Monthly|language=en|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&q=bill+haley+%22alcoholism%22&pg=PP15|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|last=Bronson|first=Fred|date=2003|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2|language=en}}</ref> Haley continued to battle alcoholism into the 1970s. \nIn early 1977, Haley announced his retirement from performing and settled down at his home in Mexico. According to the John Swenson biography of Haley, the musician was quoted as saying that he and Pompilli had an agreement that if one died, the other would retire.\n\nThe Comets continued to tour on their own during this period.\n\nIn 1979, Haley was persuaded to return to performing with the offer of a lucrative contract to tour Europe. An almost completely new group of musicians, mostly British, including saxophonist [[Pete Thomas (saxophonist)|Pete Thomas]], were assembled to perform as the Comets. Haley appeared on numerous television shows and in the movie ''Blue Suede Shoes'', filmed at one of his London concerts in March 1979. A few days later, a performance in [[Birmingham]] was videotaped and aired on UK television; it was released on DVD in 2005. During the March tour, Haley recorded several tracks in London for his next album for Sonet, completing the work that summer in Muscle Shoals; the album, ''Everyone Can Rock & Roll'', issued later in 1979, was the last release of new recordings by Haley before his death.\n\nOn November 26, 1979, Haley and the Comets performed for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.royalvarietycharity.org/royal-variety-performance/archive/detail/1979-london-theatre-royal|title=Performances :: 1979, London Theatre Royal &#124; Royal Variety Charity|website=Royalvarietycharity.org|access-date=May 12, 2023}}</ref> a moment Haley considered the proudest of his career. It was also the last time he performed in Europe and the last time most fans saw him perform \"Rock Around the Clock\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2023}}\n\nHaley made his final performances in South Africa in May and June 1980. Just before the South African tour commenced, Haley's health was reportedly failing, and he was reportedly diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]]; a planned tour of Germany in the autumn of 1980 was subsequently cancelled.  The tour was critically lambasted, but surviving recordings of a performance in [[Johannesburg]] show Haley in good spirits and good voice. Nonetheless, according to the Haley News fan club newsletter and the Haley biography ''Sound and Glory'', planned concerts (such as a fall 1980 tour of Germany) and proposed recording sessions in New York and [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] were cancelled, including a potential reunion with past members of the Comets.\n\nDespite his illness, Haley started compiling notes for possible use as a basis for either a biographical film based on his life, or a published autobiography (accounts differ), and there were plans for him to record an album in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when the brain tumor began affecting his behavior and he returned to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]]. \nThe October 25, 1980, issue of German tabloid ''[[Bild]]'' reported that Haley had a brain tumor. Haley's British manager, Patrick Malynn, was quoted as saying that \"Haley had taken a fit [and] didn't recognize anyone anymore.\" In addition, a doctor who examined Haley said that the tumor was inoperable.<ref name=\"Bill Haley 1982. page 154\">''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll''. John Swenson. 1982. Stein and Day. p. 154, {{ISBN|0-8128-2909-3}}</ref>  Haley's widow Martha, who was with him in these troubling times, denied he had a brain tumor, as did his close friend Hugh McCallum. Martha and friends related that Haley did not want to go on the road anymore and that ticket sales for that planned tour of Germany in the fall of 1980 were slow. McCallum said, \"It's my unproven gut feeling that that [the brain tumor] was said to curtail talks about the tour and play the sympathy card.\"<ref name=FallingComet/>\n\nHaley returned to his home in [[Harlingen, Texas]].  At this time, Haley's alcoholism appeared to be worsening. According to Martha, by this time, she and Haley fought all the time, and she told him to stop drinking or move out. Eventually, he moved into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes, he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. \"There were days we never saw him,\" said his daughter Martha Maria.<ref name=FallingComet/> In addition to Haley's drinking problems, it was becoming evident that he was also developing serious mental health issues. Martha Maria said, \"It was like sometimes he was drunk even when he wasn't drinking.\" After being picked up by the police in Harlingen several times for alleged intoxication, Martha had a judge put Haley in the hospital, where he was seen by a psychiatrist, who said Haley's brain was overproducing a chemical, like adrenaline. The doctor prescribed a medication to stop the overproduction, but said Haley would have to stop drinking. Martha said, \"This is pointless.\" She took him home, however, fed him and gave him his first dose. As soon as he felt better, he went back out to his room in the pool house, and the downward spiral continued until his death.<ref name=FallingComet/>\n\nMedia reports immediately following his death indicated that Haley displayed deranged and erratic behavior in the final weeks of his life. According to a biography of Haley by John Swenson, released in 1982,<ref name=\"Bill Haley 1982\">''Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll'', pp. 155-159, John Swenson. (1982. Pub.

The single reached Number 50 in the UK but was not released in the United States.\n\nIn 1987, Bill Haley was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. At that time, supporting bands were not also named to the Hall of Fame. This policy was subsequently changed, and in 2012 a special committee of the Hall of Fame inducted the Comets. Bill Haley and His Comets were also inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]].

The Comets placed their handprints in cement, leaving a space blank for Haley.\n\n==The Comets==\nMore than 100 musicians performed with Bill Haley & His Comets between 1952 and Haley's death in 1981, many becoming fan favorites along the way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |title=Bill Haley Extra Page 2 |publisher=Rockabillyhall.com |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011233205/http://rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |archive-date=October 11, 2011 }}</ref> Several short-lived Comets reunions were attempted in the 1970s and 1980s, including one contingent (organized by [[Baltimore]]-based piano player [[Joey Welz]], who played piano for the Comets from 1962 to 1965<ref name=\"The Bill Haley Who's Who\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |title=The Bill Haley Who's Who |publisher=Rockabilly Hall of Fame |access-date=March 26, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204054809/http://www.rockabillyhall.com/Extra2.html |archive-date=February 4, 2012 }}</ref>) that appeared on ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]'', and another run by an [[Elvis Presley]] impersonator, Joey Rand (this group later lost a legal action over the right to use the Comets name). Only one group was sent out to perform by Haley himself and his management and production company, consisting of musicians who had played with Haley throughout the 1960s and 1970s\u2014lead guitarist \"Nick Masters\" (Mathias Nicholas Nastos), bassist Ray Cawley, singer Ray \"Pudge\" Parsons, and drummer Buddy Dee\u2014and who had continued to perform as the Comets between gigs and during Haley's retirement. This group rerecorded \"Rock Around the Clock\" for the television series ''Happy Days''.<ref name=\"The Bill Haley Who's Who\"/>\n\n'''The Comets''', featuring musicians who performed with Haley in 1954\u20131955, reunited in 1987 and are still touring the world as of 2007, playing showrooms in the United States and Europe. They have also recorded a half-dozen albums for small labels in Europe and the United States. This version of the group has also been credited as '''Bill Haley's Original Comets''' and, in circumstances in which the use of the Comets name is in dispute, '''A Tribute to Bill Haley''' and '''The Original Band'''. The basic lineup of this group from 1987 to May 2006 was Marshall Lytle (bass), Joey Ambrose (sax), Johnny Grande (piano), Dick Richards (drums) and Franny Beecher (guitar). British singer Jacko Buddin augmented the group on vocals during most of their European tours, with Lytle taking over on vocals for US and Canadian tours beginning in 2000 and full-time in Europe in the mid-2000s. Since they connected with Klaus Kettner's Rock It Concerts (Germany) in 1991, they have played hundreds of shows all over Europe and have appeared on dozens of television shows. In March 2007 they opened the Bill-Haley-Museum in Munich, Germany.\n\nTwo additional groups claim the name '''Bill Haley's Comets''' and have extensively toured in the United States since forming in the 1980s: one originally led by Haley's 1965\u201368 drummer John \"Bam-Bam\" Lane, the other run by Al Rappa, who played bass for Haley off and on between late 1959 and early 1969. (The 1959 album \"Strictly Instrumental\" on Decca was Rappa's first recording session with Bill Haley & His Comets. Haley had used Rappa as a fill-in player on live gigs for several years prior to that.) Both these musicians claim [[trademark]] ownership of the name \"Bill Haley's Comets\"; this dates back to Lane and Rappa (during a period when they worked together as one band) winning a trademark infringement lawsuit against the aforementioned Joey Rand group in 1989. Both Rappa's and Lane's bands have, from time to time, recruited other former Comets for their lineups (for example, in 2005, Rappa joined forces with Joey Welz), but for the most part the bandleaders are the only regular members who have worked with Bill Haley directly. Lane died in 2007, but his group continues to perform, led by bandleader Lenny Longo, who has no direct connection with Bill Haley. Rappa incorporated numerous professional musicians from the southern Indiana area (Guitarist Warren Batts, Joe Esarey, Dave Matthews, Joe Denton, saxophonist John Urbina, bassist Jody Hamilton Miley (previous bassist with the George Jones Show), and others) to make a full band. Rappa performed his Upright Bass show before thousands in audiences all over the country. Members of Rappa's \"Comets\" went on to form the LocoMotion Showband and continued touring the United States without Rappa adding Galen Deig (Drums) and Jimmy Baze (Bass) before eventually disbanding. Esarey went on to graduate from Cedarville University and Luther Rice Theological Seminary. He has since pastored churches and produced his own saxophone instrumental albums. Several of the members are now active in a very popular Southern Indiana 50's / 60's band called The Duke Boys.\n\nIn March and July 2005, the members of the 1954\u201355 group, now billed as simply the Comets after decades of controversy over the use of the name, made several high-profile concert appearances in New York City and Los Angeles organized by [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] as part of celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of rock and roll, the release of ''Blackboard Jungle'', the 50th anniversary of \"Rock Around the Clock\" hitting Number 1, and the 80th birthday of Bill Haley.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-film-that-helped-launch-rock/ |title=The Film That Helped Launch Rock |work=CBS News |date=March 18, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604091217/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/18/sunday/main681742.shtml |archive-date=June 4, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Entertainment/5-06-29RocknRoll.htm |title=Rock 'N' Roll Turns 50 in July |publisher=Seniorjournal.com |date=June 29, 2005 |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014044137/http://seniorjournal.com/NEWS/Entertainment/5-06-29RocknRoll.htm |archive-date=October 14, 2011 }}</ref> During a concert at the [[Viper Room]] in [[West Hollywood]] on July 6, 2005, the Comets were joined on stage for one song by [[Gina Haley]], the youngest daughter of Bill Haley; at a similar appearance in March they were joined by Haley's eldest son, John W. Haley. The 1954\u201355 Comets were also joined on stage by Bill Haley Jr. during several appearances in 2005 at Bubba Mac's in Somers Point, New Jersey, and at a 2005 concert recognizing the tenure of Bill Haley and the Saddlemen at the Twin Bars in Gloucester City, New Jersey.\n\nIn 2006, the 1954\u201355 Comets spent much of the year in residence at Dick Clark's American Bandstand Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]]. Meanwhile, the John Lane edition of Bill Haley's Comets recorded an album in Tennessee in early 2006, which has yet to be released.\n\nOn June 2, 2006, Johnny Grande, keyboardist with the 1954\u201355 Comets and a founding member of the band, died after a short illness. The following month, 85-year-old guitarist [[Franny Beecher]] announced his retirement, though he was at one point announced as participating in an early 2007 tour of Germany. The three remaining original Comets (Lytle, Richards, and Ambrose) continued to perform in Branson with new musicians taking over the keyboard and lead guitar positions. During September 2006, [[PBS]] in the United States aired a series of programs videotaped in Branson during the spring of 2006; these shows include the last recorded performances of the complete Original Comets lineup, including Grande. Lytle died in 2013, Beecher in 2014.

They had two other sons, Cecil (1934\u201389) and James (1932\u20132010). The family soon moved to [[Beaumont, Texas]]. Richardson graduated from Beaumont High School in 1947 and played on the \"Royal Purple\" American football team as a defensive lineman, wearing number 85.<ref>''Big Bopper: From Head Waiter To Rock'N'Roll Hero''. T Knight \u2013 Goldmine, 1989</ref> Richardson later was a radio [[disc jockey]] while at [[Lamar University|Lamar College]],<ref name=b&m /> where he studied prelaw and was a member of the band and chorus.\n\n== Career ==\n=== Radio ===\nRichardson worked part-time at [[Beaumont, Texas]] radio station KTRM (now [[KZZB]]). He was hired by the station full-time in 1949 and quit college. Richardson married Adrianne Joy Fryou on April 18, 1952, and their daughter Debra Joy was born in December 1953, soon after Richardson was promoted to supervisor of announcers at KTRM. In March 1955, he was [[conscription in the United States|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]] and did his basic training at [[Fort Ord]], California. Richardson spent the rest of his two-year service as a radar instructor at [[Fort Bliss]] in [[El Paso, Texas]]. In March 1957, following his discharge as a corporal, Richardson returned to KTRM radio, where he held down the \"Dishwashers' Serenade\" shift from 11&nbsp;a.m. to 12:30&nbsp;p.m., Monday to Friday.\n\nOne of the station's sponsors wanted Richardson for a new time slot, and suggested an idea for a show. Richardson had seen college students doing a dance called The Bop, and he decided to call himself \"The Big Bopper\". His new radio show ran from 3:00 to 6:00&nbsp;p.m., and he soon became the station's program director. In May 1957, Richardson broke the record for continuous on-air broadcasting by eight minutes. He performed for a total of five days, two hours, and eight minutes from a remote setup in the lobby of the [[Jefferson Theatre]] in downtown Beaumont, playing 1,821 records<ref name=accuracy /> and taking showers during five-minute newscasts.<ref name=\"b&m\">[https://www.bopperandme.co.uk/petition.php] {{dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref> Richardson is credited for creating the first music video in 1958, and recorded an early example himself.<ref name=accuracy>{{cite web|url=https://www.accuracyproject.org/cbe-Richardson,J.P.TheBigBopper.html|title=J.P. \"The Big Bopper\" Richardson|website=Accuracyproject.org|accessdate=January 21, 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Singer and songwriter ===\n[[File:Big Bopper's Wedding - Little Red Riding Hood ad - Cash Box 1958.jpg|thumb|Advertisement featured in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine, 13 December 1958]] \nRichardson, who played guitar, began his musical career as a songwriter. [[George Jones]] later recorded Richardson's \"[[White Lightning (The Big Bopper song)|White Lightning]]\", which became Jones's first No. 1 country hit in 1959 (#73 on the pop charts). Richardson also wrote \"[[Running Bear]]\" for [[Johnny Preston]], his friend from [[Port Arthur, Texas]]. The inspiration for the song came from Richardson's childhood memory of the [[Sabine River (Texas-Louisiana)|Sabine River]], where he heard stories about [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes. Preston's recording was not released until August 1959, six months after Richardson's death. The song became a No. 1 hit for three weeks in January 1960. The man who launched Richardson as a recording artist was [[Pappy Daily|Harold \"Pappy\" Daily]] from [[Houston]]. Daily was promotion director for [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] and [[Starday Records]] and signed Richardson to Mercury. Richardson's first single, \"Beggar to a King\", had a country flavor, but failed to gain any chart action.\n\nRichardson soon cut \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" as \"The Big Bopper\"<ref name=pc14>{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19763/m1/ |title= Show 14 \u2013 Big Rock Candy Mountain: Rock 'n' roll in the late fifties |show=14}}</ref> for Pappy Daily's [[D (record label)|D label]].

In November 1958, he scored a second hit, a raucous novelty tune entitled \"The Big Bopper's Wedding\", in which Richardson pretends to be getting [[cold feet]] at the altar.

His son, Jay Perry Richardson, was born two months after his death, in April 1959. Richardson had been building a recording studio in his home in [[Beaumont, Texas]], and was planning to invest in a radio station. Richardson had written 20 new songs that he planned to record himself or with other artists. His son also followed a musical career and was known professionally as \"The Big Bopper, Jr.\", performing around the world. He toured on the \"Winter Dance Party\" tour with Buddy Holly impersonator John Mueller on some of the same stages where his father had performed.{{citation needed|date=April 2022}}\n\nIn January 2007, Jay Richardson requested that his father's body be exhumed and an autopsy be performed in response to an internet rumor about guns being fired aboard the aircraft and Richardson initially surviving the crash.<ref>{{cite news|title=Autopsy of 'Big Bopper' to Address Rumors About 1959 Plane Crash|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/17/AR2007011701976.html|website=Washingtonpost.com|date=January 18, 2007}}</ref> The autopsy was performed by [[William M.

On the 11th night of the tour (February 2, 1959), they played at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]]. That night, Holly chartered an airplane from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]], intending to fly himself and his bandmates [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Tommy Allsup]] to their next tour venue in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. The musicians had been traveling by bus for over a week, and it had already broken down twice. They were tired, they had not been paid yet, and all of their clothes were dirty. The chartered flight would allow them to avoid another arduous bus ride, arrive early before the Moorhead show, do their laundry, and get some rest. Local pilot [[Roger Peterson (pilot)|Roger Peterson]] of Dwyer Flying Service (age 21) had agreed to take them. The weather forecast for the Clear Lake area was {{convert|18|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} that night with moderate gusty winds and light scattered snow, and Peterson was fatigued from a 17-hour workday, but he agreed to fly the trip.\n\n[[Frankie Sardo]] went to meet the crowd while Holly went into one of the dressing rooms at the Surf Ballroom where he notified Allsup and Jennings that he had chartered a plane to take them to [[Fargo, North Dakota]] (which is directly adjacent to Moorhead, Minnesota). On a friendly wager, Valens flipped a coin with Allsup for his seat on the plane\u2014and won. Meanwhile, J.P. Richardson was suffering from the flu and was complaining that the bus was too cold and uncomfortable for him, so Jennings voluntarily surrendered his seat. Upon hearing that his bandmates had given away their plane seats, Holly joked, \"Well, I hope your ol' bus freezes up again.\" Jennings jokingly replied, \"Well, I hope your ol' plane crashes.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-how-waylon-jennings-survived-the-day-the-music-died-122992/ |title=Flashback: How Waylon Jennings Survived Buddy Holly Crash |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=February 3, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe Clear Lake show ended at around midnight and Holly, Valens, and Richardson drove to the Mason City Airport, loaded their luggage and boarded the red and white single-engine [[Beechcraft Bonanza]]. Peterson received clearance from the control tower around 12:55&nbsp;a.m. on February 3, 1959, and they took off\u2014but the plane remained airborne for only a few minutes. It crashed at full throttle shortly after takeoff about 5 miles outside Mason City in the middle of farm country. The reason remains unknown but Peterson may have lost his visual reference and thought that he was ascending while he was actually descending.

Richardson's pioneering contribution to the genre has been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. The Big Bopper is fondly remembered not only for his distinctive singing and songwriting, but also as a humorist who combined the best elements of country, R&B, and rock 'n' roll.\n\nIn 2010, Richardson was inducted into the [[Iowa Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iowarocknroll.com/big-bopper |title=Big Bopper &#124; iowarocknroll |access-date=November 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627120647/https://www.iowarocknroll.com/big-bopper |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nRichardson's name is mentioned as one of the upcoming musical acts in both the print and television versions of [[Stephen King]]'s short story \"[[You Know They Got a Hell of a Band]]\" about a town inhabited by late musical legends.

She performed on television in the UK in 1959, before she had achieved much pop recognition in the United States. Her first hit single in the UK was \"[[Sweet Nothin's]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;4 on the UK singles chart in the spring of 1960. She subsequently had a UK hit (in 1961) with \"[[Let's Jump the Broomstick]]\", a rockabilly number recorded in 1959, which had not charted in the United States, but reached No.&nbsp;12 in the UK.<ref name=Bernstein />\n\nLee had two Top Ten hits in the UK that were not released as singles in her native country: the first, \"[[Speak to Me Pretty]]\" peaked at No.&nbsp;3 in May 1962 and was her greatest hit in the UK by chart placing, swiftly followed by \"[[Here Comes That Feeling]]\", which reached No.&nbsp;5 in the summer of 1962. The latter was issued as the B-side to \"[[Everybody Loves Me But You]]\" in the United States (which peaked at No.&nbsp;6 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100); however, \"Here Comes That Feeling\" also made an appearance in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, peaking at No.&nbsp;89, despite its B-side status in the US.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}\n\nIn 1962, while touring [[West Germany]], Lee appeared at the [[Star-Club]], [[Hamburg]], with the Beatles as the opening act.<ref name=Bernstein /> Lee also had big hits in the UK with \"[[All Alone Am I]]\" (No.&nbsp;7 in 1963) and \"[[As Usual]]\" (No.&nbsp;5 in 1964).{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}\n\nLee first visited England for three days in April 1959 as a last-minute replacement on ''[[Oh Boy!

The follow-up, the [[Mark James (songwriter)|Mark James]] composition \"[[Sunday Sunrise (song)|Sunday Sunrise]]\", reached No.&nbsp;6 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]''{{'s}} Hot Country Singles chart that October.

Two follow-ups also reached the Top 10 in 1980: \"[[The Cowgirl and the Dandy]]\" and \"[[Broken Trust]]\" (the latter featuring vocal backing by [[the Oak Ridge Boys]]). A 1982 album, ''[[The Winning Hand]]'', featuring Lee along with [[Dolly Parton]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Willie Nelson]], was a surprise hit, reaching the top ten on the U.S. country albums chart. Her last well-known hit was 1984's \"[[Hallelujah, I Love Her So]]\" in duet with [[George Jones]] (Lee sang this song individually before and released it in 1960 on ''[[This Is...Brenda]]'').

He was born to a musical family in [[Lubbock, Texas]], during the [[Great Depression]], and learned to play guitar and sing alongside his siblings. Holly's style was country and western music which he performed in Lubbock with his friends from high school.\n\nHolly made his first appearance on local television in 1952, and the following year he formed the group Buddy and Bob with his friend [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]]. In 1955, after opening for [[Elvis Presley]] as part of the Louisiana Hayride's habit of seeking out local bands to add to the show, Holly decided to pursue a career in music. Subsequently, he played with Presley three times that year and his band's style shifted from country and western to entirely rock and roll. In October that year, when Holly opened for [[Bill Haley & His Comets]], he was spotted by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall, who helped him get a contract with [[Decca Records]].\n\nHolly's recording sessions at Decca were produced by [[Owen Bradley]], who had become famous for producing orchestrated country hits for stars like [[Patsy Cline]]. Unhappy with Bradley's musical style and control in the studio, Holly went to producer [[Norman Petty]] in [[Clovis, New Mexico]], and recorded a demo of \"[[That'll Be the Day]]\", among other songs. Petty became the band's manager and sent the demo to [[Brunswick Records]], which released it as a single credited to [[The Crickets]], a name chosen by the band to subvert Decca's contract limitations. It became the name of Holly's band. In September 1957, as the band toured, \"That'll Be the Day\" topped the [[List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957|US]] and [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] singles charts. Its success was followed in October by another major hit, \"[[Peggy Sue]]\".\n\nThe album ''[[The \"Chirping\" Crickets]]'', released in November 1957, reached number five on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. Holly made his second appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in January 1958 and soon after toured Australia and then the UK. In early 1959, he assembled a new band, consisting of future country music star [[Waylon Jennings]] (bass), famed session musician [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums), and embarked on a tour of the mid-western US. After a show in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered an airplane to travel to his next show in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]]. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Holly, [[Ritchie Valens]], [[The Big Bopper]], and pilot Roger Peterson in a tragedy later referred to by [[Don McLean]] as \"[[The Day the Music Died]]\" in his song \"[[American Pie (song)|American Pie]]\".\n\nDuring his short career, Holly wrote and recorded many songs. He is often regarded as the artist who defined the traditional rock-and-roll lineup of two guitars, bass, and drums.  This was unfounded considering he first saw Elvis with this line-up in Lubbock in 1955 when Holly was strictly a country music band. Holly was a major influence on later popular music artists, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[the Beatles]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Brian May]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[the Hollies]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[Dave Edmunds]], [[Fiona Apple]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Marshall Crenshaw]], [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Elton John]]. Holly was among the first artists inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in 1986. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him number 13 in its list of 100 Greatest Artists in 2010. Holly was inducted into the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |last=swieser@panolawatchman.com |first=Stella Wieser |date=2022-08-10 |title=Texas Country Music Hall of Fame announces 2022 inductees |url=https://www.panolawatchman.com/news/texas-country-music-hall-of-fame-announces-2022-inductees/article_359dcf74-16de-11ed-9286-4396dc593295.html |access-date=2024-09-26 |website=Panola Watchman |language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life and career (1936\u20131955)===\nCharles Hardin Holley (spelled \"-ey\") was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], on September 7, 1936, the youngest of four children of Lawrence Odell \"L.O.\" Holley (1901\u20131985) and Ella Pauline Drake (1902\u20131990).

Buddy Holly was baptized a Baptist, and the family were members of the Tabernacle Baptist Church.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=12}}\n\nThe Holleys had an interest in music; all the family members except L.O. were able to play an instrument or sing. The elder Holley brothers performed in local talent shows; on one occasion, Buddy joined them on violin. Since he could not play it, his brother Larry greased the bow so it would not make any sound. The brothers won the contest.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=13}} During World War II, Larry and Travis were called to military service. Upon his return, Larry brought with him a guitar he had bought from a shipmate while serving in the Pacific. At age 11, at his mother's urging, Buddy took piano lessons but abandoned them after nine months. He switched to the guitar after he saw a classmate playing and singing on the school bus. Buddy's parents initially bought him a [[steel guitar]], but he insisted that he wanted a guitar like his brother's. His parents bought him an acoustic guitar from a local pawnshop, and he learned how to play it from Travis.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=14}}\n\nDuring his early childhood, Holly was influenced by the music of [[Hank Williams]], [[Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Moon Mullican]], [[Bill Monroe]], [[Hank Snow]], [[Bob Wills]], and the [[Carter Family]]. At Roscoe Wilson Elementary, Holly became friends with [[Bob Montgomery (songwriter)|Bob Montgomery]], and the two played together, practicing with songs by [[The Louvin Brothers]] and [[Johnnie & Jack]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=34}} They both listened to the radio programs ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on [[WSM (AM)|WSM]], ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' on [[KWKH]], and ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. At the same time, Holly played with other musicians he met in high school, including [[Sonny Curtis]] and [[Jerry Allison]].{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|p=80|2007}} In 1952 Holly and Jack Neal participated as a duo billed as Buddy and Jack in a talent contest on a local television show. After Neal left, he was replaced by Bob Montgomery, and they were billed as Buddy and Bob. They soon started performing on the ''Sunday Party'' show on [[KDAV]] in 1953 and performed live gigs in Lubbock.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=6|2003}} At that time, Holly was influenced by late-night radio stations that played blues and rhythm and blues (R&B). He would sit in his car with Curtis and tune to distant radio stations that could only be received at night, when local transmissions ceased.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=7|2003}} Holly then modified his music by blending his earlier [[country and western]] influence with R&B.{{sfn|Wishart|p=540|2004}} We do know it wasn't until Holly saw Elvis in Lubbock that led him to follow the Presley example.\n\nBy 1955, after graduating from [[Lubbock High School]], Holly decided to pursue a full-time career in music. He was further encouraged after seeing Elvis Presley perform live in Lubbock, whose act was booked by Pappy Dave Stone of KDAV. In February, Holly opened for Presley at the Fair Park Coliseum, in April at the Cotton Club, and again in June at the Coliseum. By that time, Holly had incorporated into his band Larry Welborn on the stand-up bass and Allison on drums, as his style shifted from country and western to [[rock and roll]] due to seeing Presley's performances and hearing his music.{{sfn|Lehmer|p=7|2003}} In October, Stone booked Bill Haley & His Comets and placed Holley as the opening act to be seen by [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] scout Eddie Crandall. Impressed, Crandall persuaded [[Grand Ole Opry]] manager Jim Denny to seek a recording contract for Holley. Stone sent a demo tape, which Denny forwarded to [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]], who signed the band to [[Decca Records]] in February 1956.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|p=130|1997}} In the contract, Decca misspelled Holly's surname as \"Holly\", and from then on he was known as Buddy Holly, instead of his real name Holley.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}}\n\nOn January 26, 1956, Holly attended his first formal recording session, which was produced by [[Owen Bradley]].{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=97}} He attended two more sessions in Nashville, but with the producer selecting the session musicians and arrangements, Holly became increasingly frustrated by his lack of creative control.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} In April 1956, Decca released \"[[Blue Days, Black Nights]]\" as a single, with \"Love Me\" on the B-side. Denny included Holly on a tour as the opening act for [[Faron Young]]. During the tour, they were promoted as Buddy Holly and the Two Tones, while later Decca called them Buddy Holly and the Three Tunes.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=130}} The label later released Holly's second single \"Modern Don Juan\", [[b-side|backed with]] \"You Are My One Desire\". Neither single made an impression. On January 22, 1957, Decca informed Holly his contract would not be renewed, but insisted he could not record the same songs for anyone else for five years.{{sfn|Uslan|Solomon|1981|p=49}}\n\n===The Crickets (1956\u20131957) ===\n{{Main article|The Crickets}}\n[[File:Buddy Holly & The Crickets publicity portrait - cropped.jpg|Buddy Holly and the Crickets in 1957 (top to bottom: Allison, Holly and Mauldin)|thumb]]\nHolly was unhappy with the results of his time with Decca, and inspired by the success of [[Buddy Knox]]'s \"[[Party Doll]]\" and [[Jimmy Bowen]]'s \"[[I'm Stickin' with You]]\", he visited [[Norman Petty]], who had produced and promoted both records. Together with Allison, bassist [[Joe B. Mauldin]], and rhythm guitarist [[Niki Sullivan]], he went to Petty's studio in [[Clovis, New Mexico]]. The group recorded a demo of \"[[That'll Be the Day]]\", a song they had previously recorded in Nashville. In June 1956, Holly along with his older brother Larry as well as Allison and [[Sonny Curtis]] had gone to see the film ''[[The Searchers]]'', starring [[John Wayne]], in which Wayne repeatedly used the phrase \"That'll be the day\". This line of dialogue inspired the young musicians.<ref>Trzcinski, Matthew (February 10, 2022).

Petty became his manager and sent the record to [[Brunswick Records]] in New York City. Holly, still under contract with Decca, could not release the record under his name, so a band name was used; Allison proposed the name \"Crickets.\" Brunswick gave Holly a basic agreement to release \"That'll Be the Day\", leaving him with both artistic control and financial responsibility for future recordings.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Amburn |first=Ellis |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3EAGAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT101 |title=Buddy Holly: A Biography |date=April 22, 2014 |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |isbn=9781466868564 |page=101 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>\n\nImpressed with the demo, the label's executives released it without recording a new version. \"I'm Looking for Someone to Love\" was the B-side; the single was credited to [[The Crickets]]. Petty and Holly later learned that Brunswick was a subsidiary of Decca, which legally cleared future recordings under the name Buddy Holly. Recordings credited to the Crickets would be released on Brunswick, while the recordings under Holly's name were released on another subsidiary label, [[Coral Records]]. Holly concurrently held a recording contract with both labels.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=131}}\n\nNorman Petty reasoned correctly that disc jockeys would be reluctant to play and promote multiple new records by the same artist, but would have no problem playing these same records if they were credited to different performers. Holly himself was unaware of this strategy; in a 1957 radio interview with Dale Lowery, Holly said, \"We have three records going out right now. Of course, the first one was 'That'll Be the Day', the first one released. Then we have a new one out by The Crickets, called 'Oh Boy!' and 'Not Fade Away', and then there's one out, it's the same group but it's under my name -- I don't know why they did it that way, but it went out under my name -- called 'Peggy Sue' and 'Everyday'.\"<ref>Buddy Holly interviewed by Dale Lowery for KTOP radio (Topeka, Kansas), 1957.</ref> Holly's records were released with labels reading \"Buddy Holly\" ''or'' \"The Crickets\"; the band was never credited on records as \"Buddy Holly ''and'' the Crickets\" until 1962, when a compilation album was released.\n\n\"That'll Be the Day\" was released on July 27, 1957. Petty booked Holly and the Crickets for a tour with [[Irvin Feld]], who had noticed the band after \"That'll Be the Day\" appeared on the R&B chart. He booked them for appearances in Washington, D.C., Baltimore, and New York City.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=16}} The band was booked to play at New York's [[Apollo Theater]] on August 16\u201322. During the opening performances, the group did not impress the audience, but they were accepted after they included \"[[Bo Diddley (Bo Diddley song)|Bo Diddley]].\" By the end of their run at the Apollo, \"That'll Be the Day\" was climbing the charts. Encouraged by the single's success, Petty started to prepare two album releases; a solo album for Holly and another for the Crickets.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=17}} Holly appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', hosted by [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], on August 26. Before leaving New York, the band befriended [[The Everly Brothers]].{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=18}}\n[[File:That'll Be the Day ad - Cash Box 1957.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' advertisement, August 3, 1957]] \n\"That'll Be the Day\" topped the [[Number-one hits of 1957 (United States)|US \"Best Sellers in Stores\"]] chart on September 23 and was number one on the UK Singles Chart for three weeks in November.{{sfn|Lehmer|2003|p=19}} Three days prior, Coral released \"[[Peggy Sue]]\", backed with \"[[Everyday (Buddy Holly song)|Everyday]]\", with Holly credited as the performer. By October, \"Peggy Sue\" had reached number three on ''Billboard''{{'}}s pop chart and number two on the R&B chart; it peaked at number six on the UK Singles chart. As the success of the song grew, it brought more attention to Holly, with the band at the time being billed as \"Buddy Holly and the Crickets\"{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=57}} (although never on records during Holly's lifetime).\n\nIn the last week of September, the band members flew to Lubbock to visit their families.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=58}} Holly's high school girlfriend, Echo McGuire, had left him for a fellow student.{{sfn|Norman|p=156|1996}} Aside from McGuire, Holly had a relationship with Lubbock fan June Clark.{{sfn|Norman|p=127|1996}} After Clark ended their relationship, Holly realized the importance of his relationship with McGuire and considered his relationship with Clark a temporary one.{{sfn|Norman|p=156|1996}} Meanwhile, for their return to recording, Petty arranged a session in [[Oklahoma City]], where he was performing with his own band. While the band drove to the location, the producer set up a makeshift studio. The rest of the songs needed for an album and singles were recorded; Petty later dubbed the material in Clovis.{{sfn|Gribbin|2012|p=58}} The resulting album, ''[[The \"Chirping\" Crickets]]'', was released on November 27, 1957. It reached number five on the UK Albums Chart. In October, Brunswick released the second single by the Crickets, \"[[Oh, Boy! (The Crickets song)|Oh, Boy!]]\", with \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\" on the B-side.

Upon their return to the United States, Holly and the Crickets joined Alan Freed's ''Big Beat Show'' tour for 41 dates.

The session produced the recordings of \"[[It's So Easy! (The Crickets song)|It's So Easy]]\" and \"[[Heartbeat (Buddy Holly song)|Heartbeat]].\" Holly was impressed by Allsup and invited him to join the Crickets. In June, Holly traveled alone to New York for a solo recording session. Without the Crickets, he chose to be backed by a jazz and R&B band, recording \"Now We're One\" and [[Bobby Darin]]'s \"[[Early in the Morning (Bobby Darin song)|Early in the Morning]].\"{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2007|p=91}}\n\nDuring a visit to the offices of [[Peermusic|Peer-Southern]], Holly met [[Mar\u00eda Elena Santiago]]. He asked her out on their first meeting and proposed marriage to her on their first date. The wedding took place on August 15. Norman Petty had tried to dissuade Holly from marriage; he felt that it would disappoint Holly's public and damage his career.\n\nHolly and Santiago frequented many of New York's music venues, including the [[Village Gate]], Blue Note, [[Village Vanguard]], and Johnny Johnson's. Santiago later said that Holly was keen to learn fingerstyle flamenco guitar and that he would often visit her aunt's home to play the piano there. Holly planned collaborations between soul singers and rock and roll. He wanted to make an album with [[Ray Charles]] and [[Mahalia Jackson]]. Holly also had ambitions to work in film and registered for acting classes with Lee Strasberg's [[Actors Studio]].{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=281}}\n\nSantiago accompanied Holly on tours. To hide her marriage to Holly, she was presented as the Crickets' secretary. She took care of the laundry and equipment set-up and collected the concert revenues. Santiago kept the money for the band instead of its habitual transfer to Petty in New Mexico.{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=274}} She and her aunt Provi Garcia, an executive in the Latin American music department at Peer-Southern, convinced Holly that Petty was paying the band's royalties from Coral-Brunswick into his own company's account. Holly planned to retrieve his royalties from Petty and to later fire him as manager and producer. At the recommendation of the Everly Brothers, Holly hired lawyer Harold Orenstein to negotiate his royalties.{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=280}} The problems with Petty were triggered after he was unable to pay Holly. At the time, New York promoter Manny Greenfield reclaimed a large part of Holly's earnings; Greenfield had booked Holly for shows during previous tours. The two had a verbal agreement; Greenfield would obtain 5% of the booking earnings. Greenfield later felt he was also acting as Holly's manager and deserved a higher payment, which Holly refused. Greenfield then sued Holly. Under New York law, because Holly's royalties originated in New York and were directed out of the state, the payments were frozen until the dispute was settled.{{sfn|Laing|p=153|2010}}\n\nIn September, Holly returned to Clovis for a new recording session, which yielded \"Reminiscing\" and \"Come Back Baby.\" During the session, he ventured into producing by recording Lubbock DJ [[Waylon Jennings]]. Holly produced the single \"Jole Blon\" and \"When Sin Stops (Love Begins)\" for Jennings.{{sfn|Carr, Joseph|Munde, Alan|1997|p=155}} Holly became increasingly interested in the New York music, recording, and publishing scene. Holly and Santiago settled in Apartment 4H of the Brevoort Apartments, at 11 Fifth Avenue in [[Greenwich Village]], where he recorded a series of acoustic songs, including \"[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]]\" and \"What to Do.\"{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=274\u2013278}} The inspiration to record the songs is sometimes attributed to the ending of his relationship with McGuire.{{sfn|Lloyd Webber|2015}}\n\nOn October 21, 1958, Holly's final studio session was recorded at the [[Pythian Temple (New York City)|Pythian Temple]] on West 70th Street (now a luxury condominium). Known by Holly fans as \"the string sessions\", Holly recorded four songs for Coral in an innovative collaboration with an 18-piece ensemble composed of former members of the [[NBC Symphony Orchestra]] (including saxophonist [[Boomie Richman]]) under the direction of [[Dick Jacobs]].\n\nThe four songs recorded during the {{frac|3|1|2}}-hour session were: \n*\"True Love Ways\" (written by Buddy Holly), \n*\"[[Moondreams (Norman Petty song)|Moondreams]]\" (written by [[Norman Petty]]), \n*\"[[Raining in My Heart]]\" (written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant) and \n*\"[[It Doesn't Matter Anymore]]\" (written by Paul Anka).{{sfn|Norman|2011|p=276\u2013278}}\nThese four songs were the only ones Coral ever mixed in stereo, but only \"Raining in My Heart\" was released that way (in 1959, on an obscure promotional LP titled ''Hitsville''). All four records otherwise received releases in mono. The original stereo mixes were consulted many years later for compilation albums.\n\nHolly ended his association with Petty in December 1958. His band members kept Petty as their manager and split from Holly. The split was amicable and based on logistics: Holly had decided to settle permanently in New York, where the business and publishing offices were, and the Crickets preferred not to leave their home state.\n\n===Winter Dance Party tour and death (1959)===\n{{Main|The Day the Music Died}}\n[[File:GlassesSign.jpg|thumb|right|Signpost near the Clear Lake crash site]]\n\nHolly vacationed with his wife in Lubbock and visited Jennings's radio station in December 1958.{{sfn|Jennings|Kaye|1996|p = 51}} For the start of the [[Winter Dance Party]] tour, he assembled a band consisting of [[Waylon Jennings]] (electric bass), [[Tommy Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Carl Bunch]] (drums).{{sfn|Corbin, Sky|2014}} Holly and Jennings left for New York City, arriving on January 15, 1959.

The amount of travel involved created logistical problems, as the distance between venues had not been considered when scheduling performances. Adding to the problem, the unheated tour buses twice broke down in freezing weather, with dire consequences. Holly's drummer, Carl Bunch, was hospitalized for [[frostbite]] to his toes (sustained while aboard the bus), so Holly decided to seek other transportation.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=H4TSH_b7IHYC&pg=PA13 13]}} On February 2, before their appearance in [[Clear Lake, Iowa]], Holly chartered a four-seat [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] airplane for Jennings, Allsup, and himself, from Dwyer Flying Service in [[Mason City, Iowa]]. Holly's idea was to depart following the show at the [[Surf Ballroom]] in Clear Lake and fly to their next venue, in [[Moorhead, Minnesota]], via [[Fargo, North Dakota]], allowing them time to rest and launder their clothes and avoid an arduous bus journey. Immediately after the Clear Lake show (which ended just before midnight), Allsup agreed to flip a coin for the seat with [[Ritchie Valens]]. Valens called heads; when he won, he reportedly said, \"That's the first time I've ever won anything in my life.\" Allsup later opened a restaurant/bar in [[Fort Worth, Texas]], called Heads Up Saloon.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Galloway |first=Paul |date=June 24, 1988 |title=Hit parade |work=Chicago Tribune |id={{ProQuest|882608515}}}}</ref> Waylon Jennings voluntarily gave up his seat to [[The Big Bopper|J.

However, an autopsy done at the request of Richardson's son in 2007 found no evidence to support the rumors.

The following day, she suffered a miscarriage. Holly's mother, who heard the news on the radio in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed. Because of Elena's miscarriage, in the months following the accident, some government authorities implemented a policy against announcing victims' names until after families are informed.{{sfn|Suddath|2009}} Santiago did not attend the funeral and has never visited the gravesite.

The finished tracks became the first posthumous Holly single, \"[[Peggy Sue Got Married (song)|Peggy Sue Got Married]]\"/\"[[Crying, Waiting, Hoping]].\" The new release was successful enough to warrant an album drawing upon the other Holly demos, using the same studio personnel, in January 1960.<ref>Goldrosen, John (1979).

During the January 1969 recording sessions for their album ''[[Let It Be (album)|Let It Be]]'', the Beatles played a slow, impromptu version of \"Mailman, Bring Me No More Blues\" \u2013 which Holly popularized but did not write \u2013 with Lennon mimicking Holly's vocal style.{{sfn|Margotin|Guesdon|2014|p=186}} Lennon recorded a cover version of \"Peggy Sue\" on his 1975 album ''[[Rock 'n' Roll (John Lennon album)|Rock 'n' Roll]]''.{{sfn|Blaney, John|p=163|2005}} McCartney owns the [[Music publisher|publishing rights]] to Holly's song catalog.{{sfn|BBC News staff|2003}}\n\n==== Bob Dylan ====\nOn January 31, 1959, two nights before Holly's death, 17-year-old [[Bob Dylan]] attended Holly's performance in [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]]. Dylan referred to this in his acceptance speech when he received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] for ''[[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|Time Out of Mind]]'' in 1998: \"...&nbsp;when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at [[Duluth National Guard Armory]] and I was three feet away from him&nbsp;... and he looked at me.

The Rolling Stones had a hit version of the song in 1964.{{sfn|Norman|p=12|2011}} Richards later said, \"[Holly] passed it on via the Beatles and via [the Rolling Stones]&nbsp;...&nbsp;He's in everybody.\"{{sfn|Amburn, Ellis|2014|p=274}}\n\n==== Steve Marriott ====\nFrom a young age, [[Steve Marriott]] was a huge fan of Holly and would mimic his hero by wearing large-rimmed spectacles with the lenses removed. Marriott wrote his first song, called \"Shelia My Dear\", after his aunt Shelia to whom he was close. Those who heard the song said it was played at a jaunty pace in the style of Holly and his bandmates also nicknamed him 'Buddy'.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hewitt |first1=Paolo |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4fwswEACAAJ |title=Steve Marriott: All Too Beautiful |last2=Hellier |first2=John |date=2004 |publisher=Helter Skelter Publishing |isbn=978-1-900924-44-3 |pages=44 |language=en}}</ref> Marriott also recorded a version of [[Kenny Lynch]]'s song \"Give Her My Regards\" b/w \"Imaginary Love\", the B-side written by Marriott, and released as a [[Single (music)|45-rpm]] in 1963 on Decca, inspired by Buddy Holly and the Crickets.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/master/907139-Steve-Marriott-Give-Her-My-Regards \"Steve Marriott - Give Her My Regards\"].

The song's lyric, which calls the incident \"The Day the Music Died\", became popularly associated with the crash. McLean's album ''[[American Pie (Don McLean album)|American Pie]]'' is dedicated to Holly.{{sfn|Crouse, Richard|p=86|2012}} In 2015, McLean wrote, \"Buddy Holly would have the same stature musically whether he would have lived or died, because of his accomplishments&nbsp;...&nbsp;By the time he was 22 years old, he had recorded some 50 tracks, most of which he had written himself&nbsp;...&nbsp;in my view and the view of many others, a hit&nbsp;...&nbsp;Buddy Holly and the Crickets were the template for all the rock bands that followed.\"{{sfn|McLean|2015}}\n\n==== Eric Clapton ====\n''The Chirping Crickets'' was the first album [[Eric Clapton]] ever bought; he later saw Holly on ''Sunday Night at the London Palladium''. In his autobiography, Clapton recounted the first time he saw Holly and his Fender, saying, \"I thought I'd died and gone to heaven&nbsp;...&nbsp;it was like seeing an instrument from outer space and I said to myself: 'That's the future \u2013 that's what I want{{'\"}}.{{sfn|Clapton, Eric|p=19|2010}} In 1969, his supergroup [[Blind Faith]] released a cover version of Holly's \"Well All Right\" featuring [[Steve Winwood]] on vocals.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gallucci |first=Michael |date=January 11, 2023 |title=Top 10 Jeff Beck Songs |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jeff-beck-songs/ |access-date=May 22, 2024 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |language=en}}</ref>\n\n====Bobby Vee====\nThe launch of [[Bobby Vee]]'s successful musical career resulted from Holly's death; Vee was selected to replace Holly on the tour that continued after the plane crash.

Originally from New Jersey, he formed Red Wanting Blue in the fall of 1995. In 1996 Red Wanting Blue released their first full-length album titled ''Velveteen''.  While still in college in 1998, the band went on to release their second full-length album ''The Image Trigger''.\n\n===''Model Citizen'' (2000\u20132001)===\n''Model Citizen'' was RWB's third studio release and arguably their breakthrough album. It was the first album with current bassist, Mark McCullough. After the release of ''Model Citizen'', Red Wanting Blue started gaining media attention for their rapidly growing grassroots following. The original version of the song ''Audition'' was recorded for this album. The song was picked up nationally by [[Abercrombie and Fitch]] and placed on rotation at their stores throughout the US. ''Audition'' was later re-vamped and re-recorded for the 2011 album ''From the Vanishing Point'' and found success on the radio and television in 2012 and 2013.\n\n===''Sirens'' (2001\u20132002)===\n''Sirens'' is Red Wanting Blue's fourth studio release. The band would eventually dedicate ''Sirens'' to those lives lost during the [[September 11 attacks]]. Red Wanting Blue toured to support ''Sirens'' by headlining small rock clubs across the US.\n\n===''Souvenirs of City Life'' (2002\u20132003)===\n''Souvenirs of City Life'' is the band's fifth studio release. ''Souvenirs of City Life'' debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on [[Aware Records]] online store \u2013 awarestore.com. Red Wanting Blue toured extensively during this time period headlining rock clubs and also touring alongside longtime friends [[O.A.R.

Honored, the band thanked those fans in the liner notes of this album. RWB picked up an additional member, guitarist, keyboardist and back-up vocalist Greg Rahm. RWB independently set out on a large tour (headlining venues from mid-level clubs to small theaters) stretching from New York to California. Songs from this album found themselves on [[XM Satellite Radio]]. During this time RWB was featured as an unsigned band to watch on Demodiaries.com, Kings of A&R and Hits Magazine. \n\n===''The Warehouse Sessions'' (2006\u20132008)===\n''The Warehouse Sessions'' is a live album/DVD recorded in the band's warehouse and studio space in front of 100 of RWB biggest fans from across the country. Tickets to this intimate event sold out in under two minutes. ''The Warehouse Sessions'' debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on Awarestore.com ([[Aware Records]] online store) in its first week of pre-sale. It was made to bridge the gap between ''Pride: The Cold Lover'' and 2008's ''These Magnificent Miles''. This album/DVD featured early acoustic versions of fan favorites \"You Are My Las Vegas\" and \"Finger in the Air\" from ''These Magnificent Miles''.\n\n===''These Magnificent Miles'' (2008\u20132010)===\n[[File:Centennial Concert (4268332410).jpg|thumb|Performing at [[Anderson Arena]] in 2010.]]\nThe band enlisted Grammy nominated producer Jamie Candiloro ([[Ryan Adams]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Willie Nelson]]) for ''These Magnificent Miles''. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] is quoted as saying that this album was inspired by \"the circus life of a band on the road.\" Current guitarist Eric Hall began his career with Red Wanting Blue during this time period. The band settled into an Americana rock \u2018n\u2019 roll vibe utilizing more melodic sounds than that of their prior work. Drummer Dean Anshutz joined the band toward the end of this album cycle.\n\nAfter signing with Fanatic Records in April 2010, ''These Magnificent Miles'' was re-released nationally on July 27, 2010, for a wider audience. Fanatic also issued a deluxe double-LP edition of ''These Magnificent Miles'' with full-color LP sleeves featuring the art of John Terry ([[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]]'s brother). In September 2010, the single \"Where You Wanna Go\" was heard on radio stations across the country. An eccentric music video was released for \"Where You Wanna Go\" featuring the band finding themselves trapped in an Alice in Wonderland type setting. Red Wanting Blue settled into a rhythm on tour of nearly selling out venues in advance (large rock clubs and mid-sized theaters), most shows during this time period selling out by day of show. The band's following in major cities like NYC started doubling in size with each live concert.\n\nRed Wanting Blue was commissioned to write a song for the film \"Unraveled\". The song called \"Magic Man\" was released as a single and is played in its entirety during the film. The documentary \"These Magnificent Miles \u2013 On the Long Road with Red Wanting Blue\" was released in April 2011. The band does not sell or support the documentary. On April 13, 2011, lead singer [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] was the guest star on [[NPR]] Radio's Snap Judgement and told a story about the band traveling through Yellowstone National Park and running into \"trouble\". In June 2011 Red Wanting Blue was presented with the Key to the City from the mayor of Kearney, Nebraska.\n\n===''From The Vanishing Point'' (2011\u20132014)===\n[[File:Red Wanting Blue band, 2012.jpg|thumb|Red Wanting Blue, 2012. Photo by Jason Tanaka Blaney]]\nIn early 2011, the band headed into the studio to begin recording their second official label release (RWB's 9th album). Once again, the band enlisted the talents of Jamie Candiloro to produce the album. The title of the album was released on August 5, 2011, through social media outlets. ''From the Vanishing Point'' was originally slated for release in the fall of 2011, but the album release was pushed back to January 2012.<ref name=\"PittPost Gazette06072012\" /> In the weeks before its release ''From the Vanishing Point'' was streamed over 80,000 times in the month of October alone. Over 150,000 streams of the album were recorded by the turn of 2012. \"From the Vanishing Point\" landed at ''#10 on The ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Chart'' in its first official week of release.<ref name=\"Heatseekers 2012\" /> The singles \"Audition,\" \"Stay on the Bright Side\" and \"White Snow\" were released on [[Adult Album Alternative]] radio also known as AAAradio or Triple-A. The music video for \"Audition\" was shot live, in one-take on October 13 at the Newport Music Hall in Columbus, OH. The intention was to introduce the authentic live energy of the band without including the \"Hollywood magic\" that is involved in most \"live-style\" music videos. In November 2011, Red Wanting Blue along with producer Jamie Candiloro headed back into the studio to record \"[[You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch]]\" as a holiday treat for their fans. The song found its way to the radio and was picked up as a holiday single. Music Choice Television also picked up the song as a holiday single.<ref name=\"music choice\">[http://www.rtbot.net/fanatic_records Fanatic Records Information, Videos, Pictures and News.]</ref>\n\nRWB's album release tour kicked off in January 2012 and consisted of several months of sold-out shows from Chicago to New York City and more. This time proved to be the band's most successful period of touring to date with concerts selling out weeks in advance. In the morning, before most tour stops, the band could be heard making special appearances on the local radio stations (most included an interview and two to three songs). Red Wanting Blue also performed on [[The Rock Boat]] in March as well as several shows with friends and fellow musicians [[Carbon Leaf]]. On June 29, 2012 RWB's live concert attendance record was broken in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Over 9,000 people attended the outdoor concert dubbed \"Red Wanting Blue - Rocking on the River\" in support of the band. On April 13, \"Unraveled\", the film that features RWB's \"Magic Man\", was released theatrically (later debuting on [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] on August 8.) On July 10, the band made available a free download of their concert from NYC venue City Winery.\n\nOn July 18, Red Wanting Blue made their network television debut on the [[Late Show with David Letterman]]<ref name=\"Tribune06072012\" /> performing the song \"Audition\" to an audience that roared and cheered along. On Sept 17th RWB performed their debut session on Daytrotter.com. On October 1, 2012, the band announced they would be performing and appearing live on [[VH1]]'s morning show \"Big Morning Buzz Live\" on October 16 at 10am alongside [[Bruno Mars]] and [[Jason Aldean]]. On November 5 Red Wanting Blue performed live on the [[NPR]] radio program [[Mountain Stage]] alongside [[Dr. Dog]] and [[The Mountain Goats]] at the Keith Albee Theater in West Virginia.\n\nIn early 2013, RWB headlined a tour of the west coast and continued to sell out shows throughout the Midwest and east coast. They also toured eastern Canada with [[The Trews]] and hit a major milestone by selling out [[The Bowery Ballroom]] in New York City. At ''The Bowery Ballroom'' on March 9, Red Wanting Blue announced that they would be heading back into the studio with producer/friend Jamie Candiloro throughout March and April 2013 to record their 10th album.\n\nThroughout March, April and May 2013, Red Wanting Blue returned to their recording studio (\"El Rancho Relaxo\" in Columbus, Ohio) with Jamie Candiloro to produce their tenth album. This had been the longest amount of time ever scheduled off the road (for the purpose of recording) in the band's career. In September, RWB announced their fall tour dates with longtime friend [[Will Hoge]]. Red Wanting Blue chose [[Swear and Shake]] to open several dates on this fall tour entitled \"The Dime Store Circus Tour\".\n\nIn February 2014 Red Wanting Blue officially sold out their first two-night stint at the House of Blues In Cleveland, Ohio. They performed their \"love songs\" on the February 14 concert in honor of Valentine's Day and performed their full rock and roll show on February 15. The band played several rare songs from their early albums during these concerts.\n\nOn February 22 the band set sail for their 3rd appearance on [[The Rock Boat]]. Red Wanting Blue played on the theatre and pool deck stages. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] was invited to perform at the \"Campfire Story Sessions\" where he performed solo with his ukulele and told the true stories behind the songs  \"Probably Nothing\", \"Jennifear\" and a never before performed song called \"Little America.\" Ken Block and Drew Copland (of [[Sister Hazel]]), Emerson Hart (of [[Tonic (band)|Tonic]]) and [[Edwin McCain]] sang harmony on \"Jennifear\" as Scott Terry expressed several times how honored he was to be in their company.\n\n===''Little America'' (2014 \u2013 2016)===\nOn July 1, 2014, Red Wanting Blue released their tenth studio album titled ''Little America''. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;3 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Heatseekers Chart and No.&nbsp;31 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock Chart. The album was recorded in Columbus, Ohio and Los Angeles, California, produced by Jamie Candiloro and mastered by Greg Calbi at Sterling Sound in NYC. Guest appearances include [[Ed Kowalczyk]] (of [[Live (band)]]), Kerri Spieler (of [[Swear and Shake]]) and Tim Hanseroth (of [[Brandi Carlile]]). A music video was released for the single ''You Are My Las Vegas'' starring the band member's real-life mothers. In the video, the moms physically transform into their sons (beards and all) and perform the song in character.\n\nTo celebrate the release of ''Little America'', RWB hit the road with longtime friends [[The Alternate Routes]]. The ''Sounds Like Summer U.S. Tour'' started in July 2014. In November, 2014 ''RWB'' hit the road with New Orleans band [[The Revivalists]] for a tour of the east coast and midwest. On Dec 4, 2014, ''Red Wanting Blue'' performed a special concert at [[Trinity Cathedral (Cleveland, Ohio)|Trinity Cathedral]] in Cleveland, Ohio. The performance consisted of both acoustic and electric sets and was recorded for the Cathedral Concert Series for [[PBS]] (rumored to air in March 2015).\n\nIn January, 2015, the band set sail to perform on the floating music festival ''Cayamo'' that featured [[John Prine]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Brandi Carlile]], [[Kacey Musgraves]], [[The Lone Bellow]], and more. Directly after ''Cayamo'', the band boarded ''The Rock Boat XV'' for their fourth consecutive year. The band performed alongside hosts [[Sister Hazel]], [[Barenaked Ladies]], longtime friends [[Alternate Routes]], [[Will Hoge]], and more. [[Scott Terry (musician)|Scott Terry]] hosted the popular Rock Boat Songwriter Sessions and performed two brand new songs titled \"Holy Rolling Thunder\" and \"No Place To Go But Down\".\n\n''RWB'' hit the road in the spring/summer of 2015 on a tour called \"Our Little America Tour\". The tour began in Northwest Canada and ended in Boston. During this time they shared the stage with friends [[The Trews]] and [[The Alternate Routes]]. They debuted two new songs during this tour titled \"High and Dry\" and \"Holy Rolling Thunder\".\n\n===''RWB20 Live at Lincoln Theater'' (since 2016)===\n\nThis live concert film was recorded live at the Lincoln Theater in [[Columbus, Ohio]] on October 14, 2016. The double disc ''RWB20'' film and album was released only two months later, on December 16, 2016. The film was directed by ''Jenna Pace'' and the album was produced by ''Greg Rahm''. The film's purpose was to celebrate the first 20 years of ''Red Wanting Blue''. The concert started with a brand new song and proceeded to go back in time, playing re-worked versions of songs dating back to 1996.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"3\"\n|-\n!

The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=13}} It reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA Victor record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling.{{sfn|Adelman|2002|pp=13\u201315}} In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, \"especially on legal documents\".{{sfn|Nash|2005|p=11}} Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's Outstanding Young Men used Aaron.

Known as the \"'''King of Rock and Roll'''\", he is regarded as [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley|one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century]]. Presley's energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a [[civil rights movement|transformative era in race relations]], brought both great success and [[Cultural impact of Elvis Presley#Danger to American culture|initial controversy]].\n\nPresley was born in [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]; his family relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]], when he was 13. His music career began there in 1954, at [[Sun Records]] with producer [[Sam Phillips]], who wanted to bring the sound of [[African-American music]] to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist [[Scotty Moore]] and bassist [[Bill Black]], was a pioneer of [[rockabilly]], an uptempo, [[Backbeat (music)|backbeat]]-driven fusion of [[country music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. In 1955, drummer [[D. J. Fontana]] joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and [[RCA Victor]] acquired his contract in a deal arranged by [[Colonel Tom Parker]], who managed him for the rest of his life. Presley's first RCA Victor single, \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the US. Within a year, RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular [[rock and roll]]; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans<ref name=\":00\" /> led to him being widely considered a [[moral panic|threat]] to the moral well-being of [[White Americans|white American]] youth.{{sfn|Brown|Broeske|1997|p=55}}\n\nIn November 1956, Presley made his film debut in ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]''. Drafted into [[Military career of Elvis Presley|military service in 1958]], he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley's most famous films included ''[[Jailhouse Rock (film)|Jailhouse Rock]]'' (1957), ''[[Blue Hawaii]]'' (1961), and ''[[Viva Las Vegas]]'' (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special ''[[Elvis (1968 TV program)|Elvis]]'', which led to an extended [[Las Vegas]] concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, ''[[Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite|Aloha from Hawaii]]''. However, years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his [[Graceland]] estate at the age of 42.\n\nPresley is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time, with sales estimated around 500&nbsp;million records worldwide.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=sales}} He was commercially successful in many genres, including [[Traditional pop|pop]], country, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, [[adult contemporary]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. He won three [[Grammy Awards]], received the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] at age 36, and has been inducted into [[List of halls of fame inducting Elvis Presley|multiple music halls of fame]]. He holds several records, including the most [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]-certified [[RIAA certification|gold]] and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and the most number-one singles by any act on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

I was very [[shyness|shy]] about it.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=23}}\n\nIn September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade. The following year, he began singing and playing his guitar at school. He was often teased as a \"trashy\" kid who played [[hillbilly music]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=23\u201326}} Presley was a devotee of [[Mississippi Slim (country singer)|Mississippi Slim]]'s radio show. He was described as \"crazy about music\" by Slim's younger brother, one of Presley's classmates.

By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=44, 46, 51}} He competed in Humes' Annual \"Minstrel\" Show in 1953, singing and playing \"[[Till I Waltz Again with You]]\", a recent hit for [[Teresa Brewer]]. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: <blockquote>I wasn't popular in school&nbsp;... I failed music\u2014only thing I ever failed.

He aimed to pay for studio time to record a two-sided [[acetate disc]]: \"[[My Happiness (popular song)|My Happiness]]\" and \"[[That's When Your Heartaches Begin]]\". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he \"sounded like\". Biographer [[Peter Guralnick]] argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=62\u201364}} In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sun\u2014\"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\" and \"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\"\u2014but again nothing came of it.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=65}} Not long after, he failed an [[audition]] for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows,{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=77}} and another for the band of [[Eddie Bond]].{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=83}}\n{{Listen|type=speech|filename=That's All Right.ogg|title=\"That's All Right\" |description=Presley transformed not only the sound but the emotion of the song, turning what had been written as a \"lament for a lost love into a satisfied declaration of independence.\"{{sfn|Marcus|1982|p=174}}}}\nPhillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.{{sfn|Miller|2000|p=72}} In June, he acquired a demo recording by [[Jimmy Sweeney]] of a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist [[Scotty Moore|Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore]] and [[double bass|upright bass]] player [[Bill Black]], to work with Presley for a recording session.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=10\u201311}} The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's \"[[That's All Right]]\". Moore recalled, \"All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them.\" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=94\u201397}} Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey [[Dewey Phillips]] (no relation to Sam Phillips) played \"That's All Right\" on his ''Red, Hot, and Blue'' show.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=43}} Listener interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100\u2013101}} During the next few days, the trio recorded a [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song, [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\", again in a distinctive style and employing a [[jury rigging|jury-rigged]] [[Delay (audio effect)|echo effect]] that Sam Phillips dubbed \"slapback\". A single was pressed with \"That's All Right\" on the A-side and \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" on the reverse.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=102\u2013104}}\n\n==== Early live performances and RCA Victor contract ====\nThe trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=105, 139}} Later that month, they appeared at the [[Overton Park#Levitt Shell|Overton Park Shell]], with [[Slim Whitman]] headlining. Here Elvis pioneered \"[[Rubber legs|Rubber Legs]]\", his signature dance movement.{{sfn|Miller|2021}}{{sfn|Rodman|2013|p=151}} A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: His wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=106, 108\u2013111}} Moore recalled, \"During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mic and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=110}}\n\nSoon after, Moore and Black left their old band to play with Presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter [[Bob Neal (promoter)|Bob Neal]] became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue in Memphis. When Presley played, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house [[western swing]] band resumed.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=139}} Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, \"His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=119}} Amid these live performances, Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=117\u2013127, 131}} Presley made what would be his only appearance on [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]'s ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' on October 2; ''Opry'' manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was \"not bad\" but did not suit the program.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=128\u2013130}}{{sfn|Mason|2007|pp=37\u201338}}\n\n==== ''Louisiana Hayride'', radio commercial, and first television performances ====\nIn November 1954, Presley performed on ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''\u2014the ''Opry''{{'}}s chief, and more adventurous, rival. The show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. His nervous first set drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=127\u2013128, 135\u2013142}} Soon after the show, the ''Hayride'' engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8, he purchased a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] instrument for $175 ({{Inflation|US|175|1954|fmt=eq|r=-2}}) and his trio began playing in new locales, including [[Houston]], Texas, and [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]], Arkansas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=152, 156, 182}} Presley made his first television appearance on the [[KSLA-TV]] broadcast of ''Louisiana Hayride''. Soon after, he failed an audition for ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts]]'' on the [[CBS]] television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular ''Hayride'' appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=144, 159, 167\u2013168}}{{sfn|Nash|2003|pp=6\u201312}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley - TV Radio Mirror, September 1956 01.jpg|thumb|230px|Presley performing with [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] in 1956]]\nIn January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of [[Colonel Tom Parker]], whom he considered the best promoter in the music business.

Some of the songs, like \"That's All Right\", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the \"R&B idiom of negro field jazz\"; others, like \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", were \"more in the country field\", \"but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=163}} This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because \"he sounded too much like a [[hillbilly]].\"{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=104}} The blend came to be known as \"rockabilly\". At the time, Presley was billed as \"The King of Western Bop\", \"The Hillbilly Cat\", and \"The Memphis Flash\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=53}}\n\nPresley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|p=45}} The group maintained an extensive touring schedule.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=29}} Neal recalled, \"It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys.

There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him.\"{{sfn|Rogers|1982|p=41}} The trio became a quartet when ''Hayride'' drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of [[Bill Haley]], whose \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=217\u2013219}}\n\nAt the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=31}} After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with [[RCA Victor]] on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28\u201329}}{{refn|Of the $40,000, $5,000 covered back royalties owed by Sun.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|pp=28\u201329}}|name=royalties|group=lower-alpha}} Presley, aged 20, was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract.{{sfn|Escott|1998|p=421}} Parker arranged with the owners of [[Hill & Range]] Publishing, [[Jean Aberbach|Jean]] and [[Julian Aberbach]], to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley.

The program, produced in New York City, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers [[Tommy Dorsey|Tommy]] and [[Jimmy Dorsey]]. After his first appearance on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victor's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a [[cover song|cover]] of [[Carl Perkins]]' rockabilly anthem \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\". In February, Presley's \"[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget]]\", a Sun recording released the previous August, reached the top of the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' country chart]].{{sfn|Slaughter|Nixon|2004|p=21}} Neal's contract was terminated and Parker became Presley's manager.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=50, 54, 64}}\n\nRCA Victor released Presley's [[Elvis Presley (album)|self-titled debut album]] on March 23.

As described by Hilburn, these <blockquote>were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists&nbsp;... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.{{sfn|Hilburn|2005}}</blockquote> It became the first rock and roll album to top the ''Billboard'' chart, a position it held for ten weeks.{{sfn|Stanley|Coffey|1998|p=30}} While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Chuck Berry]], cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, \"of Elvis having the time of his life on stage ''with a guitar in his hands'' played a crucial role in positioning the guitar&nbsp;... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.\"{{sfn|Rodman|1996|p=28}}\n\n==== ''Milton Berle Show'' and \"Hound Dog\" ====\n[[File:Elvis signs autographs in Minneapolis 1956.jpg|thumb|left|Presley signing autographs in [[Minneapolis]] in 1956]]\nOn April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]''.

The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the \"biggest pop craze\" since [[Glenn Miller]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]&nbsp; and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: <blockquote>As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed.&nbsp;...

Also known as ''Welcome Home Elvis'', the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=44, 62\u201363}}\n\n''[[G.I. Blues (album)|G.I.

His first LP of sacred material, ''[[His Hand in Mine]]'', followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for twenty-four local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 114}} A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, ''[[Something for Everybody]]''.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=148}} According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the [[Nashville sound]], the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley over the next half-decade, the album is largely \"a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis' birthright\".{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=52}} It would be his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, for a [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]] memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven years.{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=110, 119}}\n\n==== Lost in Hollywood ====\nParker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted [[musical comedy|musical comedies]]. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic vein\u2014''[[Flaming Star]]'' (1960) and ''[[Wild in the Country]]'' (1961)\u2014were less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=133}} His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a \"pantheon of bad taste\".{{sfn|Caine|2005|p=21}} Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. [[Hal Wallis]], who produced nine, declared, \"A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood.\"{{sfn|Fields|2007}}\n\nOf Presley's films in the 1960s, fifteen were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedules\u2014Presley frequently starred in three a year\u2014affected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: \"three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=449}} As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew \"progressively worse\".{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=67}} [[Julie Parrish]], who appeared in ''[[Paradise, Hawaiian Style]]'' (1966), says that Presley disliked many of the songs.{{sfn|Lisanti|2000|pp=19, 136}} The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone: \"The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=201}} Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of [[Doc Pomus]] and [[Mort Shuman]]. But by and large, according to biographer [[Jerry Hopkins (author)|Jerry Hopkins]], the numbers seemed to be \"written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll\".{{sfn|Hopkins|2002|p=32}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley and Priscilla with Lisa Marie February 1968.jpg|thumb|274x274px|Presley and his wife, [[Priscilla Presley]], holding their newborn daughter, [[Lisa Marie Presley]], in 1968]]\nIn the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as \"[[Can't Help Falling in Love]]\" (1961) and \"[[Return to Sender (song)|Return to Sender]]\" (1962). However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 through 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: \"[[Crying in the Chapel]]\" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of ''[[Pot Luck (Elvis Presley album)|Pot Luck]]'' and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967). It won him his first [[Grammy Award]], for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was \"arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs\".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=650}}\n\nShortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the [[Aladdin (hotel and casino)|Aladdin Hotel]] in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=261\u2013263}} The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks continued. It was not until October 1967, when the [[Clambake (soundtrack)|''Clambake'' soundtrack LP]] registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA Victor executives recognized a problem. \"By then, of course, the damage had been done\", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. \"Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans.\"{{sfn|Kirchberg|Hendrickx|1999|p=73}}\n\n=== 1968\u20131973: Comeback ===\n==== ''Elvis'': the '68 Comeback Special ====\n{{Main|Singer Presents...Elvis}}\n[[File:Elvis Presley 68 Comeback Special.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Presley, wearing a tight black leather jacket with Napoleonic standing collar, black leather wristbands, and black leather pants, holds a microphone with a long cord.

Parker had already shifted his plans to television: he maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=4}}\n\nRecorded in late June in [[Burbank, California]], the special, simply called ''Elvis'', aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audience\u2014Presley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer [[Steve Binder]] worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=293, 296}} The show, NBC's highest-rated that season, captured forty-two percent of the total viewing audience.{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} [[Jon Landau]] of ''Eye'' magazine remarked: <blockquote>There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made [[Jim Morrison]] green with envy.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=215}}</blockquote> Marsh calls the performance one of \"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\".{{sfn|Marsh|2004|p=649}}\n\nBy January 1969, the single \"[[If I Can Dream]]\", written for the special, reached number 12. The [[NBC-TV Special|soundtrack album]] rose into the top ten. According to friend [[Jerry Schilling]], the special reminded Presley of what \"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack.&nbsp;... He was out of prison, man.\"{{sfn|Kubernick|2008|p=26}} Binder said of Presley's reaction, \"I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life.

Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is \"a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1980|p=396}} The album featured the hit single \"[[In the Ghetto]]\", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chart\u2014Presley's first non-gospel top ten hit since \"Bossa Nova Baby\" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: \"[[Suspicious Minds]]\", \"[[Don't Cry Daddy]]\", and \"[[Kentucky Rain]]\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=419}}\n\nPresley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the ''Comeback Special'', offers came in from around the world. The [[London Palladium]] offered Parker {{US$|28,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|28000|1969|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) for a one-week engagement. He responded, \"That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?\"{{sfn|Gordon|2005|p=146}} In May, the brand-new [[Las Vegas Hilton|International Hotel]] in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, booked Presley for fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist [[James Burton]] and including two gospel groups, [[The Imperials]] and [[Sweet Inspirations]].{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=283}} Costume designer [[Bill Belew]], responsible for the intense leather styling of the ''Comeback Special'', created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by his passion for karate.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=343}} Nonetheless, Presley was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker oversaw a major promotional push, and International Hotel owner [[Kirk Kerkorian]] arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=346\u2013347}}\n\nPresley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" (which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life).{{sfn|Gordon|2005|pp=149\u2013150}} At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as \"The King\", Presley gestured toward [[Fats Domino]], who was taking in the scene. \"No,\" Presley said, \"that's the real king of rock and roll.\"{{sfn|Cook|2004|p=39}} The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Guralnick|Jorgensen|1999|pp=259, 262}} ''[[Newsweek]]'' commented, \"There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.\"{{sfn|Moyer|2002|p=73}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' called Presley \"supernatural, his own resurrection.\"{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=287}} In November, Presley's final non-concert film, ''[[Change of Habit]]'', opened. The double album ''[[From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis]]'' came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. \"Suspicious Minds\" reached the top of the charts\u2014Presley's first [[Billboard Hot 100|U.S. pop number-one]] in over seven years, and his last.{{sfn|Whitburn|2010|pp=521\u2013522}}\n\n[[Cassandra Peterson]], later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas.

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless {{US$|50,000|link=yes}} ({{Inflation|US|50000|1970|fmt=eq|r=-3}}) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.{{sfn|Hopkins|2007|p=253}} The FBI took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows.

As music historian John Robertson noted, <blockquote>The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white pop\u2014perfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.{{sfn|Robertson|2004|p=70}}</blockquote> After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the [[Southern United States|South]], his first since 1958.

Twice during the year he overdosed on [[barbiturate]]s, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. In late 1973, he was hospitalized from the effects of a [[pethidine]] addiction. According to his primary care physician, [[George C. Nichopoulos]], Presley \"felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street\".{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.{{sfn|Keogh|2004|p=238}} Despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=481, 487, 499, 504, 519\u2013520}}\n\nPresley's condition declined precipitously that September.

The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered \"[[anaphylactic shock]] brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy\". Lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that [[polypharmacy]] was the primary cause of death; one reported \"fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=651\u2013653}} In 1979, forensic pathologist [[Cyril Wecht]] reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of [[depressant]]s had resulted in Presley's accidental death.{{sfn|Ramsland|2010}} Forensic historian and pathologist [[Michael Baden]] viewed the situation as complicated: \"Elvis had  an [[Cardiomegaly|enlarged heart]] for a long time.

It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}}\n\nIn 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as [[Miami-Dade County]] coroner,{{sfn|Tennant|2013|p=2}} declared at its completion, \"There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack.\"{{sfn|Higginbotham|2002}} More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff \"could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then.\"{{sfn|Williamson|2015|pp=11\u201314}} One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, <blockquote>could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached.&nbsp;... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body&nbsp;... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with [[diabetes]], glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs.

Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,{{sfn|Bertrand|2000|p=211}} and, as Stoller put it, \"He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.\"{{sfn|Fox|1986|p=179}} At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, \"I know practically every religious song that's ever been written.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=430}}\n\n=== Musicianship ===\nPresley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear.{{sfn|Graceland Blog|2015}} Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA Victor albums.

In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP ''[[Peace in the Valley (EP)|Peace in the Valley]]''. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.{{sfn|Wolfe|1994|p=14}} Presley would record gospel periodically for the rest of his life.\n{{Listen|type=music|filename=Run On.ogg|title=\"Run On\" |description=From ''[[How Great Thou Art (Elvis Presley album)|How Great Thou Art]]'' (1967), a traditional song popular in the black gospel tradition.

His first post-Army single, the number-one hit \"Stuck on You\", is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its \"mild rock beat\"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it \"upbeat pop\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=123}} The number five \"[[She's Not You]]\" (1962) \"integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop\".{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=145}} The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on ''Elvis Is Back!'' was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966\u201367 recordings as \"[[Down in the Alley (The Clovers song)|Down in the Alley]]\" and \"[[Hi-Heel Sneakers]]\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=213, 237}} Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", a number-one in 1960. \"It's Now or Never\", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song \"{{lang|nap|[['O sole mio]]|italic=no}}\" and concluding with a \"full-voiced operatic cadence\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=65}} These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|pp=142\u2013143}}\n\nWhile Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the ''[['68 Comeback Special]]'', the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become \"hard to find\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=343}} A significant exception was \"Burning Love\", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and [[funk]]. Much of ''Elvis in Memphis'', as well as \"Suspicious Minds\", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.{{sfn|Ponce de Leon|2007|p=199}}\n\n=== Vocal style and range ===\n[[File:Elvis Presley first national television appearance 1956.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Publicity photo of Elvis playing guitar|Publicity photo for the [[CBS]] program ''[[Stage Show (TV series)|Stage Show]]'', January 16, 1956]]\n\nThe developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from \"high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1982|p=234}} Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the \"vocal stutter\" on 1955's \"[[Baby Let's Play House]]\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=317}} When on \"Don't Be Cruel\", Presley \"slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses,\" he shows \"how masterful his relaxed style really is.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=91}} Marsh describes the vocal performance on \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" as one of \"gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing\", with the line {{\"'}}Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal\".{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=490}}\n\nJorgensen calls the 1966 recording of \"How Great Thou Art\" \"an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions\", as Presley \"crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax\", becoming \"a kind of one-man quartet\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=212}} Guralnick finds \"[[Stand by Me (Charles Albert Tindley song)|Stand by Me]]\" from the same gospel sessions \"a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance\", but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on \"Where No One Stands Alone\", resorting \"to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound\" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, \"he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=232}} Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: \"The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=231}}\n\nMarsh praises his 1968 reading of \"[[U.S. Male]]\", \"bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records.\"{{sfn|Marsh|1989|p=424}} The performance on \"In the Ghetto\" is, according to Jorgensen, \"devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms\", instead relying on the exceptional \"clarity and sensitivity of his voice\".{{sfn|Jorgensen|1998|p=271}} Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of \"almost translucent eloquence&nbsp;... so quietly confident in its simplicity\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=332}} On \"Suspicious Minds\", Guralnick hears essentially the same \"remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise\", but supplemented with \"an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)\".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=335}}\n\nMusic critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] observes that \"Presley has been described variously as a [[baritone]] and a [[tenor]]. An extraordinary compass&nbsp;... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion.\"{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two [[octave]]s and a third, \"from the baritone low [[G (musical note)|G]] to the tenor high [[B (musical note)|B]], with an upward extension in [[falsetto]] to at least a D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down.\"{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} In Pleasants' view, his voice was \"variable and unpredictable\" at the bottom, \"often brilliant\" at the top, with the capacity for \"full-voiced high Gs and [[A (musical note)|As]] that an opera baritone might envy\".{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}} Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that \"his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all.\"{{sfn|Waters|2003|p=205}} Presley was always \"able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers\", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.{{sfn|Pleasants|2004|p=260}}\n\n== Public image ==\n=== Relationship with the African-American community ===\n[[File:BillyWard n Elvis Presley circa 1955.jpg|thumb|Elvis Presley and [[Billy Ward (singer)|Billy Ward]], circa 1955]]\nWhen Dewey Phillips first aired \"That's All Right\" on Memphis' [[WHBQ (AM)|WHBQ]], many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|pp=100\u2013101}} From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician [[Arthur Crudup]]\u2014the originator of \"That's All Right\"\u2014\"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} ''The Memphis World'', an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley \"cracked Memphis' segregation laws\" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its \"colored night\".{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}} In contrast, many white adults \"did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.\"<ref name=\":00\" />\n\nDespite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had announced, \"The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes.\" A journalist with the national African American weekly ''[[Jet magazine|Jet]]'', Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of ''Jailhouse Rock'', Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: <blockquote>I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it.&nbsp;... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that.{{sfn|Williams|2012}}</blockquote> Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.{{sfn|Guralnick|2004}}{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Blues singer [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland, reported of Presley, \"He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest.\"{{sfn|Guralnick|1994|p=426}} Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.{{sfn|Kolawole|2002}}\n\nThe persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.{{sfn|Pilgrim|2006}} Into the 21st century, the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music still found adherents.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ushe |first1=Naledi |title=Appropriation or appreciation?

Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, \"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that.

But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force.&nbsp;... Elvis' breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.{{sfn|New York Times|2002}}</blockquote>\n\nHe was ranked third on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of greatest artists. [[Bono]] wrote in appreciation: <blockquote>In Elvis, you have the blueprint for rock & roll. The highness \u2014 the gospel highs. The mud \u2014 the Delta mud, the blues. Sexual liberation. Controversy. Changing the way people feel about the world. It's all there with Elvis.{{sfn|Bono|2010|loc=\"Elvis\"}}</blockquote>\n\n Not only Presley's achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus:<blockquote>Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons.&nbsp;... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues.&nbsp;... Elvis has emerged as a great ''artist'', a great ''rocker'', a great ''purveyor of schlock'', a great ''heart throb'', a great ''bore'', a great ''symbol of potency'', a great ''ham'', a great ''nice person'', and, yes, a great American.{{sfn|Marcus|1982|pp=141\u2013142}}</blockquote>\n\n== Achievements ==\nHaving sold about 500 million records worldwide, Presley is one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]] of all time.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|name=sales|The estimates of Elvis Presley's record sales vary from 500 million \u2013 1 billion records worldwide.{{sfn|Reuters|2022}}<ref>{{cite book|title= Brandstorm: Surviving and Thriving in the New Consumer-Led Marketplace|publisher=[[ Macmillan Publishers]]|page=77|author=Liz Nickles, Savita Iyer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/14/us/elvis-presley-1968-comeback-guitar-auction/index.html|title= An iconic guitar from Elvis Presley's Comeback Special is up for auction|date=14 March 2021|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>}} Presley's rankings for top ten and number-one hits vary depending on how the double-sided \"Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel\" and \"Don't/I Beg of You\" singles, which precede the inception of ''Billboard''{{'}}s unified [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart, are analyzed.{{refn|Whitburn follows actual ''Billboard'' history in considering the four songs on the \"Don't Be Cruel/Hound Dog\" and \"Don't/I Beg of You\" singles as distinct.

''Billboard'' now considers both singles as unified items, ignoring the historical sales split of the former and its old Top 100 chart entirely. Whitburn thus analyzes the four songs as yielding three number ones and a total of four top tens.

Nicknamed \"'''The Killer'''\", he was described as \"[[rock 'n' roll]]'s first great wild man\". A pioneer of rock and roll and [[rockabilly]] music, Lewis made his first recordings in 1952 at [[Cosimo Matassa]]'s J&M Studio in [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, and early recordings in 1956 at [[Sun Records]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. \"[[Crazy Arms]]\" sold 300,000 copies in the Southern United States, but it was his 1957 hit \"[[Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On]]\" that shot Lewis to worldwide fame. He followed this with the major hits \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", \"[[Breathless (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|Breathless]]\", and \"[[High School Confidential (Jerry Lee Lewis song)|High School Confidential]]\".\n\nHis rock and roll career faltered in the wake of his marriage to [[Myra Gale Brown]], his 13-year-old first cousin once removed. His popularity quickly eroded following the scandal, and with few exceptions, such as a cover of [[Ray Charles]]'s \"[[What'd I Say]]\", he did not have much chart success in the early 1960s. His live performances at this time were increasingly wild and energetic. His 1964 live album ''[[Live at the Star Club, Hamburg]]'' is regarded by many music journalists and fans as one of the wildest and greatest live rock albums ever. In 1968, Lewis made a transition into [[country music]] and had hits with songs such as \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\". This reignited his career, and throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, he regularly topped the country-western charts; throughout his seven-decade career, Lewis had 30 songs reach the Top 10 on the [[Hot Country Songs|''Billboard'' Country and Western Chart]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Myers |first=Marc |date=October 24, 2014 |title=Jerry Lee Lewis, the Enduring Rebel of Rock 'n' Roll |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |website=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=March 8, 2017 |archive-date=March 21, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321082649/https://www.wsj.com/articles/jerry-lee-lewis-the-enduring-rebel-of-rocknroll-1413908005 |url-status=live }}</ref> His No. 1 country hits included \"[[To Make Love Sweeter for You]]\", \"[[There Must Be More to Love Than This (song)|There Must Be More to Love Than This]]\", \"[[Would You Take Another Chance on Me]]\", and \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\".\n\nLewis's successes continued throughout the decades, and he embraced his rock and roll past with songs such as a cover of [[The Big Bopper]]'s \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" and [[Mack Vickery]]'s \"Rockin' My Life Away\". In the 21st century, Lewis continued to tour worldwide and released new albums. His 2006 album ''[[Last Man Standing (Jerry Lee Lewis album)|Last Man Standing]]'' was his best-selling release, with over a million copies worldwide. This was followed by ''[[Mean Old Man]]'' in 2010, another of his bestselling albums.\n\nLewis had a dozen [[Music recording certification|gold records]] in rock and country. He won four Grammy awards, including a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and two [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] Awards. Lewis was inducted into the inaugural class of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1986, and his pioneering contribution to the genre was recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. He was also a member of the inaugural class inducted into the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memphis Music Hall of Fame |url=http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |access-date=October 12, 2016 |website=Memphismusichalloffame.com |archive-date=October 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009220210/http://memphismusichalloffame.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2022.

He grew up in an impoverished farming family in Eastern Louisiana. In his youth, he began playing the piano with two of his cousins, [[Mickey Gilley]] (later a popular country music singer) and [[Jimmy Swaggart]] (later a popular televangelist). His parents [[Mortgage loan|mortgaged]] their farm to buy him a piano. Lewis was influenced by a piano-playing older cousin, [[Carl McVoy]] (who later recorded with [[Bill Black]]'s Combo), the radio, and the sounds from Haney's Big House, a black [[juke joint]] across the tracks.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 16, 2004 |title=Natchez Under The Hill Saloon \u2013 Natchez Mississippi |url=http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040716210854/http://www.underthehillsaloon.com/custom/webpage.cfm?content=newsletter&id=50 |archive-date=July 16, 2004 |access-date=July 11, 2015 |publisher=Underthehillsaloon.com}}</ref> On November 19, 1949, Lewis made his first public performance of his career, playing with a [[country and western]] band at a car dealership in Ferriday.

When Lewis daringly played a [[boogie-woogie]] rendition of \"My God Is Real\" at a church assembly, it ended his association with the school the same night. Pearry Green, then president of the student body, related how during a talent show Lewis played some \"worldly\" music. The next morning, the [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the school called Lewis and Green into his office to expel them.

In December 1956, Lewis began recording prolifically as a solo artist and as a [[session musician]] for other Sun artists, including [[Carl Perkins]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. His distinctive piano playing can be heard on many tracks recorded at Sun in late 1956 and early 1957, including Carl Perkins's \"[[Matchbox (song)|Matchbox]]\", \"[[Your True Love]]\", and \"Put Your Cat Clothes On\" and [[Billy Lee Riley]]'s \"Flyin' Saucers Rock'n'Roll\".\n\nOn December 4, 1956, [[Elvis Presley]] dropped in on Phillips to pay a social visit while Perkins was in the studio cutting new tracks with Lewis backing him on piano.

In 2005, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" was selected for permanent preservation in the [[National Recording Registry]] of the [[Library of Congress]].

The results were sonically astonishing, with Bonomo observing, \"Detractors complain of the album's crashing noisiness, the lack of subtlety with which Jerry Lee revisits the songs, the fact that the piano is mixed too loudly, but what is certain is that Siggi Loch on this spring evening captured something brutally honest about the Killer, about the primal and timeless centre of the very best rock & roll...\" The album showcases Lewis's skills as a pianist and singer, honed by relentless touring. In a 5-out-of-5-stars review, Milo Miles wrote in ''Rolling Stone'' magazine that \"''Live at the Star Club, Hamburg'' is not an album, it's a crime scene: Jerry Lee Lewis slaughters his rivals in a thirteen-song set that feels like one long convulsion.\"\n\n===Country comeback===\n[[File:Carl Perkins Roy Orbison Johnny Cash Jerry Lee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|left|Lewis performing with [[Roy Orbison]], [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Carl Perkins]] on ''The Johnny Cash Christmas Special'' in November 1977]]\nFrustrated by Smash's inability to score a hit, Lewis was planning on leaving the label when promotions manager [[Eddie Kilroy]] pitched the idea of cutting a pure country record in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. With nothing to lose, Lewis agreed to record the [[Jerry Chesnut]] song \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\", which was released as a single on March 9, 1968, and, to everyone's amazement, shot up the country charts. At the time of the release, Lewis had been playing [[Iago]] in a rock and roll adaptation of ''Othello'' called ''Catch My Soul'' in Los Angeles but was soon rushed back to Nashville to record another batch of songs with producer [[Jerry Kennedy]]. What followed was a string of hits that no one could have predicted, although country music always remained a major part of Lewis's repertoire. As Colin Escott observes in the sleeve to the 1995 compilation ''Killer Country'', the conversion to country music in 1968 \"looked at the time like a radical shift, but it was neither as abrupt nor as unexpected as it seemed. Jerry had always recorded country music, and his country breakthrough 'Another Place, Another Time' had been preceded by countless country records starting with his first, '[[Crazy Arms]]', in 1956.\" The last time Lewis had had a song on the country charts was with \"Pen and Paper\" in 1964, which had reached number 36, but \"Another Place, Another Time\" would go all the way to number 4 and remain on the charts for 17 weeks.\n\nBetween 1968 and 1977, Lewis had 17 Top 10 hit singles on the Billboard country chart, including four chart-toppers. Hits include \"What's Made Milwaukee Famous (Has Made A Loser Out of Me)\", \"To Make Love Sweeter For You\", \"She Still Comes Around (To Love What's Left of Me)\", \"Since I Met You Baby\", \"Once More With Feeling\", \"One Has My Name (The Other Has My Heart)\", and \"Sometimes A Memory Ain't Enough\". The production on his early country albums, such as ''[[Another Place, Another Time (album)|Another Place, Another Time]]'' and ''She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye'', was sparse, quite different from the slick \"[[Nashville sound]]\" that was predominant on country radio at the time, and also expressed a full commitment by Lewis to a country audience. The songs still featured Lewis's inimitable piano flourishes, but critics were most taken aback by the rock and roll pioneer's effortlessly soulful vocals, which possessed an emotional resonance on par with the most respected country singers of the time, such as [[George Jones]] and [[Merle Haggard]]. In his book ''Jerry Lee Lewis: His Own Story'', biographer Rick Bragg notes that the songs Lewis was recording \"were of the kind they were starting to call 'hard country', not because it had a rock beat or crossed over into rock in a real way, but because it was more substantial than the cloying, overproduced mess out there on country radio\".\n\nIn a remarkable turnaround, Lewis became the most bankable country star in the world. He was so huge in 1970 that his former Smash producer [[Shelby Singleton]], who purchased [[Sun Records]] from [[Sam Phillips]] in July 1969, wasted no time in repackaging many of Lewis's old country recordings with such effectiveness that many fans assumed they were recent releases. One of his later unreleased Sun recordings, \"[[One Minute Past Eternity]]\", was issued as a single and soared to number 2 on the country chart, following Lewis's recent [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] hit \"She Even Woke Me Up To Say Goodbye\". Singleton would milk these unreleased recordings for years, following ''The Golden Cream of the Country'' with ''[[A Taste of Country]]'' later in 1970.\n\n===Grand Ole Opry appearance===\nLewis played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] only once, on January 20, 1973. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to ''A Half Century of Hits'', he had maintained an ambivalence to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Music City]] ever since he was turned away as an aspiring musician before his glory days at [[Sun Records]]: \"It was 18 years since he had left [[Nashville]] broke and disheartened...Lewis was never truly accepted in Nashville. He didn't move there and didn't [[schmooze]] there. He didn't fit in with the family values crowd. Lewis family values weren't necessarily worse, but they were different.\"<ref name=\"Escott\"/>\n\nAs recounted in a 2015 online ''Rolling Stone'' article by Beville Dunkerly, Lewis opened with his comeback single \"[[Another Place, Another Time (Del Reeves song)|Another Place, Another Time]]\". Ignoring his allotted time constraints\u2014and, thus, commercial breaks\u2014Lewis played for 40 minutes (the average Opry performance is two songs, for about eight minutes of stage time maximum) and invited [[Del Wood]]\u2014the one member of the Opry who had been kind to him when he had been there as a teenager\u2014out on stage to sing with him. He also blasted through \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Going On\", \"Workin' Man Blues\", \"Good Golly, Miss Molly\", and a number of other classics.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Dunkerly, Beville |date=January 20, 2015 |title=Flashback: Jerry Lee Lewis Drops an F-Bomb on the Grand Ole Opry |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |access-date=September 30, 2020 |magazine=Rolling Stone |archive-date=October 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021172629/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/flashback-jerry-lee-lewis-drops-an-f-bomb-on-the-grand-ole-opry-167176/ |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===''The Session'' and ''Southern Roots''===\n[[File:JerryLee Lewis 1977.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis performing in 1977]]\nLewis returned to the pop charts with \"[[Me and Bobby McGee]]\" in 1971 and \"[[Chantilly Lace (song)|Chantilly Lace]]\" in 1972, and this, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage [[rock and roll]], inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of British and Irish musicians, including [[Rory Gallagher]], [[Kenney Jones]], and Albert Lee. By all accounts the sessions were tense. The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut \"Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\" was the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the ''Billboard'' country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. ''The Session'' was his highest pop charting album since 1964's ''[[Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis]]'', hitting number 37. It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. Later that year, he went to Memphis and recorded ''[[Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis]]'', a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. According to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, \"the Killer\" was in a foul mood when he showed up at Trans Maximus Studios in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] to record: \"During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog.\" During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue ''Southern Roots: The Original Sessions'', Meaux asks Lewis, \"Do you wanna try one?\", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies, \"If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it.\"<ref>{{Cite web |last=Little |first=Michael H. |date=September 29, 2020 |title=Graded on a Curve: Jerry Lee Lewis, Southern Roots: Back Home to Memphis |url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |access-date=March 22, 2021 |website=The Vinyl District |archive-date=January 15, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210115110247/http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2020/09/graded-on-a-curve-jerry-lee-lewis-southern-roots-back-home-to-memphis-2/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. His last big hit with Mercury was \"Middle Age Crazy\", which made it to number 4 in 1977.\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Jerry Lee Lewis @ Credicard Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Lewis performing in 2009]]\nIn 1979, Lewis switched record labels to [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] and produced the critically acclaimed ''Jerry Lee Lewis'', although sales were disappointing. In 1986, Lewis was one of the inaugural inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Although looking frail after several hospitalizations due to stomach problems, Lewis was responsible for beginning an unplanned jam at the end of the evening, which was incorporated into all future events. That year, he returned to Sun Studio in Memphis to team up with Orbison, Cash, and Perkins along with longtime admirers like [[John Fogerty]] to create the album ''[[Class of '55]]''.\n\nIn 1989, a major motion picture based on his early life in rock and roll, ''[[Great Balls of Fire! (film)|Great Balls of Fire!]]'', brought him back into the public eye, especially when he decided to re-record all his songs for the movie soundtrack. The film was based on the book by Lewis's ex-wife, Myra Gale Lewis, and starred [[Dennis Quaid]] as Lewis, [[Winona Ryder]] as Myra, and [[Alec Baldwin]] as Jimmy Swaggart. The movie focuses on Lewis's early career and his relationship with Myra and ends with the scandal of the late 1950s. A year later, in 1990, Lewis made minor news when a new song he recorded called \"It Was the Whiskey Talkin' (Not Me)\" was included in the soundtrack to the hit movie ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]''. The song is also heard in the movie, playing on the radio. The public downfall of his cousin, [[televangelist]] [[Jimmy Swaggart]] around the same time, resulted in more adverse publicity to a troubled family. Swaggart is also a piano player, as is another cousin, country music star [[Mickey Gilley]]. All three listened to the same music in their youth and frequented Haney's Big House, the Ferriday club that featured black blues acts.

Lewis had a recorded argument with [[Sam Phillips]] during the recording session for \"[[Great Balls of Fire]]\", a song he initially refused to record because he considered it blasphemous (\"How can... How can the devil save souls? What are you ''talkin' about''?\" he asks Phillips during one heated exchange.) During the famous [[Million Dollar Quartet]] jam involving Lewis, Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, and Johnny Cash, they performed several gospel songs. Lewis's biographer [[Rick Bragg]] explains that part of the reason the recording only features Lewis and Elvis singing is because \"only Elvis and Jerry Lee [were] raised in the [[Assemblies of God|Assembly of God]]\", and {{\"'}}Johnny and Carl didn't really know the words... they was [[Baptists]]', [Lewis] said, and therefore deprived.\"<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bragg |first=Rick |author-link=Rick Bragg |date=October\u2013November 2014 |title=Jerry Lee and Me |url=http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |url-status=dead |journal=[[Garden & Gun]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121073447/http://www.gardenandgun.com/print/article/jerry-lee-and-me |archive-date=November 21, 2015 |access-date=October 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990 documentary ''The Jerry Lee Lewis Story'', Lewis said to the interviewer, \"The Bible doesn't even speak of religion.

I find myself falling short of the glory of God.\"\n\nGospel music was a staple of his performing repertoire.

Later that night, Lewis was at a [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] nightclub called the Vapors drinking champagne when he was given a gun. Lewis suddenly remembered that Elvis wanted to see him and, climbing aboard his new [[Lincoln Continental]] with the loaded pistol on the dash and a bottle of champagne under his arm, tore off for Graceland. Just before three o'clock in the morning, Lewis accidentally smashed into the famous Graceland gates.\n\nPresley's astonished cousin Harold Lloyd was manning the gate and watched Lewis attempt to hurl the champagne bottle out the car window, not realizing the window was rolled up, smashing both. Bragg reports that Lewis denies ever intending to do Presley harm, that the two were friends, but \"Elvis, watching on the [[closed-circuit television]], told guards to call the police. The [[Memphis police]] found the gun in the car and put Lewis, protesting, hollering, threatening them, away in handcuffs.\" Lewis said, \"The cops asked Elvis, 'What do you want us to do? And Elvis told 'em, 'Lock him up.' That hurt my feelings. To be scared of me \u2013 knowin' me the way he did \u2013 was ridiculous.\" Lewis was charged with carrying a pistol and public drunkenness. Released on a $250 bond, his defiant mugshot was wired around the world.

He has made numerous recordings, primarily in the [[rockabilly]] genre but also has a large body of recorded work in [[rock 'n' roll]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[rhythm & blues]], and [[country music]]. He performed live primarily in the [[Washington, D.C.]], area, but also played regularly at European roots music festivals.\n\n==Early life==\nHancock was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], and raised in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], where he has lived most of his life.  He attended George Washington High School in Alexandria, graduating in 1964. He came from a musical family. His maternal grandmother Katie sang with Minstrel shows in black face accompanying herself on piano and harmonica. Two of his aunts Eileen and Anita were a singing duo in the 1940s who sang at two or three Washington DC radios stations on a regular basis. His paternal grandfather Mitchell (Mitch) Hancock played mandolin from about 1897 until 1902. He often played on River Boats in New Orleans and recorded for the Edison Label. Billy's father worked for the Southern Railway and his mother worked for Waxie Maxie's, a local record store chain, and other record stores. The records his mother brought home from work, primarily rhythm and blues from the late 1940s, played a large and influential role in his musical development.\n\n==Career==\nHancock began his career playing in bands around Washington, D.C., while still a teenager. After graduating from high school, he played with bands in [[Rhode Island]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] before returning to the Washington area. In 1968, he moved to [[Baltimore]] to attend the [[Peabody Conservatory]], and continued to play in bands in the Baltimore area.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Hancock began a collaboration with [[Danny Gatton]] and they formed Danny and the Fat Boys with Hancock (bass, vocals), Gatton (guitars), and Dave Elliott (drums, vocals). In 1975, the group released ''American Music'' on a label owned by Hancock and his brother. The album's title was taken from a rhythm and blues song Hancock had written. It was later re-issued on CD.\n\nIn 1978, Hancock recorded four rockabilly songs under the name Billy Hancock and the Tennessee Rockets for [[Ripsaw Records]], a small independent label. He continued to record rockabilly for Ripsaw under that name for two years. Ripsaw released four singles during that time and licensed those and other titles to larger labels both in the U.S. and France. It is these rockabilly recordings for which Hancock is known internationally.\n\nIn 1983, Hancock recorded another rockabilly record, \"Hey! Little Rock And Roller\", that was released in France on the Big Beat Label. Later that year, he returned to Ripsaw to record various rock and roll songs, six of which Ripsaw released in 1985. All of the Ripsaw material was later released on CDs by Finnish Bluelight Records.\n\nThroughout his career, Hancock played in backing bands for prominent musicians, including [[Fats Domino]], [[Gene Vincent]], blues guitarist [[Roy Buchanan]], rockabilly [[Charlie Feathers]], [[the Clovers]], [[Amos Milburn]], and country musicians [[Dottie West]] and [[Jean Shepard]]. He co-produced and played guitar on [[Tex Rubinowitz]]'s rockabilly song \"Hot Rod Man.\"\n\nIn 2002, Hancock and his brother the television director, Dale Hancock founded Turkey Mountain Records, an independent record label. The label was formed to find and promote talented artists of all genres who, for whatever reasons, have been ignored by other record labels. Their Archival Series re-released material on artists of the past whose works have been unavailable until now. Turkey Mountain Records' roster of artists included: Danny Gatton, The British Walkers (featuring Roy Buchanan), Bobbie (The Kid) Howard with Link Wray and The Ray Men, Charlie Feathers, The Fallen Angels, and Billy Hancock himself.\n\nIn 2005, the [[Washington Area Music Association]] WAMA awarded Hancock a Special Recognition Award for his 40-plus years as a vocalist, musician, songwriter, producer, promoter, and label owner. In 2006, WAMA presented him with two \"Wammie\" awards for 2005 Roots Rock Vocalist and Roots Rock Recording.  In 2012, WAMA presented Hancock as one of \"The Fallen Angels\" a special recognition award.\n\nIn 2010, Hancock was inducted into the Southern Legends Hall of Fame. He is already a member of three other International Halls of Fame.\n\nHancock was also the television host for ''American Music'' in Arlington, Virginia, where he interviewed and showcased songwriters and a music historian.\n\nHe was also a member of the resurrected art rock group from the sixties, The Fallen Angels.\n\nOn 4 November 2012 Hancock was inducted into The Northern Virginia Blues Society, Blues Hall of Fame in Manassas, Va.\n\n==Discography==\n*1975 - ''American Music''\n*1981 - ''Rockabilly Fever''\n*1981 - ''Shakin' That Rockabilly Fever''\n*1983 - ''Hey!

His songs, such as \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\", \"[[Summertime Blues]]\", \"[[C'mon Everybody]]\" and \"[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]\", captured teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s and early 1960s.<ref name=\"RRHOF\">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Eddie Cochran: Hall of Fame Essay|work=Inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|location=Cleveland, Ohio|year=1987|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/eddie-cochran/|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Cochran experimented with [[multitrack recording]], distortion techniques, and [[overdubbing]], even on his earliest singles.<ref name=Cochran2003>{{cite book|last1=Cochran|first1=Bobby|author-link=Bobby Cochran|last2=Van Hecke|first2=Susan|title=Three Steps to Heaven: The Eddie Cochran Story|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|year=2003|isbn=978-0634032523}}</ref> Cochran played the guitar, piano, bass, and drums.<ref name=RRHOF/> His image as a sharply dressed and attractive young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the 1950s rocker, and in death, Cochran achieved iconic status.<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|title=Eddie Cochran Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|year=2020|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-cochran-mn0000793988/biography|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCochran was involved with music from an early age, playing in the school band and teaching himself to play blues guitar.<ref name=Cochran2003/> In 1955, Cochran formed a duo with the guitarist [[Hank Cochran]] (no relation) and became known as the Cochran Brothers. When they split the following year, Eddie began a song-writing career with [[Jerry Capehart]]. His first success came when he performed the song \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" in the film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'', starring [[Jayne Mansfield]]. Soon afterward, he signed a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] and his first record for the label, \"[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]\", rose to number 18 on the [[Billboard charts]].\n\nCochran died at the age of 21 in St Martin's Hospital, [[Bath, Somerset]], after a car accident in [[Chippenham]], [[Wiltshire]], at the end of his British tour with [[Gene Vincent]] in April 1960.  On April 16, after they had just performed at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]], on their way to their next venue, Vincent, Cochran and the songwriter [[Sharon Sheeley]] were involved in a high-speed traffic accident in a private-hire taxi. The other two passengers survived with major injuries, but Cochran, who had been thrown from the vehicle, suffered serious brain injuries and died the next day.\n\nThough Cochran's best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. His songs have been recorded by a wide variety of recording artists. [[Paul McCartney]] himself chose Cochran's \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" as his audition piece, assured to impress [[John Lennon]] by his performance of it, which he did and was hired as a member of Lennon's [[skiffle]] group [[The Quarrymen]], which later was renamed [[The Beatles]].\n\n==Early life==\nCochran was born on October 3, 1938, in [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]], to Alice and Frank R. Cochran. He was of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.<ref name=\"Cochran2003\" /> Cochran's parents were from Oklahoma. Cochran took music lessons in school but quit the band to play drums. Additionally, rather than taking piano lessons, he began learning guitar, playing country and other music he heard on the radio.\n\nIn 1952, Cochran's family moved to [[Bell Gardens, California]]. As his guitar playing improved, Cochran formed a band with two friends from his junior high school. In January 1955, Cochran dropped out of [[Bell Gardens High School]] in his first year to become a professional musician.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite web |year=2020 |title=Eddie Cochran Biography |url=https://www.gretschguitars.com/features/eddie-cochran |access-date=April 14, 2020 |work=Featured Pages |publisher=Gretsch Guitars |location=Savannah, Georgia}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n=== The Cochran Brothers (1955\u20131956) ===\n[[File:The Cochran Brothers.jpg|thumb|The Cochran Brothers]]\nDuring a show featuring many performers at an [[American Legion]] hall, Cochran met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter.

In the spring of 1956, [[Boris Petroff]] asked Cochran if he would appear in the musical comedy film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'' (1956). Cochran agreed and performed the song \"[[Twenty Flight Rock]]\" in the movie. In 1957, Cochran starred in his second film, ''[[Untamed Youth]]'' (1957), and had yet another hit, \"[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]\", one of the few songs he recorded that was written by other songwriters (in this case [[John D. Loudermilk]]). \"Twenty Flight Rock\" was written by AMI staff writer [[Ned Fairchild]] (a pen name\u2014her real name is Nelda Fairchild). Fairchild, who was not a rock and roll performer, merely provided the initial form of the song; the co-writing credit reflects Cochran's major changes and contributions to the final product.\n\n==== ''Singin' to My Baby'' (1957) ====\nIn the summer of 1957, [[Liberty Records]] issued Cochran's only studio album released during his lifetime, ''[[Singin' to My Baby]]''. The album included John D. Loudermilk's \"Sittin' in the Balcony\". For the album, Cochran worked with manager and songwriter [[Jerry Capehart]], and wrote the songs \"Completely Sweet\", \"Undying Love\", \"When I'm Mad\", and Cochran original \"One Kiss\".<ref>{{Cite web |date=1957 |title=Eddie Cochran With The Johnny Mann Orchestra And Chorus \u2013 Singin' To My Baby |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/290087-Eddie-Cochran-With-The-Johnny-Mann-Orchestra-And-Chorus-Singin-To-My-Baby |access-date=May 25, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref>\n\nIn 1958, Cochran seemed to find his stride in the famous teenage anthem \"[[Summertime Blues]]\" (co-written with Jerry Capehart). With this song, Cochran was established as one of the most important influences on rock and roll in the 1950s, both lyrically and musically. The song, released by [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] recording no. 55144, charted at number&nbsp;8 in 1958.\n\nOriginally, Cochran toured with [[The Kelly Four]] as his backing band, guitarist [[Mike Deasy]], saxophonist Mike Henderson, bassist [[Dave Shriver]], and drummer [[Gene Riggio]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Kelly Four Discography {{!}} Discogs |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2874069-The-Kelly-Four |access-date=May 27, 2024 |website=Discogs}}</ref> They were known as The Hollywood Swingers, a reference to [[Dick D'Agostin]]'s band. The line-up of Cochran's touring band would change overtime, with saxophonist [[Seals and Crofts|Jim Seals]] and bassist [[Connie 'Guybo' Smith]], and the addition of pianist [[Jim Stivers]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jimmy Seals session with Eddie Cochran |url=http://thompsonian.info/sealsec.html |access-date=2024-05-27 |website=thompsonian.info}}</ref> They were eventually joined by various members from Dick D'Agostin and The Swingers. In 1959, The Swingers line-up became [[Multi-instrumentalist|muti-instrumentalist]] with pianist Dick D'Agostin, pianist Jim Stivers (briefly on bass), guitarist [[Larry D'Agostin]], saxophonist [[Paul Kaufman]], and drummer Gene Riggio. However, D'Agostin left and was called-up to enlist into the U.S. Army. Members from The Kelly Four returned, Deasy and Henderson, with Stivers and Riggio being accompanied by bassist Don Meyer (later replaced by Dave Shriver). This was the last line-up of Cochran's touring band, returning to the name of The Kelly Four.<ref name=\":3\" /> [[File:C'mon, Everybody - Billboard ad 1958.jpg|thumb|''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' advertisement, December 15, 1958]]\n\nCochran starred in his last film ''[[Go, Johnny, Go!]]'' (1959).<ref>{{Cite AV media |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051665/ |title=Go, Johnny, Go!
