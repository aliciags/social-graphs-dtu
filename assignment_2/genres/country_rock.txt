At the age of six, he moved with his family to Virginia, where he grew up. At the age of eight, he began singing in church and learning to play piano by ear. While attending [[Fishburne Military School]], he began playing guitar and composing his own songs.<ref name=\"je\">{{cite web |last=Johnston |first=Donna |title=Jonathan Edwards Biography |publisher=Jonathan Edwards |url=http://www.jonathanedwards.net/general/presskit-biography.php |access-date=October 14, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104124900/http://www.jonathanedwards.net/general/presskit-biography.php |archive-date=November 4, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As a teenager he began performing in front of audiences.\n{{blockquote|I started on a $29 guitar and immediately started putting a band together, writing songs and learning all the contemporary folk songs of the time. I just loved it, loved everything about it, loved being in front of people playing music.<ref name=\"je\"/>}}\n\nWhile studying art at Ohio University, he became a fixture at local clubs, playing with a variety of rock, folk, and blues bands.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1967, he and his band moved to Boston and played clubs throughout New England. With [[Joe Dolce]] on lead guitar, they played cover tunes as well as their own country-blues originals under various names, including the Headstone Circus, St. James Doorknob, and the Finite Minds, and they made an album for [[Metromedia Records]] as Sugar Creek.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nIn the early 1970s, Edwards left the band and began performing as a solo acoustic artist. He would later recall:\n{{blockquote|I liked the sound of bronze strings on rosewood better than steel strings on magnets, and so I walked out of that club in Vermont, rented myself a van and PA system, and started traveling around the colleges in New England by myself, without gigs, just setting up in the lobbies of dormitories on a Saturday. Pretty soon I started getting a following.<ref name=\"je\"/>}}\n\nEdwards began opening for acts such as the [[Allman Brothers Band]] and [[B.B. King]]. He signed with [[Capricorn Records]] to record his first album, ''[[Jonathan Edwards (album)|Jonathan Edwards]]'' (1971).<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \n{{blockquote|We took about a year recording the first album\u2014different times, different studios, different sounds, different techniques. Recording was so new in '69 and '70. There was a song on the album called 'Please Find Me', and for some reason the engineer rolled over it. It got erased. We spent hours looking for it. We fired the engineer and put \"[[Sunshine (Jonathan Edwards song)|Sunshine]]\" in its place.<ref name=\"je\"/>}}\n\nLike most of the songs on ''Jonathan Edwards'', \"Sunshine\" was written shortly after Edwards left the band. \"I felt really fresh, really liberated,\" he later recalled. \"I just went out in the woods every day with my bottle of wine and guitar, sat by a lake near Boston and wrote down all those tunes, day after day.\" Regarding the theme of \"Sunshine\", Edwards commented, \"It was just at the time of the Vietnam War and Nixon. It was looking bad out there. That song meant a lot to a lot of people during that time\u2014especially me.\"<ref name=\"je\"/> \"Sunshine\" reached No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in January 1972.<ref name=\"golden-discs\">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/292 292] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/292 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the release of his debut album, Edwards moved out of the city to a farm in western Massachusetts, which provided the rural, country inspiration for his second album, ''Honky-Tonk Stardust Cowboy'' on the [[Atlantic Records]] label. This was an album of mostly self-penned acoustic, country-flavored songs about love and life and was closely followed by ''Have a Good Time For Me'', also on Atlantic.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nIn 1973 he and his friends got together to record a live album called ''Lucky Day'', named after a song he wrote in the truck on his way up to live in Nova Scotia. This \"fresh-air break\" lasted only a couple of months when his friend [[Emmylou Harris]] invited him to Los Angeles to sing backup on her album ''[[Elite Hotel]]''. That led to a deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and two albums produced by Harris' husband/producer [[Brian Ahern (producer)|Brian Ahern]]: ''Rockin' Chair'' and ''Sailboat''.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nIn 1979, Edwards moved back to the United States to New Hampshire, and then two years later back to Northern Virginia area where he had grown up. In 1983, he produced and recorded ''Blue Ridge'' with the bluegrass band, [[The Seldom Scene]], for [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]]. Then in 1987 he recorded a children's album, ''Little Hands'', which was released on the small independent American Melody label. It was selected by the [[American Library Association]] as a Notable Children's Recording.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nTurning to acting, Edwards toured as the lead in the Broadway musical ''[[Pump Boys and Dinettes]]''. When the show reached Nashville, he met an old friend from the folk circuit, Wendy Waldman.<ref name=\"Appleseed Edwards\">{{cite web |url=http://www.appleseedmusic.com/jonathanedwards/ |title=Jonathan Edwards |publisher=Appleseed Recordings |access-date=2018-04-13 |archive-date=March 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310084604/http://www.appleseedmusic.com/jonathanedwards/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> She and Mike Robertson convinced Edwards to come to town and record a country album. \"I've been making country-sounding records all my life, but never in Nashville. Yeah, let's do it.\" Edwards said. So, ''[[The Natural Thing (Jonathan Edwards album)|The Natural Thing]]'' was produced, recorded, and released on MCA/Curb Records in 1989. \"I was crazy about the songs we selected from those great Nashville writers, and the acoustic-based production that Wendy and I put together was just a joy to make and to listen to. I count that as one of the best albums I've ever been involved with.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/de/music/Jonathan+Edwards/+wiki|title=Alter, Heimatstadt, Biografie von Jonathan Edwards|website=Last.fm|language=de|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s, Edwards continued to tour, doing session work, and producing his own music as well as that of other talents, such as [[Cheryl Wheeler]] (\"Driving Home,\" \"Mrs. Pinocci's Guitar\"). He took part in the 1994 \"Back to the Future\" tour that also included [[Don McLean]], [[Tom Rush]], [[Jesse Colin Young]], [[Steve Forbert]] and [[Al Stewart]]. In 1994 he released ''One Day Closer'', his first solo album in five years, on his new record label, Rising Records. ''Man in the Moon'', which includes several of Edwards' original songs, followed the end of 1997. In September 1997, Rising Records released a remixed, re-sequenced ''Among Us'', a CD by [[Simon Townshend]], younger brother of the Who's [[Pete Townshend]]. Edwards also scored the soundtrack for ''The Mouse'', starring [[John Savage (actor)|John Savage]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/1996/film/reviews/the-mouse-1200447610/|title=The Mouse|last1=Harvey|first1=Dennis|date=1996-11-18|website=Variety|language=en|access-date=2019-02-05}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Michael Martin Murphey and Jonathan Edwards 2012.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Jonathan Edwards, Michael Martin Murphey, and Gary Roller at The Flying Monkey, Plymouth, New Hampshire, October 13, 2012]]\nIn 2001, Edwards celebrated 30 years of \"Sunshine\" with a First Annual Farewell Tour with [[Kenny White]] on piano. In the 2000s, Edwards narrated and performed in a travel series for Media Artists entitled ''Cruising America's Waterways'',<ref>[http://www.cruisingamerica.com] {{dead link|date=July 2024}}</ref> which was purchased by PBS. Media Artists also released a companion album. Edwards participated in a second series, which started running on PBS-TV stations in May 2004.\n\nIn 2008, Edwards appeared in the romantic comedy film ''[[The Golden Boys]]'', starring [[Bruce Dern]], [[David Carradine]], [[Charles Durning]], [[Mariel Hemingway]], and [[Rip Torn]]. Set in Cape Cod in 1905, the film featured Edwards in the role of Reverend Perley. In addition to acting, Edwards scored the film.<ref name=\"je\"/>\n\nIn the fall of 2012, he appeared with [[Michael Martin Murphey]] in a series of concerts throughout New England.

The song served as the lead-off single of her debut album, ''[[Here for the Party]]''. Wilson followed this album one year later with ''[[All Jacked Up]]'', the title track of which became the highest-debuting single for a female country artist upon its 2005 release. A third album, ''[[One of the Boys (Gretchen Wilson album)|One of the Boys]]'', was released in 2007.\n\nOverall, Wilson has charted 13 singles on the ''Billboard'' country charts, of which five have reached top ten: the number one \"Redneck Woman\", as well as \"[[Here for the Party (song)|Here for the Party]]\" (#3, 2004), \"When I Think About Cheatin'\" (#4, 2004), \"Homewrecker\" (#2, 2005), and \"[[All Jacked Up (song)|All Jacked Up]]\" (#8, 2005). The album ''Here for the Party'' was certified 5\u00d7 multi-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for sales of five million copies, while ''All Jacked Up'' was certified platinum.

Despite its high debut, however, \"All Jacked Up\" peaked at No.&nbsp;8 on Hot Country Songs after only eight chart weeks. It was also used, at one time, by [[ESPN]] as the opening theme for its baseball coverage.  Three more singles were released from ''All Jacked Up'': \"I Don't Feel Like Loving You Today\", \"Politically Uncorrect\" (a duet with [[Merle Haggard]]) and \"California Girls\", none of which reached Top 20 on the country charts. These latter two singles were issued on [[Columbia Records]], due to the closure of Epic Records's Nashville division.\n\nWilson's \"I Don't Feel Like Loving You Today\" was nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Female Country Vocal Performance, and Best Country Song.

After 10 weeks, it exited the Billboard Top 200, having sold 178,220 copies at that point. \"Come to Bed\" (a duet with John Rich) and the title track, the first two singles released, both peaked in the 30s on the country charts, while the third and final single (\"You Don't Have to Go Home\") failed to reach the Top 40.\n\n===''I Got Your Country Right Here''===\nOn July 14, 2008, Wilson released a new single, \"Don't Do Me No Good\".

Four years later, with $1,000 to his name, Rabbitt moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where he began his career as a songwriter.<ref>Wetmore, Elaine. \"Rabbitt's success long awaited,\" [[Penn State University]], September 28, 1981</ref> During his first night in the town, Rabbitt wrote \"Working My Way Up to the Bottom\", which [[Roy Drusky]] recorded in 1968.<ref name=\"spoke\">\"Eddie Rabbitt Made Breaks on His Own,\" ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'', February 5, 1977</ref> To support himself, Rabbitt worked as a [[truck driver]], [[soda jerk]], and fruit picker in Nashville.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rhino.com/article/stay-tuned-by-stan-cornyn-joe-smith-spreads-out |last=Cornyn |first=Stan |date=October 8, 2013 |title=Stay Tuned By Stan Cornyn: Joe Smith Spreads Out |work=[[Rhino Entertainment]] |access-date=February 4, 2021}}</ref> He was ultimately hired as a staff writer for the [[Hill & Range]] Publishing Company for $37.50 per week.<ref name=\"star\"/> As a young songwriter, Rabbitt socialized with other aspiring writers at Wally's Clubhouse, a Nashville bar; he said he and the other patrons had \"no place else to go.\"<ref>Hurst, Jack. \"Eddie Rabbitt's hit tells of unknown mountains,\" ''[[Wilmington Morning Star]]'', July 22, 1978</ref>\n\nRabbitt became successful as a songwriter in 1969, when [[Elvis Presley]] recorded his song \"[[Kentucky Rain]]\". The song went gold, and cast Rabbitt as one of Nashville's leading young songwriters. Presley also recorded Rabbitt's song \"[[Patch It Up]]\", which was featured in the concert film \"Elvis: That's the Way It Is\", and a lesser-known Rabbitt song called \"Inherit the Wind\" on the album ''Back in Memphis''. While eating [[Cap'n Crunch]],<ref name=\"milwaukee\">Legro, Ron. \"Two Country Charmers,\" ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]'', August 12, 1977</ref> he penned \"[[Pure Love (Ronnie Milsap song)|Pure Love]]\", which [[Ronnie Milsap]] rode to number one in 1974. This song led to a contract offer from [[Elektra Records]].\n\nRabbitt signed with Elektra Records in 1975. His first single under that label, \"[[You Get to Me]]\", made the top 40 that year; and two songs in 1975, \"[[Forgive and Forget (Eddie Rabbitt song)|Forgive and Forget]]\" and \"[[I Should Have Married You]]\", nearly made the top 10. These three songs, along with a recording of \"Pure Love\", were included on Rabbitt's 1975 [[Eddie Rabbitt (album)|self-named]] debut album. The year 1976 saw the release of his critically acclaimed album ''[[Rocky Mountain Music]]'', which included Rabbitt's first number-one country hit, \"[[Drinkin' My Baby (Off My Mind)]]\". In 1977, his third album, ''[[Rabbitt (album)|Rabbitt]]'', was released, and made the top five on the Country Albums chart. Also in 1977, the [[Academy of Country Music]] named Rabbitt \"Top New Male Vocalist of the Year\". By that time, Rabbitt had a good reputation in Nashville, and was being compared by critics to singer [[Kris Kristofferson]].<ref name=\"milwaukee\"/> That year, at [[Knott's Berry Farm]], Rabbitt appeared at the Academy of Country Music Awards and sang several of his songs from ''Rocky Mountain Music''. He won the Top New Male Vocalist of the Year award.\n\n===Crossover success===\nWhile still relatively unknown, Rabbitt toured with and opened for crossover star [[Kenny Rogers]], and also for [[Dolly Parton]] on a number of dates during her 1978 tour.<ref>Sutton, Lorna. \"Rogers provides memorable show,\" ''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'', July 20, 1978</ref> Following the 1978 release of ''Variations'', which included two more number-one hits, Rabbitt released his first compilation album, ''The Best of Eddie Rabbitt''. It produced Rabbitt's first crossover single, \"[[Every Which Way But Loose (song)|Every Which Way But Loose]]\", which topped country charts and reached the top 30 on both the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary, and was featured in the [[Every Which Way but Loose (film)|1978 Clint Eastwood movie of the same name]]. The song also broke the record for highest chart debut, entering at number 18. Rabbitt held this record alone until it was matched by [[Garth Brooks]]'s 2005 single \"[[Good Ride Cowboy]].\" The record was broken in 2006 upon the number-17 chart entrance of [[Keith Urban]]'s \"[[Once in a Lifetime (Keith Urban song)|Once in a Lifetime]].\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110607001200/http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1539069/keith-urban-single-makes-chart-history.jhtml Keith Urban Single Makes Chart History], [[Country Music Television|CMT]], August 21, 2006</ref> Rabbitt's next single, the [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]-flavored \"[[Suspicions (Eddie Rabbitt song)|Suspicions]]\" from his 1979 album ''[[Loveline (album)|Loveline]]'', was an even greater crossover success, reaching number one on Country charts, the top 15 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and number five on the Adult Contemporary charts.<ref>Roland, Tom [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r93645|pure_url=yes}} Loveline], [[Allmusic]]</ref> He was given his own television special on [[NBC]], first airing on July 10, 1980, which included appearances by such performers as [[Emmylou Harris]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]].<ref>\"Eddie Rabbitt Special,\" ''[[Kingman Daily Miner]]'', July 4, 1980</ref> By this point, Rabbitt had been compared to a \"young Elvis Presley\".<ref>Dudek, Duane. \"Miss Newton and Rabbitt wow all ages,\" ''[[Milwaukee Sentinel]]'', June 29, 1981</ref>\n\n[[File:Eddie Rabbitt & Crystal Gayle 1981-11-13 ticket.jpg|thumb|A ticket stub to an Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle joint performance in 1981]]\nRabbitt's next album, ''[[Horizon (Eddie Rabbitt album)|Horizon]]'', reached platinum status and contained the biggest crossover hits of his career, \"[[I Love a Rainy Night]]\" and \"[[Drivin' My Life Away]].\" Rabbitt developed \"Rainy Night\" from a song fragment he penned during a 1960s thunderstorm. \"Drivin'\" recalled Rabbitt's tenure as a truck driver, and was inspired by [[Bob Dylan]]'s song \"[[Subterranean Homesick Blues]]\".<ref name=\"obit\">{{cite news |last=Wadey |first=Paul |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-eddie-rabbitt-1158448.html |title=Obituary: Eddie Rabbitt |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=May 19, 1998}}</ref> His popularity was so great at this point that he was offered his own variety television show, which he respectfully declined, saying \"It's not worth the gamble.\"<ref>Nash, Alanna  [https://ew.com/article/1998/05/22/remembering-eddie-rabbitt/ The Urban Cowboy], [[Entertainment Weekly]]</ref>\n\nThe release of his 1981 ''[[Step by Step (Eddie Rabbitt album)|Step by Step]]'' album continued Rabbitt's crossover success as all three singles reached the top 10 on both Country and Adult Contemporary charts. The [[Step by Step (Eddie Rabbitt song)|title track]] became Rabbitt's third straight single to reach the top five on the Country, Adult Contemporary, and ''Billboard'' Hot 100 charts. The album ultimately reached gold status, Rabbitt's last album to do so. Rabbitt teamed up with another country pop crossover star, [[Crystal Gayle]], on \"[[You and I (Eddie Rabbitt & Crystal Gayle song)|You and I]]\", which was included on his 1982 album ''[[Radio Romance (album)|Radio Romance]]''. The duet reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Country chart and became a pop smash, peaking at number seven and number two, respectively, on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts. It was used as a love theme for a couple on the [[soap opera]] ''[[All My Children]]''.<ref name=\"obit\"/> The song \"You Put the Beat in My Heart\" from Rabbitt's second compilation, ''Greatest Hits - Volume II'' (1983), was his last crossover hit, reaching number 15 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\n===Late career===\nDuring the 1980s, Rabbitt moved further from crossover-styled music. His 1984 album ''[[The Best Year of My Life]]'' produced a number-one country hit and three more top-10 country hits, but none had crossover success. The illness and subsequent death of his son put his career on hold following the 1985 [[RCA Records]] release ''[[Rabbitt Trax]]'', which included the number one \"[[Friends and Lovers (Gloria Loring and Carl Anderson song)|Both to Each Other (Friends and Lovers)]]\", a duet with country pop star [[Juice Newton]]. Like \"You and I\", the song was used as the theme for a soap opera, ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''.<ref name=\"obit\"/>\n\nRabbitt returned from his hiatus in 1988 with the release of ''[[I Wanna Dance With You]]'', which despite somewhat negative reviews<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r93637|pure_url=yes}} \"I Wanna Dance With You\"], [[Allmusic]]</ref> produced two number-one songs, a cover of [[Dion DiMucci|Dion's]] \"[[The Wanderer (Dion song)|The Wanderer]]\" and the album's title track. Additionally, \"[[We Must Be Doin' Somethin' Right]]\" entered the top 10, although the album's final single \"[[That's Why I Fell in Love with You]]\" stalled at number 66. Rabbitt's [[Capitol Records]] album ''[[Jersey Boy]]'' was reviewed positively, as was its single \"[[On Second Thought (song)|On Second Thought]]\", Rabbitt's last number-one hit. The album also included \"[[American Boy (Eddie Rabbitt song)|American Boy]]\", a patriotic tune popular during the [[Gulf War]]<ref>Dillon, Charlotte  [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r93638|pure_url=yes}} \"Jersey Boy\"] [[Allmusic]]</ref> and used in [[Bob Dole]]'s 1996 presidential campaign.\n\nRabbitt was among the many country singers who suffered a dramatic decline in chart success beginning in 1991. That year, he released ''[[Ten Rounds (Eddie Rabbitt album)|Ten Rounds]]'', which produced the final charting single of his career, \"[[Hang Up the Phone]]\". Following that release, he left Capitol Records to tour with his band Hare Trigger.\n\nIn 1997, Rabbitt signed with [[Intersound Records]], but was soon diagnosed with [[lung cancer]]. After a round of [[chemotherapy]], he released the album ''[[Beatin' the Odds (Eddie Rabbitt album)|Beatin' the Odds]]''. In 1998, he released his last studio album, ''[[Songs from Rabbittland]]''.\n\n==Musical styles==\nRabbitt used innovative techniques to tie country music themes with light rhythm and blues-influenced tempos. His songs often used [[Reverberation|echo]], as Rabbitt routinely sang his own background vocals. In a process called the \"Eddie Rabbitt Chorale\", Rabbitt compensated for what ''Billboard Magazine'' described as a \"somewhat thin and reedy voice\" by recording songs in three-part harmonies.<ref name=\"billboard\"/> His music was compared to [[rockabilly]], particularly the album ''Horizon'', which was noted as having an Elvis-like sound. Rabbitt remarked that he liked \"a lot of the old Memphis sounds that came out of [[Sun Records]]\" during the 1950s, and that he \"wanted to catch the magic of a live band.\"<ref>Wetmore, Elaine ''Daily Collegian'', September 28, 1981</ref> He credited such wide-ranging artists as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Steely Dan]], Elvis Presley, and [[Willie Nelson]] with influencing his works.<ref name=\"billboard\"/> When putting together an album, Rabbitt tried to make sure he put in \"ten potential singles...no fillers, no junk.\" He remembered listening to albums as a child and hearing \"two hits and a bunch of garbage.\"<ref name=\"star\">Gardner, Tom  \"Eddie Rabbitt: Brooklyn boy makes his voice heard in Nashville,\" ''[[Wilmington Morning Star]]'', August 1, 1979</ref>\n\nRabbitt believed that country music was \"Irish music\" and that \"the minor chords in [his] music gave it that mystical feel.\"<ref name=\"people\">Allis, Tim and Bell, Bonnie [http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20120048,00.html Still Grieving After the Death of His Young Son, Eddie Rabbitt Finds Solace in Country Music], [[People Magazine]], April 17, 1989</ref>  Although he did not strive to produce pop music, his songs helped influence the direction of country music, leading to the Urban Cowboy era during the 1980s. Critic Harry Sumrall of the ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' said that Rabbitt was \"like a hot corn dog: nothing fancy, nothing frilly. You know what you're getting and you like it...never a country purist, Rabbitt nonetheless makes music that is plain and simple, with all of the virtues that make good country good.  [His songs] might be brisk, but they are also warm and familiar, like the breeze that wafts in over the fried artichokes.\"<ref>\"Likable Eddie Rabbitt is Right at Home at the Fair,\" ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'', August 11, 1986</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1990s, Rabbitt voiced criticism of [[hip hop music]], particularly [[Rapping|rap]], which he said was sending a negative message to youth. He stated that the music was \"inciting a generation\" and that it had helped to contribute to the high rates of teenaged pregnancy, high-school dropouts, and rapes during this period.<ref>Susman, Lori  \"Riverside Resort presents Eddie Rabbitt in concert\", ''[[Kingman Daily Miner]]'', April 23, 1993</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nWhen Rabbitt arrived in Nashville during the late 1960s, a friend gave him a pet chicken. Rabbitt said he had \"an affinity for animals\", and he kept the bird for a while before giving it to a farmer.<ref name=\"spoke\"/> During his Nashville days in the early 1970s, Rabbitt had a pet monkey, Jojo. Before his ''Rocky Mountain Music'' tour, the monkey bit Rabbitt, leaving his right arm in bandages.<ref>Beck, Marilyn. \"Dickinson-Bacharach split confuses friends,\" ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', September 20, 1976</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Rabbitt married Janine Girardi,<ref name=\"obit\"/><ref name=\"enc\">Johnson, Anne [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3492300059.html Rabbitt, Eddie] Contemporary Musicians, 1991</ref> whom he called \"a little thing about five feet tall, with long, black beautiful hair, and a real pretty face.\"<ref name=\"people\"/> He had previously written the songs \"Pure Love\" and \"Sweet Janine\" for her.<ref name=\"obit\"/> They had three children, Demelza,<ref name=\"enc\"/> Timmy, and Tommy. Timmy was diagnosed with [[biliary atresia]] upon birth. The condition required a [[liver transplant]] for survival and he underwent one in 1985, but the attempt failed and he died. Rabbitt temporarily put his career on hiatus, saying, \"I didn't want to be out of the music business, but where I was more important.\" Tommy was born in 1986.<ref name=\"obit\"/>\n\nRabbitt felt his responsibility as an entertainer was to be a good role model and he was an advocate for many charitable organizations, including the [[Special Olympics]], [[Easterseals (U.S.)|Easter Seals]], and the American Council on Transplantation, of which he served as honorary chairman. He also worked as a spokesman for the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] and [[United Cerebral Palsy]].<ref name=\"ny\"/>\n\nRabbitt was a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and let Bob Dole use his song \"American Boy\" during Dole's 1996 presidential campaign.<ref>\"INDECISION '96\", ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'', October 15, 1996</ref>\n\nRabbitt was also a fan of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and visited the set during the show's [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 5)|fifth season]] in 1991\u201392.<ref>''Star Trek: The Next Generation - 25th anniversary'' (2012).</ref>\n\n==Death==\nRabbitt died on May 7, 1998, in Nashville from [[lung cancer]] at the age of 56.

The band's members are Doug Phelps (bass guitar, vocals), Greg Martin (lead guitar, vocals), and brothers Richard Young (rhythm guitar, vocals) and Fred Young (drums, vocals). It was founded in 1968 as Itchy Brother, which consisted of the Young brothers and Martin, along with Anthony Kenney on bass guitar and vocals. Itchy Brother performed until 1982, with James Harrison replacing Martin from 1973 to 1976. The Youngs and Martin began performing as The Kentucky Headhunters in 1986, adding brothers Ricky Lee Phelps (lead vocals, harmonica) and Doug Phelps (bass guitar, vocals) to the membership.\n\nWith the release of its 1989 debut album ''[[Pickin' on Nashville]]'' via [[Mercury Records]], the band charted four consecutive Top 40 country singles. A second album for Mercury, ''[[Electric Barnyard]]'', did not do as well commercially, and the Phelps brothers left after its release to form [[Brother Phelps]]. Kenney re-joined and Mark S. Orr took over on lead vocals for 1993's ''[[Rave On!! (album)|Rave On!!]]'' and a [[compilation album]] entitled ''[[The Best of The Kentucky Headhunters: Still Pickin']]'' before the band exited Mercury. Orr left and Doug Phelps rejoined in 1996 as lead vocalist for the album ''[[Stompin' Grounds]]''. He also led on the [[Audium Entertainment]] albums ''[[Songs from the Grass String Ranch]]'' and ''[[Soul (The Kentucky Headhunters album)|Soul]]'', as well as ''[[Big Boss Man (The Kentucky Headhunters album)|Big Boss Man]]'' and a second compilation, ''[[Flying Under the Radar]]'', on CBuJ Entertainment. After Kenney's departure, Doug once again became the band's bass guitarist by the release of ''[[Dixie Lullabies]]'', in 2011.\n\nThe Kentucky Headhunters has released ten studio albums, three compilations, and twenty-three singles. Its highest-peaking single is a cover of the [[Don Gibson]] song \"[[Oh Lonesome Me]],\"  which the band took to number eight on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in 1990. In addition, the band has won three [[Country Music Association]] awards, an [[Academy of Country Music]] award, and a [[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]], won in 1990 for ''Pickin' on Nashville''.\n\n==History==\n\n===1968\u20131982: Early years as Itchy Brother===\nRichard Young, his younger brother Fred, and their cousins Anthony Kenney and Greg Martin began performing music in the Youngs' and Kenney's hometown of [[Glasgow, Kentucky]], in the 1960s.

He has released nine studio albums through [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]] since 2005.

His third No. 1 single was \"[[The Only Way I Know]]\", which he, [[Jason Aldean]], and [[Luke Bryan]] recorded for Aldean's album ''[[Night Train (Jason Aldean album)|Night Train]]''.\n\nA fourth album, ''[[The Outsiders (Eric Church album)|The Outsiders]]'', was released in February 2014. It produced five new singles between 2013 and 2015 with the [[The Outsiders (Eric Church song)|title track]], \"[[Give Me Back My Hometown]]\", \"[[Cold One]]\", \"[[Talladega (song)|Talladega]]\" and \"[[Like a Wrecking Ball]]\". \"Talladega\" and \"Give Me Back My Hometown\" each reached number one on the [[Country Airplay]] chart. Eric Church got his sixth No. 1 hit with [[Keith Urban]] in May 2015 with the single \"[[Raise 'Em Up]]\". His fifth studio album, ''[[Mr. Misunderstood]]'', was released in November 2015 and went on to produce two number one singles with \"[[Record Year]]\" and \"[[Round Here Buzz]]\".

In April 2021, Church released the [[triple album]] set ''[[Heart & Soul (Eric Church album)|Heart & Soul]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nChurch was born on May 3, 1977, in [[Granite Falls, North Carolina]] (Dudley Shoals area), to Ken and Rita Church. Church worked with his father at Clayton Marcus, a furniture upholstery company where his father was president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.furnituretoday.com/article/519425-pulaski-plans-eric-church-furniture-line|title=Pulaski plans Eric Church furniture line - Furniture Today|website=Furnituretoday.com|date=8 May 2015|access-date=5 October 2018}}</ref> At 13, he bought a guitar and began writing songs of his own. By his senior year of high school, he had found a gig at a local bar, which occupied most of his time. He played many [[Jimmy Buffett]] cover songs and a few of his own original songs in some dive bars. Some of these places were so rough that he got into a few altercations from the stage. For a few years, the band played often in bars and restaurants throughout North Carolina.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} The band \"Mountain Boys\" consisted of his college roommate, brother, and a fellow guitarist.<ref name=\"allmusic\" />\n\nBefore moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Eric graduated from [[South Caldwell High School]] and then [[Appalachian State University]] with a degree in [[marketing]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301808/eric-church/biography |title=Eric Church biography\n|magazine=Billboard\n|access-date=2016-07-17 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820212033/http://www.billboard.com/artist/301808/eric-church/biography |archive-date=2016-08-20 }}</ref> Upon graduation, Church became engaged to a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] teacher in the town of [[Lenoir, North Carolina]]. The future bride's father attempted to persuade Church into a corporate career, which he rejected as an aspiring musician (and later referenced in his song \"What I Almost Was\" from his debut album). She broke the engagement and he headed to Nashville with his father's financial backing. His father also provided the opportunity to make contacts, and more importantly, time to focus on developing his songwriting ability.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n==Music career==\n===2006\u20132010: ''Sinners Like Me'' and ''Carolina''===\nChurch co-wrote [[Terri Clark]]'s 2005 single \"The World Needs a Drink\",<ref name=\"allmusic\" /> and the track \"Whiskey Wings\" on [[Dean Miller]]'s 2005 album ''[[Platinum (Dean Miller album)|Platinum]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/platinum-mw0000208385|title=''Platinum'' review|last=Deming|first=Mark|work=Allmusic|access-date=29 August 2012}}</ref> He started recording with different producers.

An additional track from the album, \"Lightning\", was made into a [[music video]] despite not being released as a single. Church wrote the song shortly after moving to Nashville, inspired by the movie ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]''.<ref name=\"cmtsinners\" /> Following the album's success, Church toured with [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Rascal Flatts]].<ref name=\"cmtsinners\" /> Church was fired from opening for Rascal Flatts after repeatedly performing for longer than his allotted time, despite repeated warnings. He was replaced by Taylor Swift, who was just starting her career. Before Swift started the tour, Church and Swift spoke, where he told Swift that she would thrive on the tour and joked that she should give him her first gold record as a thanks. Swift later did give him her first gold record with an attached note that said \"Thanks for playing too long and too loud on the Flatts tour. I sincerely appreciate it.

He was previously a turntablist for [[Kid Rock]]'s backing group [[Twisted Brown Trucker]]; since 1999, he has recorded as a solo artist. His singles \"[[Follow Me (Uncle Kracker song)|Follow Me]]\" and \"[[Drift Away#Uncle Kracker featuring Dobie Gray version|Drift Away]]\" were top 10 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\n== Early life ==\nShafer was born in [[Mount Clemens, Michigan]], on June 6, 1974.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/uncle-kracker-mn0000219428|title=Uncle Kracker biography|last=Wilson|first=Mackenzie|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=June 25, 2013}}</ref> With his brother Mike Shafer, he visited a [[nightclub]] in [[Clawson, Michigan]], where a [[turntablist|turntables]] competition was occurring. His older brother was competing against a then-unknown musician, Kid Rock. Shafer soon became friends with [[Kid Rock]]. In those times, he was mainly [[rap]]ping. He went to [[L'Anse Creuse High School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12064066|title=Uncle Kracker On Eminem/ICP Gun Incident|publisher=YAHOO!|access-date=June 17, 2008}}</ref> In 1994, Kid Rock asked Shafer to play turntables for his band called Twisted Brown Trucker. Shafer knew nothing of using turntables, but since his brother was an experienced DJ, he agreed. He only performed at live shows at the time, until he began recording for Rock's album, ''[[Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp]]''; Shafer was a featured vocalist on some of the tracks. He then began working on a [[solo album]], but he continued being the DJ for Kid Rock. Upon the release of Rock's multi-platinum album, ''[[The History of Rock]]'', Shafer decided that it was time to release his first solo album, ''[[Double Wide (Uncle Kracker album)|Double Wide]],'' in 2000.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== ''Double Wide'' ===\n''Double Wide'' was Uncle Kracker's first solo album. Released on June 30, 2000, it peaked at Number 7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart and is Shafer's most successful and highest-selling album. The album was produced by [[Kid Rock]], with mixing additional production by [[Michael Bradford]]. The first single taken off the album was \"[[Follow Me (Uncle Kracker song)|Follow Me]]\", which was co-written with Bradford, and peaked at Number 5 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in June 2001. The album spent the next 10 months on the Billboard 200, and \"Follow Me\" also had a long chart run. His second single, \"Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\", failed to hit the Hot 100 chart; however, the song has been released one year earlier in the soundtrack of ''[[Shanghai Noon]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Shanghai Noon \u2013 Cast {{!}} IMDbPro|url=https://pro.imdb.com/title/tt0184894/|access-date=September 7, 2020|website=pro.imdb.com}}</ref> ''Double Wide'' was certified 2\u00d7 Multi-Platinum on November 29, 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Uncle%20Kracker&title=Double%20Wide&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50|title=RIAA \u2013 Gold & Platinum \u2013 November 21, 2010: ''Double Wide'' certified awards|publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|access-date=November 21, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== ''No Stranger to Shame'' ===\nAfter a great deal of touring to promote the first album, he began to work on a follow-up album. Entitled ''[[No Stranger to Shame]]'', it was released on August 27, 2002. The album reached No.&nbsp;43 on the Billboard albums chart. A hit single was released, a cover version of [[Dobie Gray]]'s 1973 Top 5 hit, \"[[Drift Away]]\" \u2013 also including Gray as a guest vocalist. Kracker's version of this song peaked at No.&nbsp;9 on the [[Hot 100]] one week to the day after Gray's 63rd birthday, and it set a record for most weeks at No.&nbsp;1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, remaining atop this chart for 28 nonconsecutive weeks. Other singles released from ''No Stranger to Shame'' include \"In A Little While\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;59 on the Hot 100 and No.&nbsp;26 on the Adult Contemporary charts. A third single was released, \"Memphis Soul Song\", which charted on the [[Adult Top 40]] at No.&nbsp;35. A special remix of \"Memphis Soul Song\" was also released, featuring harmonies by legendary singing group [[The Jordanaires]], who had famously sung harmonies with [[Elvis Presley]]. The album was certified gold by the [[RIAA]] within a year of its release. Soon after this period, Kracker became good friends with country music star [[Kenny Chesney]] and the two began a successful touring partnership together, brought on by the success of Kenny's hit single \"[[When the Sun Goes Down (Kenny Chesney song)|When the Sun Goes Down]]\", featuring Uncle Kracker both on the single, and prominently in the video.\n\n=== ''Seventy Two and Sunny'' ===\nAfter touring, Shafer began working on a third album which he called ''[[Seventy Two and Sunny]]''. It was his first not to feature a [[parental advisory]] label as well as the first one to not feature any [[hip-hop]] songs, and moved onto a pure country sound. The album featured two singles: \"Rescue\", which only charted at No.&nbsp;20 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary singles chart but did not chart on any other charts, and \"Writing It Down,\" which did not chart at all. Shafer did have some success that year though when he was featured on Chesney's track, \"[[When the Sun Goes Down (Kenny Chesney and Uncle Kracker song)|When the Sun Goes Down]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, and went on to achieve Gold status. ''Seventy Two and Sunny'' has sold about 200,000 copies. It peaked at No.&nbsp;39 on the Billboard 200.\n\n=== ''Happy Hour'' ===\nUncle Kracker's fourth studio album is entitled ''[[Happy Hour (Uncle Kracker album)|Happy Hour]]''.<ref name=\"HappyHourAlbumDelay\">{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/uncle-kracker/news/uncle-kracker-quotfrustratedquot-by-album-delay--51638611|title=Uncle Kracker \"frustrated\" by album delay|publisher=Yahoo! Music News|access-date=May 11, 2009}}</ref> The album was in the works for five years and was delayed due to [[Atlantic Records]]' decision to bring in [[Rob Cavallo]] to produce the album right as they were finishing their cut of the album in late 2007. An early promo version of the album contained the tracks \"Happy Hour\", \"Vegas Baby\", \"I'm Not Leaving\", \"The One That Got Away\", and \"That's What's Happenin\". \"[[Smile (Uncle Kracker song)|Smile]],\" the first single from the album, was released on July 13, 2009, and has peaked at No.&nbsp;31 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The album was released on September 15, 2009. \"Smile\" also became his first solo entry on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, where it debuted at No.&nbsp;57 for the week of November 7, 2009, and peaked at No.&nbsp;6 in September 2010. A music video for the track \"My Girlfriend\" was released in November 2009, though there has been no official word whether it will be serviced as the album's second single. The album also features country singer [[Jesse Lee (singer)|Jesse Lee]] (also on Atlantic Records) in a duet they wrote called \"Me Again.\"\n\n==== ''Happy Hour: The South River Road Sessions'' ====\nA six-song EP, ''[[Happy Hour: The South River Road Sessions]]'', was released on June 22, 2010. The EP features country remakes of songs off the ''Happy Hour'' album. The singles released were a remake of \"Smile\" and \"[[Good to Be Me]]\", featuring Kid Rock.\n\n=== ''Midnight Special'' ===\n[[File:Uncle kracker.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Uncle Kracker performing in 2012]]\nOn November 16, 2012, Uncle Kracker released his fifth studio album, ''[[Midnight Special (Uncle Kracker album)|Midnight Special]]'', produced by [[Keith Stegall]]. [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]] and [[Vanguard Records]] released the album under parent company [[Welk Music Group]]. The album was a full-fledged country record. The first single to come off of the album was \"Nobody's Sad on a Saturday Night\", followed by \"Blue Skies\". Shafer performed songs from the album while on the road with Kid Rock for his $20 Best Night Ever Tour during 2013.\n\n=== New singles and ''Coffee & Beer'' (2018\u2013present) ===\nOn August 10, 2018, Kracker released his new single entitled \"Floatin'\", along with an accompanying music video.<ref>{{Citation |title=Uncle Kracker - Floatin' [Official Video] | date=August 10, 2018 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvEvbUsS1Nw |access-date=2023-10-26 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn May 4, 2020, \"No Time to Be Sober\" premiered with a simple lockdown music video.<ref>{{Citation |title=Uncle Kracker - No Time to Be Sober [Official Video] | date=May 4, 2020 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAvvup8Jf0E |access-date=2023-10-26 |language=en}}</ref> On December 21, 2020, \"Silver Bells\" released for Christmas.<ref>{{Citation |title=Uncle Kracker - Silver Bells | date=December 21, 2020 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2naN7iFdTa0 |access-date=2023-10-26 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn June 9, 2023, Uncle Kracker released the single \"Sweet 16\".<ref>{{Citation |title=Sweet 16 | date=June 8, 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mo3_YJPUDqg&list=OLAK5uy_mZRUANEXFbPT47far85pfC5Na-ZadKpwc |access-date=2023-10-26 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn July 20, 2023, \"Reason to Drink\" was released.<ref>{{Citation |title=Reason To Drink | date=July 20, 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3lUA4DGQOA&list=OLAK5uy_m7oTorh9yOaBVFDZ3T32wZ9W3VS_m8Lh8 |access-date=2023-10-26 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nUncle Kracker toured with [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] and [[ZZ Top]] on their Sharp Dressed Simple Man Tour, which commenced on July 21, 2023 in [[West Palm Beach]] and concluded on September 17 in [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Uncle Kracker - Drift Away - Live - Sharp Dressed Simple Man Tour - 8/11/23 | date=August 12, 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3Kq9ldfcJc |access-date=2023-10-26 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn October 19, 2023, \"Cruising Altitude\" released after the finished tour.<ref>{{Citation |title=Cruising Altitude | date=October 19, 2023 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qxqw-ShjxSA&list=OLAK5uy_lAZdY4V3HKsDufrwZ-lVe98OMhs8e7JJ0 |access-date=2023-10-26 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n\"Beach Chair,\" Uncle's latest single with accompanying video directed by The Manning Brothers, was released on May 31, 2024.\n\nOn July 12, 2024, Uncle Kracker released his first album in a decade entitled ''Coffee & Beer''<ref>{{cite web | url=https://musicrow.com/2024/07/uncle-kracker-offers-a-needed-escape-on-new-lp-coffee-beer/ | title=Uncle Kracker Offers a Needed Escape on New LP 'Coffee & Beer' | date=July 12, 2024 }}</ref>.\n\n== Personal life ==\nShafer was married to Melanie Haas from 1998 to 2014.

Among their well-known songs are \"[[Danny's Song]]\", \"[[House at Pooh Corner (song)|House at Pooh Corner]]\", and \"[[Your Mama Don't Dance]]\". After selling more than 16 million records and becoming one of the leading musical duos of the 1970s,<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\">\"Together again: Kenny Loggins and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] bring their hits to Biloxi,\" by Ron Thibodeaux, The Times-Picayune (New Orleans), July 29, 2005.</ref> Loggins and Messina separated in 1976. Although Messina would find only limited popularity following the breakup, Loggins went on to achieve major chart success in the 1980s. In 2005 and again in 2009, Loggins and Messina reformed for tours in the United States.\n\n==History==\n===Initial career 1971\u20131976===\n[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], formerly of [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Poco (band)|Poco]], was working as an independent record producer for [[Columbia Records]] in 1970 when he met [[Kenny Loggins]], a little-known singer/songwriter and guitarist who was signed to [[ABC-Dunhill]] as a staff songwriter.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor-first=Colin|editor-last=Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=766}}</ref>\n\nThe two recorded a number of Loggins' compositions in Messina's home living room. When Columbia signed Loggins to a six-album contract (with the assistance of Messina), recording began in earnest for Loggins' debut album, with Messina as producer. Messina originally intended to lend his name to the Loggins project only to help introduce the unknown Loggins to Messina's well-established Buffalo Springfield and Poco audiences. However, by the time the album was completed, Messina had contributed so much to the album \u2013 in terms of songwriting, arrangement, instrumentation, and vocals \u2013 that an \"accidental\" duo was born.\n\nTheir debut album was released November 1971 as ''Kenny Loggins with Jim Messina [[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Sittin' In]]''. The album's first single release, the Caribbean-flavored \"[[Vahevala]]\" (or \"Vahevella\" or \"Vaheevella\"), found top 3 success on Chicago's [[WCFL (AM)|WCFL]] on May 18, 1972.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldiesloon.com/ilc/wcfl051872.htm|title=WCFL - all hit music in the Midwest|publisher=Oldiesloon.com|date=May 18, 1972|access-date=January 5, 2013}}</ref> \"Vahevala\" and \"Nobody But You\" both reached the [[Hot 100]]. Although at first the album went unnoticed by radio upon release, it eventually gained traction by autumn 1972, particularly on college campuses, where the pair toured heavily. Loggins' and Messina's harmonies meshed so well that what was begun as a one-off album became an entity unto itself. Audiences regarded the pair as a genuine duo rather than as a solo act with a well-known producer. Instead of just continuing to produce Loggins as a sole performer, they decided to record as a duo: Loggins and Messina.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nOn March 3, 1973, Loggins and Messina played Carnegie Hall. Ian Dove in the ''New York Times'' called it a \"near-perfect rock 'n' roll concert\".<ref>{{Cite news|date=March 3, 1973|title=LOGGINS AND MESSINA PLAY CARNEGIE ROCK (Published 1973)|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/03/03/archives/loggins-and-messina-play-carnegie-rock.html|access-date=March 13, 2021|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n\"When our first album, ''[[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Sittin' In]]'', came out, we started receiving a lot of excitement about the music and good sales,\" Messina recalled in 2005. \"We had a choice. It was either I now go on and continue to produce him and we do the solo career or we stay together and let this work. For me, I did not desire to go back out on the road. I had had enough of that, and I wanted to produce records. But [[Clive Davis]] (then president of the record company) intervened and said, 'You know, I think you'd be making a mistake if you guys didn't take this opportunity. Things like this only happen once in a lifetime. It may merit you sleeping on it overnight and making a decision that will be in your best interest.' He was absolutely correct. Kenny made the decision as well. It delayed his solo career, but it gave him an opportunity, I think, to have one.\"<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" />\n\nMessina assembled The Kenny Loggins Band by summoning old friends, bassist Larry Sims and drummer Merel Bregante, formerly of [[The Sunshine Company]], multireedist [[Jon Clarke (musician)|Jon Clarke]], and violinist/multireedist Al Garth. Famed [[Grammy]]-winning keyboardist, songwriter and record producer [[Michael Omartian]] played keyboards on the [[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|debut]], [[Loggins and Messina (album)|second]] and [[Full Sail (Loggins and Messina album)|third]] albums, but did not join them on tour. Los Angeles\u2013based session percussionist [[Milt Holland]] played on all of the duo's studio albums, but like Omartian, he did not tour with them.<ref>{{cite web|last=Flans |first=Robyn |url=http://www.mixonline.com/news/profiles/classic-tracks-loggins-messinas-vahevala/375146 |title=Classic Tracks: Loggins & Messina's 'Vahevala' |publisher=Mixonline |date=September 1, 2004 |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOver the next four years, from 1972 to 1976, they produced four more studio albums of original material, plus one album of [[Cover version|covers]] of other artists' material (''[[So Fine (Loggins and Messina album)|So Fine]]''), and two live albums. They sold 16 million records and were the most successful duo of the early 1970s, surpassed later in the decade only by [[Hall & Oates]].<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" /> They charted three top 20 singles from the second and third albums: \"[[Your Mama Don't Dance]]\" (No. 4), \"[[Thinking of You (Loggins and Messina song)|Thinking of You]]\" (No. 18), and \"[[My Music (song)|My Music]]\" (No. 16). Their work was covered by other prominent artists, including [[Lynn Anderson]], who recorded \"[[Listen to a Country Song (song)|Listen to a Country Song]]\" in 1972 and reached No. 3 on the charts, and [[Anne Murray]], who reached the U.S. top ten with \"[[Danny's Song]]\" in early 1973 and the U.S. top twenty with \"[[A Love Song (Loggins and Messina song)|A Love Song]]\" in early 1974. The later studio albums, ''[[Mother Lode (album)|Mother Lode]]'' (1974), ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]'' (1976), often found both Loggins and Messina more as two solo artists sharing the same record rather than as a genuine partnership. As both Loggins and Messina noted in 2005, their collaboration eventually became more a competition.\n\nNever really a team of true equals because of the initial teacher\u2013apprentice nature of their music experience levels, the pair had quietly, amicably parted in 1976. Their final studio album of original material, ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]'', was released January 1976. Later that year the duo went on a final tour, <ref name=\"Larkin\"/> though prior to the start of the tour, Loggins accidentally cut his hand with a [[craft knife]] while practicing his wood-carving hobby at home which required surgery, thereby preventing him from playing guitar for most of that final tour. The final two concert dates of Loggins & Messina - as a duo - were in [[Honolulu]], Hawaii, at the [[Neil S. Blaisdell Center]], on September 24 and 25, 1976, upon which the duo then parted to embark on solo careers. Messina found solo success elusive, but Loggins went on to become one of the biggest hitmakers of the 1980s.\n\nA greatest-hits album, ''[[The Best of Friends (album)|The Best of Friends]]'', was released in November 1976, two months after the duo had ended.  In January 1977, a second live album (from concerts in 1975 and 1976), ''[[Finale (album)|Finale]]'', was released, more by record company decision than one intended by the artists.\n\n===Reformation===\nThe two reunited in 2005 to choose tracks for an expanded compilation album of singles and album cuts ''[[The Best: Sittin' In Again]]'', which proved successful enough for them to embark on tour together. Their successful \"Sittin' In Again\" tour was launched in mid-2005 and played-out the remainder of the year. They also released an album that year of the tour. \"Every couple of years we'd talk about it, but I was having too much fun as a solo artist,\" Loggins said that summer. \"It was very rewarding for me, and I wasn't ready to share the reins. I still had a lot of stuff to do on my own, to prove myself and to express myself, in a way that wouldn't have fit in with Loggins and Messina.\"<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" />\n\nThe two were pleased enough to consider future Loggins and Messina projects and the two also toured in 2009. \"Like most relationships, we were a moment in time,\" Loggins said. \"It's just really fun to be able to go back and celebrate that and just sort of really honor each other as grown men, in a way we never really did back then. We were young and competitive and didn't realize that it wasn't necessarily all about getting your way, but you learn that if you grow up.\"<ref name=\"Thibodeaux\" />\n\nTheir backing band changed from album to album, with the core members listed below. Some albums featured backing members who later were well-known in their own right; [[John Townsend (artist)|John Townsend]] and [[Ed Sanford]], later of the [[Sanford-Townsend Band]] (\"[[Smoke from a Distant Fire]]\"), contributed vocals and songwriting to the ''Native Sons'', their final studio album.\n\n==Members==\n*[[Kenny Loggins]] &ndash; vocals, rhythm guitar, acoustic guitar, harmonica \n*[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] &ndash; vocals, lead guitar, acoustic guitar, [[mandolin]], [[Dobro]]\n\n;Supporting personnel\n*Al Garth &ndash; tenor saxophone, bass clarinet, alto saxophone, violin, [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], viola, percussion, [[steel drum]] and backing vocals\n*Jon Clarke \u2013 [[baritone saxophone]], [[English horn]], flute, tenor saxophone, soprano saxophone, bass saxophone, bass clarinet, [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], bass flute, oboe, [[steel drum]] and percussion (died in 2005)\n*Larry Sims \u2013 bass and backing vocals (died in 2014)\n*Merel Bregante \u2013 drums, percussion, [[timbales]] and backing vocals\n*[[Milt Holland]] \u2013 percussion (died in 2005)\n*[[Michael Omartian]] \u2013 keyboards, percussion and [[concertina]]\n*Vince Denham \u2013 flute, bass clarinet, alto, soprano and tenor saxophone\n*Don Roberts \u2013 clarinet, alto flute, alto, baritone, soprano and tenor saxophone\n*Steve Forman \u2013 percussion, [[vibraphone|vibes]]\n*[[David Paich]] \u2013 keyboards\n*Dave Wallace \u2013 synthesizer\n*Chris Brooks \u2013 [[koto (instrument)|koto]]\n*[[Michel Rubini]] \u2013 keyboards\n*Richard Greene &ndash; violin, mandolin, [[mandocello]]\n*[[Rusty Young (musician)|Rusty Young]] \u2013 Dobro (died in 2021)\n*Vince Charles \u2013 steel drums (died in 2001)\n*[[Victor Feldman]] \u2013 percussion (died in 1987)\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| [[Music recording sales certification|Certifications]]\n|-\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| <small>[[Billboard 200|US]]</small><br><ref name=\"Awards\">{{cite web|title=Loggins & Messina - Awards|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/loggins-messina-mn0000277351/awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=September 8, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410062403/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/loggins-messina-mn0000277351/awards|archive-date=April 10, 2013}}</ref>\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| <small>[[Kent Music Report|AUS]]</small><br><ref name=aus>{{cite book|last=Kent|first=David|author-link=David Kent (historian)|title=Australian Chart Book 1970\u20131992|edition=illustrated|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=St Ives, N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|page=180}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1971\n| ''[[Sittin' In (Loggins and Messina album)|Sittin' In]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 70\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014\n| \n* US: Platinum\n|-\n| 1972\n| ''[[Loggins and Messina (album)|Loggins and Messina]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 16\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 61\n| \n* US: Platinum\n|-\n| 1973\n| ''[[Full Sail (Loggins and Messina album)|Full Sail]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 10\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014\n| \n* US: Platinum\n|-\n| 1974\n| ''[[Mother Lode (album)|Mother Lode]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 8\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 89\n|\n* US: Gold\n|-\n| 1975\n| ''[[So Fine (Loggins and Messina album)|So Fine]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 21\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 83\n| \n|-\n| 1976\n| ''[[Native Sons (Loggins and Messina album)|Native Sons]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 16\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014\n| \n* US: Gold\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:9pt;\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart.\n|}\n\n===Live albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\"| Peak chart positions\n! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications\n|-\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| <small>[[Billboard 200|US]]</small><br><ref name=\"Awards\"/>\n! style=\"width:40px;\"| <small>[[Kent Music Report|AUS]]</small><br><ref name=aus/>\n|-\n| 1974\n| ''[[On Stage (Loggins and Messina album)|On Stage]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 5\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 97\n| \n* US: Platinum\n|-\n| 1977\n| ''[[Finale (album)|Finale]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| 83\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014\n|\n|-\n| 2005\n| ''[[Live: Sittin' In Again at the Santa Barbara Bowl]]''\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| \u2014\n|\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:9pt;\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart.\n|}\n\n===Compilation albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Through his father's side, he is part of the [[Lee family]] of Virginia ([[Henry Lee II]] and [[Richard Henry Lee]] were two of his 4th-great-grandfathers).  He graduated from Christian Brothers High School in Memphis in 1962 as a merit finalist, a National Honor Society member and the salutatorian of his class.

During the introduction of his set, his boot got caught between a hydraulic lift and the lip of the stage surface, which crushed his foot causing a severe [[hematoma]] in the ankle; most of the damage was centering within his toes. It took about 30&nbsp;seconds for Chesney to pry his foot loose as he squatted down on the stage while the band continued to play an extended introduction of the song. When Chesney finally freed himself, he stood up and held his hand on his knee as he began singing. Chesney did not acknowledge the injury during the early part of his performance. However, he was visibly limping and seemed to rest near a drum riser while leaning over and holding his knee during the instrumental breaks of his songs. As he came offstage, a doctor from the [[University of South Carolina]] cut off Chesney's cowboy boot and immediately began treating the foot injury. X-rays that were taken afterwards revealed several crushed bones in his right foot.

They have also 16 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] or Country Airplay chart, of which 13 have reached number 1. Their first album, ''[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]'', is certified triple-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], while its follow-ups, ''[[You Get What You Give (album)|You Get What You Give]]'' and ''[[Uncaged]]'', are certified platinum. Artists with whom they have collaborated include [[Alan Jackson]], [[Angie Aparo]], [[Jimmy Buffett]], [[Kid Rock]], [[Jason Mraz]], [[Dave Grohl]], [[Chris Cornell]], [[Brandi Carlile]], [[Avicii]], [[Los Lonely Boys]], [[Sara Bareilles|Sara Barellies]] and [[John Fogerty]] of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2015}}\nIn 2002, Brown was traveling with a heavy tour schedule of approximately 200 dates a year. The initial Zac Brown Band lineup consisted of Brown, on acoustic guitar and lead vocals, backed by drummer Marcus Petruska and bass guitarist Jacob Lawson. In 2003, Brown started his own label, called Home Grown\u2014it was later renamed \"Southern Ground\".\n\nIn 2004, Brown opened a music club and restaurant with his father in the Lake Oconee area of Georgia, called \"Zac's Place\" where the fare was southern-style cooking. A developer bought the restaurant and, in turn, the Zac Brown Band bought a tour bus and began touring full-time, playing rock and country clubs, as well as folk and jam band festivals. The release of the Zac Brown Band's first independent album, ''Home Grown'', occurred during the same year.\n\nAlso in 2004, Brown added violinist/fiddler and tenor vocalist Jimmy De Martini to the lineup. According to an interview with De Martini, he explained that Wyatt Durrette, Brown's frequent songwriting collaborator, was working as a bartender at Sidelines Sports Bar in [[Kennesaw, Georgia]], at the time, where the Zac Brown Band frequently performed. Durette suggested De Martini to Brown, who was wanting a \"lead instrument\" in his band, as well as a harmony singer. After doing several performances with the band at the club, Brown asked De Martini to become a permanent member, to which De Martini gladly obliged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://greenville.metromix.com/music/article/q-and-a-jimmy/1470971/content|title=Q&A: Jimmy DeMartini of Zac Brown Band|author=Matt Wake|publisher=Metromix Greenville|date=September 17, 2009|access-date=November 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBrown met [[John Driskell Hopkins]] in 1998 when Hopkins was hosting an open mic night at CJ's Landing in Buckhead, Georgia. Hopkins later recorded ''Home Grown'' in his music studio, Brighter Shade Studios. The two remained friends, and in 2005, Hopkins stepped in as bass guitarist while helping the group finish what became their number-one single \"Toes\". \"Toes\" was the second single from the band's major-label debut, ''[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]'', which was partially recorded in Hopkins' studio. ''[[You Get What You Give (album)|You Get What You Give]]'' was also partially recorded in Brighter Shade Studios.\n\n[[Coy Bowles]] transferred to Atlanta's [[Georgia State University]] to study music. He subsequently became involved in Atlanta's various music scenes, and eventually formed Coy Bowles and the Fellowship in 2004. Two years later, Bowles decided to reconnect with Brown. Through mutual friends, he learned that the Zac Brown Band was scheduled to perform in Atlanta one evening. Bowles and Brown spent the afternoon prior to the performance reacquainting with each other, which ended with Brown inviting Bowles to sit in with his band at that night's performance. To return the favor, Bowles invited the band to attend his own gig with the Fellowship a couple of months later, which in turn resulted in Brown and his band sitting in at that gig.\n\nThis turn of events continued for eight months until Bowles concluded that it was too overwhelming to balance his time with Brown's band and his own band, in addition to other activities; he therefore made a decision to put the Fellowship on an indefinite hiatus, and became a permanent member of the Zac Brown Band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coybowles.com/music/about-zbb/|title=About ZBB|work=Coy Bowles|access-date=November 23, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.coybowles.com/coy/about/|title=About|work=Coy Bowles|access-date=November 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the Zac Brown Band signed to Live Nation Artists Records, in association with Brown's own Home Grown label, after Chris Fryar became an addition to the band. An [[Alabama]] native, Fryar attended the [[University of North Texas]] and the [[Mississippi University for Women]], and made a name for himself in the [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] music scene.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.al.com/mcolurso/2011/05/and_the_beat_goes_on_gardendal.html|title=The beat goes on: Gardendale drummer Chris Fryar earns fame, stays humble in Zac Brown Band (video)|author=Mary Colurso|newspaper=[[The Birmingham News]]|date=May 27, 2011|access-date=November 23, 2011}}</ref> According to Fryar, a mutual friend recommended him to Brown, who was in need of a new drummer for the band.

This song was also recorded by [[The Lost Trailers]], whose 2006 recording was released as a single but withdrawn after Brown decided that he wanted to release it himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/motion-pictures/4477828-1.html |title= BNA Forced To Swap Trailers' Single |access-date=June 19, 2008 |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=March 15, 2006 |work=Radio Monitor}}</ref> Brown also co-wrote \"Simple Life\", a song recorded by The Lost Trailers on their 2006 [[The Lost Trailers (album)|self-titled album]].\n\nIn the third episode of HBO's music documentary series [[Foo Fighters: Sonic Highways|Sonic Highways]], Brown was a featured interviewee and explained why Lost Trailer's version of \"Chicken Fried\" was pulled from the radio. Brown stated that after six years of touring that he was broke and sleeping in his tour van. In 2005 the Lost Trailers contacted Brown and expressed interest in recording \"Chicken Fried\". Brown stated he agreed under the condition that the song would only be an album cut and not a single as he still had hopes of releasing the song as a radio single himself.\n\nBoth parties agreed and the Lost Trailers recorded the song. Some months later the Lost Trailers landed a deal with Sony Nashville, and when they submitted the tracks for their album, they included \"Chicken Fried\". [[Joe Galante]], then the Chairman of Sony Music Nashville, heard the tracks and chose \"Chicken Fried\" as the single that the label wanted to promote.\n\nBrown described hearing his song on the radio: \"The first time I hear 'Chicken Fried' on the radio and it wasn't us singing it. It was a nightmare.\" Brown then called his lawyer to have the song pulled from the radio immediately. Brown's lawyer warned him that because of Galante's power in the Nashville music scene that pulling the song could essentially have him blackballed in Nashville. Brown was insistent that his agreement with the Lost Trailers was violated, so his lawyer issued a [[cease and desist]] letter and the single was pulled from the radio.\n\nA few months later The Zac Brown Band was booked to perform at 3rd and Lindsley in Nashville and producer [[Keith Stegall]] came to watch their performance. Stegall and Brown had drinks later that night and Brown recalled Stegall stating, \"I just had to meet the kid that told Joe Galante to fuck off!\" Brown credits this incident and his meeting and collaboration with Stegall as the beginning of his success in the music business.\n\nIn October 2008, [[Atlantic Records]] acquired distribution of \"Chicken Fried\" after Live Nation Artists closed. The band's album ''[[The Foundation (Zac Brown Band album)|The Foundation]]'' was released under Atlantic Records' newly re-established country division in association with the Home Grown/Bigger Picture label on November 18 of that year.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1043645/zac-brown-band-signs-with-atlantic |title=Zac Brown Band Signs With Atlantic  |access-date=October 29, 2008 |last=Tucker |first=Ken |date=October 29, 2008 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> \"Chicken Fried\" reached No.&nbsp;1 on the country charts that same month, making them the first country band to reach No.&nbsp;1 with a debut single since [[Heartland (country music band)|Heartland]] did so in 2006 with \"[[I Loved Her First (song)|I Loved Her First]]\".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/charts/chart_alert/e3iac81cb9ace3320f8be5a577c0bd8f3ef |title=Beyonce's 'Fierce' Debut Leads Pre-Turkey Day Chart  |access-date=December 7, 2008|date=November 26, 2008 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, Zac Brown Band debuted their new CD, ''Uncaged'', which was well received.

Cook had previously collaborated with [[John Mayer]] and [[Shawn Mullins]], and was also a member of the [[Marshall Tucker Band]] for two years prior to joining the Zac Brown Band.\n\nCook explains how he first met Brown:\n\n{{blockquote|We ran into each other (in) 2003 in a club scene in Atlanta, where my band opened up for his band ... ever since then, we've been friendly ... and I think he just thought I was a singer-songwriter for a long time; and then we were on a (music) cruise ship together ... and I was playing with the Marshall Tucker Band at the time, and (Brown)'s band (also participated in the cruise) ... and he actually got to see me play the guitar ... and then he realized, 'I need this guy in my band,' I guess.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gj69DZ-FHTE| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/Gj69DZ-FHTE| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=ExploreMusic chats with Clay Cook|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=2010-12-10|access-date=2011-11-23}}{{cbignore}}</ref>}}\n\nBrown himself admitted his strong desire to add Cook to the lineup, for he believed Cook's musicianship would enhance the Zac Brown Band's overall musical style:\n\n{{blockquote|I'd been tryin' to get him in the band for three years, and you know, it's been a journey, but I always knew [he could make us better].

Guitarists [[Richie Furay]] and [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], former members of Buffalo Springfield, were joined by multi-instrumentalist [[Rusty Young (musician)|Rusty Young]], bassist [[Randy Meisner]] and drummer [[George Grantham (musician)|George Grantham]].  Meisner quit the band while they were recording their first album, ''[[Pickin' Up the Pieces (Poco album)|Pickin' Up the Pieces]]'', though his bass and backing vocal parts were kept in the final mix.  He was replaced by [[Timothy B. Schmit]] in 1969, and Messina left in 1970 to be replaced by [[Paul Cotton]].  The line-up would change numerous times over the next several decades, with Rusty Young being the only constant member.  A reunion of the founding members occurred in the late 1980s-early 1990s, and the band continued in some form through 2021, though they retired from active touring in 2013, with Young citing health concerns as the primary cause of his retirement. Young died from a heart attack in April 2021.\n\nTo date, the band has released 19 studio albums, the most successful of which was 1978's ''[[Legend (Poco album)|Legend]]'', which featured the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] #17 and Adult Contemporary #1 hit \"[[Crazy Love (Poco song)|Crazy Love]]\". The band's last album was ''[[All Fired Up (Poco album)|All Fired Up]]'' in 2013.\n\nPoco are considered one of the founders of the Southern California country rock sound, and three of the members of the band have been inducted in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as members of other bands (Furay with Buffalo Springfield, Meisner and Schmit with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]). However, the band has yet to receive a nomination since entering eligibility in 1995.\n\n==History==\n\n===Inception===\nDuring recording of [[Buffalo Springfield]]'s third and final album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'', lead singers [[Stephen Stills]], [[Neil Young]] and [[Richie Furay]] each recorded songs without the other members present.  One of Furay's solo efforts was the country-influenced ballad \"Kind Woman\", which he recorded with the help of producer/engineer/bassist [[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]] and [[pedal steel guitar]]ist [[Rusty Young (musician)|Rusty Young]].<ref name=\"Eder\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/poco-mn0000297894/biography\n|work=allmusic.com|title=Poco|first= Bruce|last= Eder}}</ref>\n\nWhen Buffalo Springfield split up, Furay, Messina and Rusty Young decided to start their own group oriented toward such songs. Its original line-up was Furay (vocals and [[rhythm guitar]]), Messina ([[lead guitar]], vocals, producer), Rusty Young ([[pedal steel guitar]], [[banjo]], [[dobro]], guitar, mandolin and vocals), [[George Grantham (musician)|George Grantham]] ([[drum kit|drums]] and vocals) and [[Randy Meisner]] ([[bass guitar|bass]] and vocals). The group was signed to a recording contract with [[Epic Records]], which acquired the rights to Furay from the Springfield's [[Atlantic Records]] subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] label in return for those to [[Graham Nash]] of [[The Hollies]] (who was moving to Atlantic as part of forming [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]]).<ref name=Eder /> Originally, the new group was named \"Pogo\", after the [[Pogo (comics)|Pogo comic strip]] character, but was changed when its creator, [[Walt Kelly]], objected and threatened to sue.\n\n===Furay era (1969\u20131973)===\nTheir debut, ''[[Pickin' Up the Pieces (Poco album)|Pickin' Up the Pieces]]'' (1969), is considered a pioneering album of the country rock genre.<ref>Eder, Bruce.  [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=poco|chart=all}} ''Pickin' Up the Pieces'' review], ''[[Allmusic]]''</ref> The first edition of the Rolling Stone Record Guide edited by [[Dave Marsh]] and John Swenson, gave the release 5 stars, its highest rating, as an essential album. However, the album performed weakly, peaking at No.&nbsp;63 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|album chart]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nThe band's line-up proved to be a problem throughout its career. During the recording of the debut album, Meisner left the group as a result of a conflict with Furay (reportedly, Meisner had objected after Furay barred all but himself and Messina from the first album's final mix playback sessions).<ref>Eliot, Marc. ''To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles''. Da Capo Press, 2004. p.37. {{ISBN|978-0-306-81398-6}}</ref> After a stint playing with [[Ricky Nelson]]'s Stone Canyon Band, Meisner later became a founding member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. Messina briefly took over on bass until [[Timothy B. Schmit]] joined the band in September 1969.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nTheir second studio album ''[[Poco (album)|Poco]]'' (1970) again resulted in low sales, peaking at No.&nbsp;58. However, the band's next album, the live set ''[[Deliverin']]'' (or ''DeLIVErin''' as it is sometimes represented), picked up moderate airplay, Furay's \"C'mon\" hitting No.&nbsp;69. ''Deliverin\u2019'' became Poco's first album to reach the [[Top 40]] on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at No.&nbsp;26.\n\nMessina chose to leave the band in October 1970, feeling Furay exerted too much control over the group's sound. He also was anxious to get off the road and return to his career in studio production. This would lead him ultimately on to [[Loggins & Messina]]. At the recommendation of [[Peter Cetera]] of [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], Messina selected guitarist/singer [[Paul Cotton]], a one-time member of the [[Illinois Speed Press]], to replace him.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nThe realigned Poco, now on its third line-up on just its fourth album, hired [[Steve Cropper]] as [[record producer|producer]] and released ''[[From the Inside (Poco album)|From the Inside]]'' (1971). Again, poor sales were the result as the release landed at No.&nbsp;52.\n\nThe band and its management were dissatisfied with Cropper's production and hired Canadian  [[Jack Richardson (record producer)|Jack Richardson]], who'd had big success with [[The Guess Who]] and oversaw the next three albums, beginning with ''[[A Good Feelin' to Know]]'' (1972). The band built the LP around the title track, a popular concert tune, but the single failed to chart. The album itself peaked at No.&nbsp;69. As a result, Furay became increasingly discouraged with Poco's prospects, especially since ex-bandmates Stills, Young, Meisner and Messina were so successful with their respective groups. In an April 26, 1973 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine interview with [[Cameron Crowe]], he vented that Poco was still a second-billed act and had not increased its audience.\n\nThe next album, ''[[Crazy Eyes]]'' (1973), reached No.&nbsp;38 but Furay departed at its release and joined with [[JD Souther]] and [[Chris Hillman]] to create the [[Souther-Hillman-Furay Band]] on [[Asylum Records]].  Poco decided not to replace Furay and continued as a quartet.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\n===Post-Furay era (1973\u20131977)===\nAfter Furay's departure, the band released their last two albums with Epic; ''[[Seven (Poco album)|Seven]]'' (1974) and ''[[Cantamos]]'' (1974). The albums charted at No.&nbsp;68 and No.&nbsp;76 respectively. Poco left Epic after ''Cantamos'' and signed with [[ABC-Dunhill Records]].\n\n''[[Head Over Heels (Poco album)|Head Over Heels]]'' was their first ABC release, featuring Schmit's acoustic \"Keep On Tryin\" which became the group's most successful single to date, charting at No.&nbsp;50 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Around the time of the release of ''Head Over Heels'', ''[[The Very Best of Poco (1975 album)|The Very Best of Poco]]'' was released as a [[compilation album]] that documented the group's years with Epic.  Epic's release fought with ''Head Over Heels'' for attention though neither charted very well, hitting No.&nbsp;43 and No.&nbsp;90, respectively.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nThe group's next ABC album was ''[[Rose of Cimarron (album)|Rose Of Cimarron]]'' which also failed to generate much enthusiasm and peaked at No.&nbsp;89. Another Epic release also came out in 1976, the live album ''[[Live (Poco album)|Live]]''.\n\nAl Garth (ex-[[Loggins and Messina]]), who guested on ''Head Over Heels'' and ''Rose of Cimarron'', was added to the group's 1976 touring line up on sax and violin, but was gone by the end of that year.\n\nIn the summer of 1976, the group was on the bill with the [[Stills-Young Band]] teaming but was left high and dry when [[Neil Young]] pulled out of the tour, which was then canceled.\n\n''[[Indian Summer (Poco album)|Indian Summer]]'' was released the following spring, peaking at No.&nbsp;57, while the title track reached No.&nbsp;50.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The appearance of [[Steely Dan]]'s [[Donald Fagen]] playing synthesizer on two of the album's tracks marked a move away from the country rock sound the band had primarily been known for.\n\n===Success (1977\u20131980)===\nIn August 1977 Schmit quit to join the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], coincidentally replacing former Poco member Meisner yet again.  As a result, a fully produced live album recorded at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles in July 1977 was shelved by ABC.  After languishing in storage for many years, the album was eventually released by John Thaler and Futuredge Music in partnership with Universal Special Projects as ''[[The Last Roundup (Poco)|The Last Roundup]]'' in 2004.\n\nAfter Schmit's departure, Poco decided to take a break. Grantham took some time off, while Young and Cotton decided to continue as the Cotton-Young Band and redoubled their efforts to succeed.  They selected the Britons Steve Chapman ([[Drum kit|drums]]) and Charlie Harrison ([[bass guitar|bass]], backing vocals; formerly of [[Judas Jump]]), both of whom had played together with [[Leo Sayer]] and [[Al Stewart]], to round out their new quartet.  However, ABC decided to pick up the Cotton-Young album  \u2014 as long as they continued under the Poco name. Thus, although Grantham had never quit Poco, he found himself bought out of the group after he was not happy with the changes in its business setup, including the group's publishing no longer being divided evenly. After a stint with [[McGuinn, Clark & Hillman]], he subsequently landed a job as drummer for [[Ricky Skaggs]].\n\n''[[Legend (Poco)|Legend]]'' (1978), the Cotton-Young album with cover art by graphic artist (and later comedy actor) [[Phil Hartman]], subsequently became the group's most commercially successful LP, containing two Top 20 hits, \"[[Crazy Love (Poco song)|Crazy Love]]\" written and sung by Rusty Young (which also had a seven-week run at Number 1 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary chart]] in early 1979, the biggest hit on the AC chart that year) and Cotton's \"[[Heart of the Night (song)|Heart of the Night]]\".  The album was [[RIAA certification|certified gold]], Poco's first album to achieve this distinction in original distribution.\n\n[[Kim Bullard]] ([[keyboard instrument|keyboards]], backing vocals) joined the band in December 1978 just after ''Legend'' was released.  While \"Crazy Love\" was riding up the charts in early 1979, ABC Records was sold to [[MCA Records]].  Poco was retained by MCA and the ''Legend'' album was reissued on the MCA label.\n\nWith the momentum built up from ''Legend'''s success, Poco were invited by the [[Musicians United for Safe Energy]] (MUSE) collective to play during their concerts at [[Madison Square Garden]] in September 1979. And their new hit \"Heart of the Night\" appeared on the resulting live album ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'', the concerts and album all being in support of nuclear-free energy. Both the concerts and the album also featured several other big artists such as [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Jackson Browne]].\n\n===1980\u20131999===\n[[Image:JimMessina(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|238px|right|[[Jim Messina (musician)|Jim Messina]], founding member of Poco, performing in 2009]]\nDuring the first half of the 1980s, the group released five more albums: ''[[Under the Gun (Poco album)|Under the Gun]]'' (1980), ''[[Blue And Gray]]'' (1981), ''[[Cowboys & Englishmen]]'' (1982) on MCA and, moving over to [[Atlantic Records]], ''[[Ghost Town (Poco)|Ghost Town]]'' (1982) and ''[[Inamorata (Poco)|Inamorata]]'' (1984). Poco failed to duplicate the success achieved by ''Legend'', with each album performing more poorly than its predecessor.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nPoco also contributed the song \"I'll Leave it Up to You\" to ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'''s soundtrack in 1982.\n\nOn ''Inamorata'' the band mostly played down their \"[[Country rock]]\" sound to adopt more of an \"80s style\" with more keyboards and glossy synth sounds as well as electronic drums. The album also featured guest spots by former members Timothy B. Schmit, Richie Furay and George Grantham.\n\nThe group lost its recording contract with Atlantic due to the slow sales of ''Inamorata'' but continued to tour, mostly in small clubs. Bullard left to rejoin [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] in 1983 (but still appeared on the sessions for ''Inamorata'')   and Harrison (who had not played on ''Inamorata'') departed in mid-1984. New members Jeff Steele (bass) and Rick Seratte (keyboards, backing vocals) came in for Poco's 1984 tour dates, but they departed, along with drummer Chapman, to be replaced in 1985 by future [[Great Plains (Tennessee band)|Great Plains]] front man Jack Sundrud (vocals, bass, guitar) and the returning Grantham. Grantham's reunion with Poco was brief, though; In late 1985, [[Steve Wariner]] asked him to join his band. Chapman came back to take over drums again. During this period, the band  relocated to [[Nashville]] and recorded some demos, though no record deal resulted. And after a few scattered live dates for the group in 1986 and 1987, Paul Cotton pursued a solo career and did not perform with Poco again until 1992, while Young played in [[Vince Gill]]'s band.\n\nAfter a lengthy recording hiatus, at the urging of [[Richard Marx]] and his manager Allen Kovac who took on Poco, the band re-emerged on the [[RCA]] label with the successful ''[[Legacy (Poco)|Legacy]]'' (1989), reuniting original members Young, Furay, Messina, Grantham and Meisner twenty years after Poco's debut. Though Timothy B. Schmit and Paul Cotton were also approached to appear on the project, Schmit declined and Cotton, who was busy with his solo career, was bought out of the group and it ended up being only the five originals. The album produced a Top 20 hit, \"Call It Love,\" in the fall of 1989 and another Top 40 hit, \"Nothing to Hide,\" in early 1990, earning Poco its second gold album (in its 19th release).<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/>\n\nThe group (having added a keyboardist, Dave Vanacore) toured in early 1990 opening for Marx and appeared at [[Farm Aid]] IV on April 7, 1990, at the [[Hoosier Dome]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]]. But Furay, now a church minister in Colorado, then had to bow out due to his commitments and Poco toured as a headliner in the summer of 1990 with Sundrud returning to take over rhythm guitar from Furay.\n\nDespite ''Legacy'''s gold status and the two hit singles, the band did not make much money on their 1990 tour, one of the problems being their booking into military bases that turned out to be mostly empty, as the troops were all deployed for the [[Desert Shield]] operation in the [[Persian Gulf]]. RCA ended up dropping them from their roster and recordings for a proposed follow up to ''Legacy'' were abandoned.\n\nIn 1991 Poco toured as an acoustic trio with Young, Messina and Meisner (drummer [[Gary Mallaber]] joined them for dates in Japan that July), mostly to make up dates that were missed the previous year. But by the end of 1991, Messina and Meisner had returned to their individual careers.\n\nAfter Messina and Meisner left, Young formed a side project, Four Wheel Drive, with [[John Cowan]] (from [[New Grass Revival]]), [[Foster & Lloyd|Bill Lloyd]] (from [[Foster & Lloyd]]) and [[Patrick Simmons]] (of [[Doobie Brothers]]). They were signed to a recording deal with [[RCA Records|RCA Nashville]] and completed an album which was never released. [[Warner Bros. Records]] then picked up the group in 1993, but when they were threatened with lawsuits from bands who had already copyrighted the name Four Wheel Drive, they changed the band's name to [[The Sky Kings]]. But their one and only album (minus Simmons who left when the Doobies schedule got too busy), completed in 1997, was not released until 2000, three years after the group disbanded.\n\nIn the meantime, Rusty Young was the sole owner of the Poco name by early 1992 and, though they had not officially disbanded, the band seemed to be quietly fading away. Despite this, Young once again teamed with Cotton, brought in new members Richard Neville (vocals, bass) and Tim Smith (drums) and toured through the end of the decade, although on a very limited schedule. Young and Cotton also occasionally appeared as Poco as an acoustic duo.\n\nOn September 16, 1995, Poco appeared at Deadwood Jam in [[Deadwood, South Dakota]], where former Loggins & Messina drummer Merel Bregante filled in for Tim Smith.\n\n===2000\u20132013===\nPoco again became more active as a touring unit after they signed with Nashville manager Rick Alter and brought back Grantham and Sundrud in June 2000, reuniting the group's 1985 line-up.\n\n''[[Running Horse]]'' (2002) found the band in the studio for the first time in thirteen years. The CD was released through the band's website. Furay, who had continued to make guest appearances at their shows over the years when they played in his adopted home-state of Colorado, reunited with the band again for a sold-out show in Nashville in May 2004, resulting in the CD\u2013DVD release ''[[Keeping the Legend Alive]]'' (2004).\n\nOn July 29 of that same year, during a show at [[Stearns Square]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], Grantham suffered a [[stroke]] during the performance. For their gig the following night at [[Barnstable County, Massachusetts|Barnstable]] County Fair in [[East Falmouth]], MA, Poco brought in local drummer Chuck Woodhams, then called Young's Nashville neighbor, [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] drummer George Lawrence (who had earlier stood in for Tim Smith at some Poco concerts in June 1999) to sub on drums for Grantham for the rest of 2004. He became a permanent member in 2005. Grantham's recovery was slow and expensive and the group created a donor fund on its official website, Poconut.org, to offset some of his considerable medical expenses.\n\nPoco continued to write and record while performing at festivals, performing arts centers, theaters and clubs.  In 2005 they played a short tour in Europe, but Cotton was hospitalized in Norway with health issues and missed the last two shows of the tour. Guitarist and singer Bill Lloyd, of duo [[Foster & Lloyd]], substituted for Cotton for several subsequent shows in the US.\n\nCotton returned in 2006, stabilizing the line-up of Young, Cotton, Sundrud and drummer George Lawrence. Cotton and Sundrud released solo albums and Young started writing an autobiographical history of the band. Poco alumni continued to periodically reunite in concert with this line-up.\n\nBeginning in 2009, Grantham occasionally appeared with the band again but limited his contributions to vocals only.  Richie Furay and Jim Messina returned for several 2008 Poco performances at the Wildwood Lodge in [[Steelville, Missouri]], a tour of California in 2009 ending at the [[Stagecoach Festival]] in Indio (where they were joined by Grantham and Timothy B. Schmit) and several dates opening for [[Loggins and Messina]] featuring Furay, Messina and Grantham.\n\n''[[Bareback at Big Sky]]'' (2005) and  ''[[The Wildwood Sessions]]'' (2006) captured live acoustic versions of songs both new and familiar from their 40-plus year career.   ''Live at Columbia Studios, Hollywood 9/30/71'' (2010) unearthed an unreleased 1971 live performance by Furay, Young, Schmit, Grantham and the then recently recruited Cotton in front of a private audience of family and friends.\n\nIn early 2010, Paul Cotton left Poco abruptly, publicly citing a financial dispute with Young. On his official website he announced he would not be appearing with Poco at the Wildwood concerts, stating \"It was not all that shocking when Rusty told me on February 27 that he would not honor the contract that I had been requesting for over 15 years and that this was goodbye...\" On March 12, 2010, Young responded on Poco's official website: \"It was a sad day when I read on Paul's website that he wasn't coming to Wildwood and I guess that means he's leaving the band.\" Poco immediately reformed with Young, Sundrud, Lawrence and new keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist/singer Michael Webb of [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\nThe band's new incarnation continued to tour and record. In early 2012, a live video of a new song, \"Neil Young\", was released on YouTube as a teaser for a new studio album, ''[[All Fired Up (Poco album)|All Fired Up]]'', that was recorded in Nashville and released in March 2013. Selling on [[iTunes]], the band's website and through a distributor in Europe, Young, Sundrud and Webb penned all the songs on the self-produced album.\n\nIn its 45th year, Rusty Young was the only original member in the band and remained the leader and front man on stage.  He has been the only member of Poco to have performed at every gig and played on every recording since the band's inception in 1968.\n\n===Retirement===\nAt the end of 2013, Rusty Young announced his retirement. At the age of 68, he said he had spent 45 years on the road in the same band and needed a break. A few shows were booked into 2014, including three farewell shows in Florida. One of those shows was a performance in a recording studio in front of a live audience for a DVD documentary of the band's live show. Young said there could be some one-offs in the future after that, but the band would not be actively touring as before. Young was finishing his memoirs for a book to be published. He and Sundrud wrote and recorded music for children's story videos as the \"Session Cats\". Lawrence, Sundrud and Webb continued to write, record and play in their own projects, and to do freelance work with other artists in Nashville, where they live. Young continued to do guest performances with former members of Poco and other country rock artists.\n\nPoco was inducted into the [http://CMHOF.org/ Colorado Music Hall of Fame] (CMHOF) with the CMHOF induction ceremony which took place at the [[Paramount Theatre (Denver, Colorado)]] on January 9, 2015, and included a performance by the following line-up of band members: Paul Cotton, Richie Furay, Timothy B. Schmit, and Rusty Young.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Eagles-Bassist-Timothy-B-Schmit-to-Reunite-with-Poco-at-Paramount-Theater-in-Denver-20141229|title=Eagles Bassist Timothy B.

In 2016 drummer Lawrence was replaced by Rick Lonow (formerly of [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]]). Lex Browning, Jack Sundrud's former bandmate in [[Great Plains (Tennessee band)|Great Plains]], replaced Michael Webb on guitar in the fall of 2018.\n\nIn early 2020, Poco friend and fan Tom Hampton was brought in by Sundrud to replace Browning for tour dates, but touring was suddenly halted in March due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tomhampton.com/bio.html | title=Tom hampton - bio }}</ref>\n\nRusty Young died on April 14, 2021, at his home in Davisville, Missouri, from a heart attack.

However, the reissue had some problems, as it appeared the tape used to remaster ''From the Inside'' had significant damage to it. ''[[Pickin' Up the Pieces (Poco album)|Pickin' Up the Pieces]]'' and ''[[Poco (album)|Poco]]'', the band's first and second albums, were also reissued during this time, with no noticeable damage to the master tapes. The notes give a brief history of the band and the recording of each album.\n\nIn 2006 BGO reissued four more albums, with two albums on each CD: ''[[Seven (Poco album)|Seven]]'' with ''[[Cantamos]]'', the band's seventh and eighth albums, and ''[[Deliverin']]'', the band's first live album, with ''[[Crazy Eyes]]''. Neither set had any bonus tracks as part of the reissue, although there are extensive sleeve notes about Poco's history and the making of the album. The reissues were remastered by Jack Thompson, although it does not note whether or not these were remastered from the original master tapes or the safety masters as previous CDs were.\n\nIn 2011 BGO licensed and reissued remastered editions of four of Poco's ABC/MCA titles, again remastered by Thompson, putting two albums on each CD, with extensive liner notes written by John Tobler. The pairings were ''[[Head over Heels (Poco album)|Head over Heels]]'' with ''[[Rose of Cimarron (album)|Rose of Cimarron]]'', and ''[[Under the Gun (Poco album)|Under the Gun]]'' with ''[[Blue and Gray (album)|Blue and Gray]]''.

He is the winner of the [[America's Got Talent (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.\n\n== Early life and career ==\nSkinner is from the Dublin community of [[Graves County, Kentucky|Graves County]], [[Kentucky]], and started playing the guitar when he was 12 years old. He has been playing, writing, and singing ever since he learned the art of music from his musician father, Joe, who is a fan of [[Hank Williams]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Skinner is divorced and has two children, a daughter and a son. He has worked as a chicken catcher for several years and claims to have caught with his friends up to 60,000 chickens in one night.\n\n== ''America's Got Talent'' ==\n\n=== Audition ===\nSkinner performed in a live audition on the August 4, 2009 episode of ''[[America's Got Talent]]''. He became a fan favorite in the show after his performance of [[Garth Brooks]]' \"[[If Tomorrow Never Comes]]\" while strumming his guitar. Judges Piers Morgan, Sharon Osbourne, and David Hasselhoff all voted \"Yes\", sending him to the Vegas Round.\n\n=== Vegas Round ===\nSkinner then appeared without performing in the Vegas Round. His audition was strong enough for the judges to send him to the Quarterfinals in Episode 411.\n\n=== Quarterfinals ===\nHis Week 1 Quarterfinals performance in Episode 413 consisted of singing Bob Dylan's \"Make You Feel My Love\" while playing the guitar. Kevin received enough votes to be sent to the Semifinals in Episode 414 instead of Mosaic.\n\n=== Semifinals ===\nThe Week 1 Semifinals performance in Episode 421 consisted of Skinner guitar playing and singing \"Always On My Mind\" by [[Brenda Lee]]. Piers Morgan gave him a standing ovation, saying that singing from the heart and soul with real, raw emotion is the whole story about him while the two of them were both teary-eyed as well as the audience, in which Kevin was reminded that he had the ability to move an audience in a way that Piers never saw on AGT before concluding that Kevin is one of his favorites to win the season.\n\nIn the end, Kevin received enough votes to be sent to the Finals in Episode 422 instead of Acrodunk basketball trampoline dance group.\n\n=== Finals ===\nLater in the Finals, Skinner's performance in Episode 425 consisted of singing his rendition of Aerosmith's \"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\" while playing his guitar and having a backup band and vocals.\n\nJudge Piers said the rendition wasn't perfect and had a missed odd note with little flattened places, but described the moment as the point of Skinner's journey as a \"rough diamond\", needing professional training. But remembering the words on how Hasselhoff described Skinner, Piers said that he was what the show was created for while being unemployed and catching chickens the past year at that time. But despite those obstacles, it was a better way for America itself to get out of its recession and have Skinner compete in the show.\n\nEven though Sharon said that he doesn't have the best voice in the contest, she reminded Kevin that he does not need to sound perfect while describing him as one of the greatest and unique icons, similar to [[Johnny Cash]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Lou Reed]], all of whom did not need to have the perfect voices but are all such unique individuals.\n\nThe judges once again all gave him standing ovations.\n\n=== Finale ===\nKevin Skinner received enough votes to be included in the Top 5 in Episode 426 instead of Drew Stevyns. Kevin was revealed to have competed in first place in the competition that same night, in front of [[Barbara Padilla]] who was runner up, [[Recycled Percussion]] in third place, [[The Texas Tenors]] in fourth, and The Voices of Glory in fifth, winning one million dollars and a headline show in Las Vegas.\n\n=== Trivia ===\nDuring AGT's 10 Year Anniversary Special on July 29, 2015, Piers Morgan stated that Kevin Skinner was his favorite act.\n\n=== Performances/results ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

They are best known for hits such as \"Any Way the Wind Blows\" (1989), which was used in the [[soundtrack]] for the film ''[[Pink Cadillac (film)|Pink Cadillac]]'' starring [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Bernadette Peters]], and \"New Shade of Blue\" (1988, their highest-ranking single on the country charts in November of that year). Southern Pacific was named New Country Group of the Year when they debuted and have been honored by having their name added to the Country Music Association's Walkway of Stars in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\n==History==\nThe band was formed in 1983 with former [[The Doobie Brothers|Doobie Brothers]] members [[Keith Knudsen]] and [[John McFee]] and bassist [[Jerry Scheff]]. Additional founding members include [[Timothy Goodman|Tim Goodman]] on vocals and keyboardist [[Glen Hardin]].  The group signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1984 through which their debut album, ''Southern Pacific'' was released the following year. Scheff left after the album debuted and was replaced by [[Stu Cook]] of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], while Kurt Howell replaced Hardin on keyboards. Cook and Howell would join the others in the release of ''Killbilly Hill'' in 1986. This album would feature the cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s \"[[Pink Cadillac (song)|Pink Cadillac]]\". Goodman left after the second album to pursue a solo career and was replaced by [[David Jenkins (musician)|David Jenkins]] (formerly of [[Pablo Cruise]]) in 1987 in time for the production of the group's third album ''Zuma'' (1988) where their highest ranking single \"New Shade of Blue\" was included. Jenkins left after ''Zuma'' and the group remained a quartet for the final album ''County Line'' (1990) which included the single \"Any Way The Wind Blows\" that was used in the ''Pink Cadillac'' soundtrack and film that same year. ''County Line'' also featured a guest appearance from [[The Beach Boys]] on backing vocals on a cover of \"[[GTO (Ronny & the Daytonas song)|GTO]]\" by the Beach Boys' contemporaries [[Ronny & the Daytonas]].<ref name=\"Bellagio Guest Appearances\">{{cite web |display-authors=et al. |last1=Doe |first1=Andrew G. |title=Guest Appearances |url=http://bellagio10452.com/guesting.html |website=Bellagio10452.com |access-date=July 11, 2024}}</ref>\nSouthern Pacific covered the [[Roky Erickson]] song \"It's a Cold Night For Alligators\" for the tribute album ''[[Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye: A Tribute to Roky Erickson]]''. (Cook had produced more than a dozen of Erickson's songs in 1979, which became Erickson's album ''[[The Evil One]]''.)<ref name=AusChron2017>{{cite news |last=Bentley |first=Bill |date=2017-04-21 |title=Record Store Day Unearths a Roky Erickson Rarity |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2017-04-21/record-store-day-unearths-a-roky-erickson-rarity/ |work=[[Austin Chronicle]] |location=[[Austin, Texas]] |access-date=2020-09-10 }}</ref> The group disbanded and Warner Bros. released their ''Greatest Hits'' album in 1991.\n\nAfter Southern Pacific's breakup, Knudsen and McFee and Cook formed the super group, Jackdawg, and recorded one album that received critical acclaim. Subsequently both McFee and Knudsen returned to The Doobie Brothers (who had already reunited in 1987). Knudsen died in 2005 while McFee continues to tour with The Doobies. Cook toured with fellow Creedence Clearwater Revival band member [[Doug Clifford]] with the group Cosmo's Factory (now [[Creedence Clearwater Revisited]]). Goodman continued to tour and record with The Magic Music Band and his solo project, The Tim Goodman Band. Howell formed his own music group, called [[Burnin' Daylight]]. This group also included former [[Exile (American band)|Exile]] member Sonny LeMaire and Nashville songwriter Marc Beeson.\n\nSouthern Pacific's four studio albums were reissued in 2003 by specialty label [[Wounded Bird Records]] in two double-CD packages.\n\nCook was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] with Creedence Clearwater Revival in 1993. Both Knudsen (posthumous) and McFee were inducted with the Doobie Brothers in 2020.\n\n===Band members===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" border=1 cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 style=\"float: lleft; width: 475px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #E2E2E2;\"\n|-\n! bgcolor=\"#E7EBEE\" | 1983\u20131986\n|\n*'''[[Keith Knudsen]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[drum kit|drums]], [[percussion instrument|percussion]], [[background vocals]]\n*'''[[John McFee]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[lead guitar]], [[steel guitar]], [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], [[fiddle]], [[resonator guitar]], [[electric sitar]], [[harmonica]], background vocals, some lead vocals\n*'''[[Tim Goodman]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[lead vocals]], [[rhythm guitar]], [[synthesizer]]\n*'''[[Glen D.

He first achieved mainstream attention in 1986 with the release of his debut album ''[[Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.]]''. Yoakam had considerable success throughout the late 1980s onward, with a total of ten studio albums for [[Reprise Records]]. Later projects have been released on Audium (now [[MNRK Music Group]]), [[New West Records|New West]], [[Warner Records|Warner]], and [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]].\n\nHis first three albums{{mdash}}''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'', ''[[Hillbilly Deluxe (Dwight Yoakam album)|Hillbilly Deluxe]]'', and ''[[Buenas Noches from a Lonely Room]]''{{mdash}}all reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart. Yoakam also has two number-one singles on [[Hot Country Songs]] with \"[[Streets of Bakersfield]]\" (a duet with [[Buck Owens]]) and \"[[I Sang Dixie]]\", and twelve additional top-ten hits. He has won two [[Grammy Award]]s and one [[Academy of Country Music]] award. 1993's ''[[This Time (Dwight Yoakam album)|This Time]]'' is his most commercially successful album, having been [[music recording sales certification|certified]] triple-platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).\n\nYoakam's musical style draws from a wide variety of influences including [[alternative country]], [[neotraditional country]], [[honky-tonk]], [[Rock music|rock]] and the [[Bakersfield sound]]. He is known for his distinctive tenor singing voice, unconventional musical image, and the lead guitar work of his longtime producer and bandleader [[Pete Anderson]]. Yoakam writes most of his own songs but has recorded many successful [[cover song]]s by a wide range of artists including [[Johnny Horton]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Cheap Trick]], [[The Blasters]], [[Lefty Frizzell]], and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. He has collaborated with [[Beck]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Ralph Stanley]], and members of [[Alison Krauss & Union Station]].\n\nAs an actor, Yoakam has appeared in the movies ''[[Red Rock West]]'', ''[[Sling Blade]]'', ''[[Panic Room]]'', ''[[The Minus Man]]'', and ''[[Wedding Crashers]]'', as well as ''[[South of Heaven, West of Hell]]'', which he wrote and directed. He also appeared in the TV series ''[[P.S. I Luv U]]'' and ''[[Under the Dome (TV series)|Under the Dome]]'', as well as the [[Amazon Prime Video]] original series ''[[Goliath (TV series)|Goliath]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Main at Grace in Pikeville.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Dwight Yoakam was born in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]].|alt=A view of buildings along a street in Pikeville, Kentucky.]]\nDwight David Yoakam was born October 23, 1956, in [[Pikeville, Kentucky]].<ref name=\"whitburn\"/><ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dwight-yoakam-mn0000791483/biography | title=Dwight Yoakam biography | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=September 2, 2022 | author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]]}}</ref> He is the oldest of three children to David Yoakam and his wife, Ruth Ann Tibbs Yoakam.

Although Yoakam later broke this guitar, he received another one as a Christmas present while he was in the fourth grade. He also wrote his first song around this point.<ref name=\"roots\"/> As a child, Yoakam took influence from the music that his parents listened to on [[phonograph record|records]] as well as [[WMNI]], then an [[AM broadcasting|AM]] country music radio station in Columbus.<ref name=\"roots\"/> Among these records were compilations by [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Johnny Horton]].<ref name=\"roots\"/> According to his mother, the family would also sing songs to each other when on road trips to visit Yoakam's maternal grandparents. Yoakam himself also stated that he was influenced by [[rock and roll]] acts he had seen on television, such as [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=\"roots\"/>\n\nThe Yoakam family moved to another neighborhood of Columbus in 1968, where Yoakam attended [[Northland High School]]. His mother encouraged all three of her children to join the school's band, in which Yoakam played drums. He also attended drama class at Northland High School, which led to him playing the role of Charlie in a production of ''[[Flowers for Algernon]]''. Yoakam later attributed this performance as giving him more confidence performing in front of others.<ref name=\"roots\"/> In his senior year of high school, Yoakam and some classmates formed a [[rock and roll]] band to compete in the school's talent show.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"roots\"/> The band became popular enough that they began performing at a number of private parties throughout Columbus as The Greaser Band. Yoakam attended [[Ohio State University]], but quickly dropped out in order to focus on his musical career.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> While playing at a club in [[Gahanna, Ohio]], Yoakam was approached by a man who promised a musical contract but later turned out to be a [[con artist]]. Despite this, Yoakam chose to move to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to continue pursuing a career in country music. He faced difficulty in the Nashville music scene, as his style was more indebted to [[honky-tonk]] and [[bluegrass music]] at a time when such sounds were not popular compared to [[country pop]] and [[Nashville sound]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nYoakam then moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], at the encouragement of Billy Alves, a former member of the Greaser Band. While he was initially unsuccessful there as well, he met guitarist and record producer [[Pete Anderson]] at a Los Angeles bar in 1982. The two became friends when they realized they had common interest in musicians such as [[Merle Haggard]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Anderson also observed that [[cowpunk]] and [[alternative country]] were popular in California through acts such as [[Joe Ely]], [[Rank and File (band)|Rank and File]], and [[Lone Justice]]. By performing at clubs where these acts also performed, Yoakam was thus able to gain further exposure.<ref name=\"roots\"/>\n\n==Musical career==\n===1984{{ndash}}1986: ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.''===\n[[File:PeteAnderson(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Pete Anderson]], seen here in 2009, produced and played lead guitar on the majority of Yoakam's albums.|alt=Musician Pete Anderson playing an electric guitar.]]\nBy 1984, Yoakam had written a large number of songs. Anderson then encouraged him to record some of them on an [[extended play]]. He also served as producer and lead guitarist on the project, roles he would serve throughout most of Yoakam's career.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/> The EP was titled ''[[Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.]]'' and was released through the [[Oak Records]] label. It consisted of five of Yoakam's original compositions, plus a cover of [[Johnny Cash]]'s \"[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]\".<ref name=\"roots\"/> Songs from the extended play received airplay on independent radio stations throughout Los Angeles.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Later in the year Yoakam was chosen to serve as an opening act for [[The Blasters]]. This led to him being discovered by [[Reprise Records]] executive Paige Levy, who helped Yoakam sign with the label in 1986.<ref name=\"roots\"/> Reprise re-issued ''Guitars, Cadillacs, Etc., Etc.'' that year with four more tracks, thus making it his debut album.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> One of the added tracks was \"Bury Me\", a duet with [[Maria McKee]].<ref name=\"etc review\"/> The first single off the album was a cover of [[Johnny Horton]]'s 1956 single \"[[Honky-Tonk Man|Honky Tonk Man]]\". Yoakam's rendition of the song charted at number three on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] in mid-1986.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The song was even more successful in Canada, reaching the number one position on that nation's country music charts then published by ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/CANADA/RPM/80s/1986/RPM-1986-06-28.pdf | title=RPM country singles | journal=RPM | pages=12 | date=June 28, 1986}}</ref> \"Honky Tonk Man\" also received a [[music video]], which in 1986 became the first by a country artist to air on [[MTV]].<ref name=\"gq\">{{cite web | url=https://www.gq.com/story/dwight-yoakam-honky-tonk-tales | title=Tall Tales With Dwight Yoakam | publisher=[[GQ]] | date=March 17, 2020 | access-date=September 3, 2022 | author=Alex Pappademas}}</ref> The album itself reached the number one position on ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums.<ref name=\"Country Albums\">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=dwight yoakam|chart=Country Albums C}}|title=Dwight Yoakam Album & Song Chart History \u2013 Country Albums|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\nTwo more singles followed, both of which Yoakam wrote himself.

Its founding members were [[Tim Rushlow]] (lead and background vocals, acoustic guitar), [[Brady Seals]] (lead and background vocals, keyboards), Del Gray (drums), Porter Howell (lead guitar, background vocals), Dwayne O'Brien (acoustic guitar, lead and background vocals), and Duane Propes (bass guitar, background vocals). Signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] Nashville in 1991, Little Texas released its debut album ''[[First Time for Everything]]'' that year. The album's lead off single, \"[[Some Guys Have All the Love]]\", reached a peak of No.&nbsp;8 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts. Little Texas charted thirteen top-40 hits between then and 1995, including the number one \"[[My Love (Little Texas song)|My Love]]\" in 1994. Their debut album earned a gold certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), while 1993's ''[[Big Time (Little Texas album)|Big Time]]'' was certified double platinum and 1994's ''[[Kick a Little]]'' was certified platinum.\n\nSeals left the band in 1994 and was replaced by Jeff Huskins (keyboards, fiddle). After a [[Greatest Hits (Little Texas album)|''Greatest Hits'']] package and a [[Little Texas (album)|self-titled]] fourth studio album, the group disbanded in 1997. Seals went on to record three solo albums and one as the lead singer of [[Hot Apple Pie]], Rushlow recorded one solo album and one as the lead singer of [[Rushlow]], and Howell recorded one as a member of Hilljack. Gray, Howell, O'Brien, and Propes re-established Little Texas in 2004 with new lead singer Steven Troy; he left the band in 2006 and Howell took over lead vocals. Under the four-piece lineup, the band has recorded two albums for [[Montage Music Group]]: ''[[The Very Best of Little Texas: Live and Loud]]'' and ''[[Missing Years (album)|Missing Years]]''.\n\n== History ==\nLittle Texas was founded in 1988. Prior to the band's formation, [[Tim Rushlow]] and Dwayne O'Brien began playing together in [[Arlington, Texas]], in 1984. Porter Howell and Duane Propes got together while they were in high school in 1983 and moved to Nashville to attend [[Belmont University]]. [[Brady Seals]] and Del Gray played in the backup band of country music singer [[Josh Logan (country singer)|Josh Logan]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Rushlow, O'Brien, Propes, and Howell first started making music at [[Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center|Opryland]] as a 1950s show band. With both Rushlow's first wife and Howell's wife, plus two other members, they took the show band on the road, naming their act \"The Varsities\".\n\nWhen two of the members left to pursue other interests, they contacted their old friends Gray and Seals, whom they had met while playing in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], in hopes of forging a more country/Southern rock sound. All six members eventually moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they started playing together. The band played at venues across the United States (around 300 dates a year), eventually catching the attention of Nashville's division of [[Warner Bros. Records]].\n\n==Musical career==\n===1991-1993: ''First Time for Everything''===\n{{multiple image\n| width1 = 108\n| image1 = Tim Rushlow 2011.jpg\n| width2 = 120\n| image2 = Bradyseals.jpg\n| footer = [[Tim Rushlow]] (left) and [[Brady Seals]] (right) were both in the original lineup.\n}}\nWarner Bros. signed Little Texas in 1989, and two years later, the band released their debut single \"[[Some Guys Have All the Love]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/little-texas-mn0000266151/biography|title=Little Texas biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|author2=Sean Westergaard |website=AllMusic|accessdate=2009-04-09}}</ref> This song, which reached No.&nbsp;8 on the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts, was the first of five singles from their debut album ''[[First Time for Everything]]''.

Their most successful album, it was certified 2\u00d7Platinum by the RIAA and gold by the [[Music Canada|CRIA]]. It also produced a minor crossover hit in leadoff single \"[[What Might Have Been]]\", a No.&nbsp;2 country hit that also reached No.&nbsp;74 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No.&nbsp;16 on [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]]. After it came \"[[God Blessed Texas]]\" and their only number 1 hit on ''Billboard'', \"[[My Love (Little Texas song)|My Love]]\", both of which were also minor Hot 100 entries. The latter also featured Seals on lead vocals.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Finishing off ''Big Time'' was the No.&nbsp;14 \"[[Stop on a Dime]]\". In late 1993, the band contributed a cover of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' \"[[Peaceful Easy Feeling]]\" to the multi-artist compilation album ''[[Common Thread: The Songs of the Eagles]]''.

After the album's release, however, Seals left for a solo career on [[Reprise Records]], and was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Jeff Huskins, a former backing musician for [[Clint Black]], for their tour to promote the album.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Huskins made his first appearance on \"[[Life Goes On (Little Texas song)|Life Goes On]]\" and \"Country Crazy\", two new tracks that the band recorded for their 1995 ''[[Greatest Hits (Little Texas album)|Greatest Hits]]''. Both of these songs were released as singles. The former became their final Top 40 hit with a peak of No.&nbsp;5, while \"Country Crazy\" stopped at No.&nbsp;44. Also in 1995, the band sang on the track \"Party All Night\", a musical track which featured snippets from a [[Jeff Foxworthy]] sketch and a sung chorus by the band. This song reached No.&nbsp;53, and later appeared on Foxworthy's 1996 album ''[[Crank It Up: The Music Album]]''.\n\n===1997-1998: ''Little Texas''===\nLittle Texas' fourth album was [[Little Texas (album)|self-titled]]. Lead-off single \"Bad for Us\" peaked at No.&nbsp;45, followed by their two lowest-charting singles, \"Your Mama Won't Let Me\" and \"The Call\" at No.&nbsp;64 and No.&nbsp;71 respectively. The band also charted that year with a cover of \"[[Kiss the Girl]]\", a song from the Disney film ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' which they recorded on ''[[The Best of Country Sing the Best of Disney]]''. Seals also charted his only Top 40 solo hit that year, the No.&nbsp;32 \"[[Another You, Another Me]]\". Seals would record a total of three albums between then and 2003. After ''Little Texas'', the band broke up.\n\n===Hiatus and status of former members===\n[[File:Little Texas 2011.jpg|thumb|Little Texas Live]]\nDuring the band's hiatus, Del Gray co-wrote [[Trace Adkins]]' 2000 single \"[[More (Trace Adkins song)|More]]\". Former frontman Tim Rushlow signed to [[Atlantic Records]] as a solo artist that same year, releasing a [[Tim Rushlow (album)|self-titled album]]. Although it accounted for four singles, including the No.&nbsp;8 \"[[She Misses Him]]\", Atlantic closed its country music division in 2001. Rushlow then founded a second band, [[Rushlow]], whose members included his cousin Doni Harris. Rushlow released two singles and one album (''[[Right Now (Rushlow album)|Right Now]]'') on [[Lyric Street Records]], but disbanded by 2004. Seals founded the band [[Hot Apple Pie]], which released a [[Hot Apple Pie (album)|self-titled album]] and three singles in 2005, while Rushlow and Harris founded the duo [[Rushlow Harris]] a year later. In addition, Howell recorded one album in the band Hilljack, which also included former solo artist [[Paul Jefferson]].<ref>{{cite magazine | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0REEAAAAMBAJ | title=Dualtone gets Moore involved in promotion | author=Phyllis Stark | magazine=Billboard |date=November 1, 2003 | pages=36}}</ref>\n\n===Reunion===\nDuane Propes, Del Gray, Porter Howell, and Dwayne O'Brien decided to reunite Little Texas in 2004.

[[Ian Tyson]] sang, played guitar and composed. [[Sylvia Tyson]] sang, composed and occasionally played piano. The other founding members were [[Amos Garrett]] on guitar and occasional vocals, [[Ben Keith]] on steel guitar, [[Ken Kalmusky]] on bass and Ricky Marcus on drums. They were named after the song, \"[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|The Great Speckled Bird]]\", as recorded by [[Roy Acuff]] (1936).<ref>https://www.45worlds.com/78rpm/record/8740us {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2024}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nThe group was featured in the film ''[[Festival Express]]'', a documentary about the music festival of the same name that took place in 1970. The shows were scheduled, and the performers traveled by train, across Canada. In the film, Great Speckled Bird performs \"[[C.C. Rider]]\", along with [[Delaney Bramlett]] and members of the [[Grateful Dead]]. A performance of the [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]]/[[Richard Manuel|Manuel]] song \"[[Tears of Rage]]\", without the aforementioned accompaniment, is included in the extra features of the DVD release.\n\nIn 1970, the group became the house band for the television show ''Nashville North'', produced by the [[CTV Television Network|CTV network]] and filmed at the [[CFTO-TV]] studios in Toronto, which, after one season, became the ''Ian Tyson Show''.<ref>J.

Fuller started the band in 1970 and McGrail named it after a fictional 19th century [[Temperance movement|temperance union]] featured in the 1939 [[Errol Flynn]] cowboy film ''[[Dodge City (1939 film)|Dodge City]]''. In 1975 the band scored its biggest hit with the single \"[[Amie (song)|Amie]]\", a track that originally appeared on their 1972 album ''[[Bustin' Out]]''. Pure Prairie League scored five consecutive Top 40 LPs in the 1970s and added a sixth in the 1980s. They disbanded in 1988 but regrouped in 1998 and continue to perform. The line-up has been fluid over the years, with no one member having served over the band's entire history. The band's most recent line-up consists of Call, drummer Scott Thompson, keyboardist Randy Harper, guitarist Jeff Zona and bassist Jared Camic. Other notable musicians to have played with Pure Prairie League include guitarists [[Vince Gill]], [[Gary Burr]] and [[Curtis Wright]].\n\n==History==\nThe band was formed in Columbus, Ohio in 1970 and had its first success in [[Cincinnati]]. Craig Fuller, Tom McGrail, Jim Caughlan and John David Call had played together in various bands since high school, notably the Vikings, the Omars, the Sacred Turnips and the Swiss Navy.\n\nIn 1970 the first Pure Prairie League line-up was Fuller, McGrail, singer/songwriter/guitarist George Ed Powell (a popular Cincinnati folk singer), Phill Stokes (bassist in Columbus bands Sanhedrin Move and [[J.D. Blackfoot]]) and Robin Suskind (a popular guitar teacher in the [[University of Cincinnati]] neighborhood) on guitar and [[mandola]], with John David Call joining the band later that year. Call's steel guitar added country credibility to the band's playlist and sparked guitar duels with Fuller that created the signature sound of the band. They rose to popularity as the house band at New Dilly's Pub in the Mt. Adams section of Cincinnati.\n\nIn mid-1971, McGrail and Stokes left the band to rehearse with {{ill|Bill Bartlett (musician)|lt=Bill Bartlett|fr|Bill Bartlett|vertical-align=sup}}, but were unable to put a viable band together. Jim Caughlan, who had played guitar and drums with Fuller, Call and McGrail in earlier bands, took over on drums, and Jim Lanham from California, formerly of The Yellow Payges and Country Funk, replaced Stokes on bass.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=984}}</ref> Suskind departed as well, soon after the arrival of Caughlan and Lanham. \n\nEarly on, Pure Prairie League was looking for national artist representation and made contact with a well-known Cleveland based rock and roll promoter, Roger Abramson. At the behest of the group's roadie Jim \"Westy\" Westermeyer (who had also worked for the [[James Gang]]), Abramson saw the band at New Dilly's Pub and later signed them to a management contract. Abramson was able to land a contract with [[RCA Records]]. He then placed Pure Prairie League as an opening act with many of the concerts he produced at that time.\n\nTheir self-titled [[Pure Prairie League (album)|first album]] used a [[Norman Rockwell]] ''[[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]'' cover, showing a trail-worn cowboy named Luke, who would appear on the cover of every Pure Prairie League recording thereafter.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After releasing their debut album (recorded in New York City) in March 1972 and embarking on a nationwide tour, Call, Caughlan and Lanham all left the band.\n\nAt that point, Pure Prairie League owed RCA another album and Craig Fuller agreed to record the second record in RCA's [[Toronto]] studio with the help of George Ed Powell and Bob Ringe (who had also produced the first album). Al Brisco played [[pedal steel guitar]] on the session.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} ''Bustin' Out'' (begun in the summer of 1972) was produced by Ringe and featured the songs of Fuller and Powell.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Billy Hinds from Cincinnati (drums, percussion) joined the band and Hinds's friend, Michael Connor, played [[piano]] on most of the sessions and would become a regular in the Pure Prairie League line-up for years to come. [[Mick Ronson]] added string arrangements to several tracks, most notably \"Boulder Skies\" and \"Call Me Tell Me\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Michael Reilly, who would become the longtime bass player and front man for the band, joined in early September 1972, soon after the record was completed. ''Bustin' Out'' was released in October 1972.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nShortly afterward, the group returned to Ohio and Fuller had to face trial for charges of draft evasion in [[Kentucky]]. Before [[conscientious objector]] (C.O.) status could be arranged, he was sentenced to six months in jail and forced to leave Pure Prairie League in February 1973. At this point, RCA dropped the band and their future looked bleak.\n\nBy August 1973, the band members were in Cincinnati and managed to persuade Call to return. Fuller, though out of prison by now, was working the late shift in a community hospital to satisfy his C.O. requirements, and was not inclined to rejoin at that time. (He was eventually given a full pardon by President [[Gerald Ford]].) Reilly took over as the band's leader and front man and brought in his friend Larry Goshorn (vocals, guitars) to replace Fuller in November 1973. Goshorn had played in a popular Ohio band called [[the Sacred Mushroom]].\n\nPure Prairie League hit the road and began playing gigs constantly, mostly in the Northeast, Midwest, and Southeast. As a result of their heavy schedule, particularly at colleges, their songs became well known; \"[[Amie (song)|Amie]]\" (Craig Fuller's ode to an on-again/off-again relationship), from the second album, became a particular favorite.\n\n==Success==\nAs \"[[Amie (song)|Amie]]\" grew in popularity, radio stations began receiving requests for it. As a result, RCA re-released the ''Bustin' Out'' and ''Pure Prairie League '' albums and issued \"Amie\" as a single. It peaked at No.&nbsp;27 on April 26, 1975, just as a minor bluegrass revival was underway on mid-western college campuses.\n\nRCA re-signed Pure Prairie League and their third album, ''Two Lane Highway'', was released in June 1975.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> It featured guest appearances by [[Chet Atkins]], fiddler [[Johnny Gimble]], [[Don Felder]] from [[The Eagles]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], who dueted with the band on the song \"Just Can't Believe It\", which received much airplay on country stations. ''Highway'' was the band's highest 'charter' at No.&nbsp;24, and ''Bustin' Out'' reached gold status. This began a string of five consecutive Top 40 album releases, as ''If the Shoe Fits'' (January 1976), ''Dance'' (November 1976) and ''Live, Takin' the Stage'' (September 1977) all made the Top 40.\n\nIn 1977 Call left because of increasing back troubles. Larry Goshorn's brother, Tim, joined in time to record ''Just Fly'' (March 1978). But in 1978 there was a mass exodus as the Goshorns left to form their own group, The Goshorn Brothers, and Powell, the last remaining original member, retired from the road to run his pig farm in Ohio. However, the group soldiered on, as Reilly quickly brought in temporary members, California country rocker Chris Peterson (vocals, guitar) and the group's soundman, Jeff Redefer (guitar), to play a few shows until new, permanent players could be located.\n\nIn September 1978 auditions led to the hiring of [[Vince Gill]] (vocals, guitars, mandolin, banjo, fiddle).<ref name=\"AMG\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/pure-prairie-league-mn0000371879/biography|title=Pure Prairie League &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref> Further auditions brought in Steven Patrick Bolin (vocals, guitars, flute) in January 1979.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> This revamped line-up recorded ''[[Can't Hold Back (Pure Prairie League album)|Can't Hold Back]]'' (June 1979), which turned out to be their last for RCA.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Sax player Jeff Kirk accompanied the band on some of their dates during the 1979 tour.\n\n[[Casablanca Records]], who at this time was trying to play down its reputation as primarily a [[disco]] label, signed Pure Prairie League and other non-dance acts to its roster in 1980.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In January, guitarist Jeff Wilson came in to replace Bolin, and the band's next release, ''[[Firin' Up]]'' (February 1980) spawned the hits \"[[Let Me Love You Tonight]]\" and \"I'm Almost Ready\", both sung by Gill, with [[saxophone]] accompaniment by [[David Sanborn]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> A second Casablanca release, ''[[Something in the Night]]'' (February 1981), kept Pure Prairie League on the charts with \"Still Right Here in My Heart\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> However, as fate would have it, Casablanca ultimately went bankrupt and was sold to [[Polygram Records]]. Polygram then dropped most of Casablanca's roster, including Pure Prairie League.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nBoth Gill and Wilson left in early 1982, and Gill pursued a successful solo country career.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Later years==\nDespite the lack of a recording contract, the group still found itself in demand as a live act and played in clubs and at outdoor festivals.\n\nTim Goshorn returned in 1982 and Mike Hamilton (vocals, guitars, from [[Kenny Loggins]]' band) also joined the same year and was there for six months (until mid-1982) and joined again in 1987 for touring and for the recording of \u201cMementos\u201d. \nAl Garth (vocals, woodwinds, fiddle, keyboards), another Loggins alumnus ([[Loggins & Messina]], also [[Poco (band)|Poco]] and [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]), joined as well, from 1982 to 1985.\n\nLongtime drummer Billy Hinds retired from the road in 1984. He was first succeeded by Merel Bregante (also ex-Loggins & Messina and Nitty Gritty Dirt Band) and then by Joel Rosenblatt (1985\u20131986) and Steve Speelman (ex-Steele) (1986\u20131988). Sax player Dan Clawson took over for Garth in 1985 and [[Gary Burr]] (vocals, guitars) was a member from 1984 to 1985.\n\n1985 also saw the return of the group's co-founder Craig Fuller (who had fronted the groups [[American Flyer (band)|American Flyer]] and Fuller/Kaz in the mid-to-late 1970s, after he had returned to music).\n\n''Mementos 1971-1987'', which contained re-recordings of their best known material plus four new songs, was released on the small Rushmore label in December 1987 and was recorded back in Ohio, where the band had returned their home base. It featured guest appearances from many of the band's alumni, including Gill, Powell, the Goshorns, Call, Burr, Rosenblatt and Mike Hamilton.\n\nIn 1988 the band decided to call it quits. Fuller, who had already joined a reformed [[Little Feat]] in 1987, played with Pure Prairie League for their final shows in the spring of 1988.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\n==Rebirth==\nA decade later (in 1998), Pure Prairie League was back with a line-up of Fuller, Connor, Reilly, Burr, [[Fats Kaplin]] (pedal steel guitar, mandolin, banjo, fiddle, accordion, washboard) and Rick Schell (vocals, drums, percussion). After two years, Burr was succeeded by [[Curtis Wright]] (vocals, guitars) in June 2000 and the group began work on a new album in 2002, yet abandoned the sessions and separated again after Schell became busy with other projects.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nMichael Connor (born December 7, 1949) died after a long battle with cancer on September 2, 2004, at age 54.<ref name=\"obit\">{{cite web |url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/heraldtribune/obituary.aspx?n=michael-edward-connor&pid=86261376|title=Michael Edward Connor|last=|first=|date=September 6, 2004|access-date=May 19, 2021|website=Legacy.com}}</ref> Following Connor's death, the group resumed touring once again with Fuller, Reilly, Schell, Wright and Kaplin (when available) and released ''All in Good Time'' in November 2005.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Their first album in 18 years, this release appeared on the small Drifter's Church label.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>\n\nSince this time, Pure Prairie League has continued to tour, playing a handful of shows every year. Donnie Lee Clark replaced Curtis Wright in late 2006 after Wright joined [[Reba McEntire]]'s band. Mike Reilly was sidelined in 2006 after he was forced to undergo a liver transplant. Jack Sundrud (from [[Poco (band)|Poco]]) came in to sub for Reilly. Rick Plant also did a brief stint with them on bass before relocating to Australia in late 2006. Jeff \"Stick\" Davis (from [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]]) sat in on bass for Mike in 2007. In May 2007 Reilly appeared at a few shows and played guitar yet was unable to come back full-time until 2008. John David Call played some concerts in 2006 & 2007, standing in for Kaplin, and returned to the band full-time in June 2010.\n\nAs of May 2011, it was announced, via the Pure Prairie League website, that Fuller would not be appearing at all of the band's shows that year, as he decided to take a break from touring. He ended up leaving the group again altogether by 2012. On February 10, 2012 at The Syndicate in [[Newport, Kentucky]], Fuller, his son Patrick, Tommy McGrail, and George Ed Powell (a frequent guest at their Ohio shows in recent years) took to the stage to join the current Pure Prairie League line-up of John David Call, Mike Reilly, Rick Schell and Donnie Lee Clark.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> In May 2012 Scott Thompson (vocals, drums, percussion) replaced Rick Schell, who departed to continue to grow his real estate business.\n\nFormer member Tim Goshorn (born November 27, 1954) died at his home in [[Williamstown, Kentucky]] after a bout with cancer on April 15, 2017, at age 62.<ref name=\"obit2\">{{cite web |url=https://www.middendorf-funeralhome.com/obituary/5916112|title=Tim Paul Goshorn November 27, 1954 - April 15, 2017|access-date=May 19, 2021|website=Middendorf-funeralhome.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018 the group added additional member Randy Harper on vocals, guitar and keyboards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pureprairieleague.com/about-us/|title=About Us &#124; Pure Prairie League|website=Pureprairieleague.com|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref>\n\nTim Goshorn's brother Larry, who had played with Pure Prairie League from 1973 to 1978, also fell victim to cancer and died on September 14, 2021.<ref>[https://local12.com/news/local/local-musician-larry-goshorn-has-died-cincinnati-pure-prairie-league-tim-cancer \"Local musician Larry Goshorn has died\", ''WKRC'', December 15, 2021].

She graduated from high school in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], where she attended the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City|University of Missouri]] for three semesters and worked at waitressing and office jobs before beginning to pursue the musical career she had dreamed of since singing along to the radio as a child.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Larson eventually settled in [[San Francisco, California]], where she worked in a record store (Discount Records, on [[Telegraph Avenue]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], which also sold tickets for shows at the [[Fillmore West]] and [[Winterland]]) and for the Golden Gate Country Bluegrass Festival. Turning to singing, her performance career began with  a booking as the opening act for [[Eric Andersen]] at The Egress, a club in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]]. In 1975, Larson auditioned for [[Hoyt Axton]], who was producing [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]]. This led to Larson singing with Hoyt Axton and The Banana Band, who were opening for [[Joan Baez]] on the \"Diamonds and Rust\" tour in 1975. She earned her first recording credit on Commander Cody's 1975 album ''Tales From the Ozone'', toured with his band and also provided background vocals on subsequent Commander Cody albums in 1977 and 1978. Other early career singing credits were for Axton and [[Guy Clark]], both in 1976; the following year her resume included further credits with [[Mary Kay Place]], [[Rodney Crowell]], [[Billy Joe Shaver]], [[Jesse Colin Young]], [[Jesse Winchester]], and [[Gary Stewart (singer)|Gary Stewart]].\n\nLarson and Guthrie Thomas both had their first professional recording session on Axton's ''Southbound'' album for A&M Records. As newcomers to the recording industry, they were listed on the back cover of the album as \"Street Singers\", entirely separate from the highly paid, more established artists also appearing on the album.<ref>{{Cite web |title = Nicolette Larson (vocal credits) |url = http://www.discogs.com/artist/249839-Nicolette-Larson?filter_anv=0&type=Credits |website = Discogs |access-date = 2016-01-14}}</ref>\n\nLarson's work with [[Emmylou Harris]] \u2013 whose 1977 album ''[[Luxury Liner (album)|Luxury Liner]]'' prominently showcased Larson on the song \"Hello Stranger\" \u2013 led to her meeting and then befriending Harris's associate and friend [[Linda Ronstadt]]. In 1977, Larson was at Ronstadt's [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home when neighbor [[Neil Young]] phoned to ask Ronstadt if she could recommend a female vocal accompanist. Ronstadt suggested Larson; she was the third person that day to mention Larson to Young. He came over to meet Larson, who recalled, \"Neil ran down all the songs he had just written, about twenty of them. We sang harmonies with him and he was jazzed.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.theuncool.com/journalism/rs280-nicolette-larson |title=Nicolette Larson's Time Has Come |first=Cameron |last=Crowe |author-link=Cameron Crowe |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |number=280 |date=November 14, 1978 |issn=0035-791X}}</ref>\n\nThe following week Ronstadt and Larson cut their vocals for Young's ''[[American Stars 'n Bars]]'' album at Young's [[La Honda, California|La Honda]] ranch \u2013 the two women were billed on the album as the Bullets \u2013 and, in November 1977, Young invited Larson to [[Nashville]] to sing on his ''[[Comes a Time]]'' album. This led to Larson's being signed to [[Warner Bros.

She also sang on [[the Doobie Brothers]]' ''[[Minute by Minute]]''. That album's producer, [[Ted Templeman]], then produced Larson's debut album, ''[[Nicolette (album)|Nicolette]]''.<ref name=larson>{{cite magazine |title=Music World Says Goodbye To Nicolette Larson |last=Cramer |first=Christina |magazine=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/music-world-says-goodbye-to-nicolette-larson-19971218 |date=December 18, 1997 |access-date=August 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== 1978\u20131983 ==\nLarson's work with Commander Cody had led to her being signed to the [[country music|C&W]] division of [[Warner Bros. Records]]. However her debut album ''[[Nicolette (album)|Nicolette]]'', released September 29, 1978, was an eclectic mix of rock, C&W and R&B.\n\nDespite the release of her album so late in the year, Larson was acclaimed Female Vocalist of 1978 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', which wrote no one else could sound as if she were having so much fun on an album. ''Nicolette'' reached No.&nbsp;15 on Billboard's album chart aided by the hit single \"[[Lotta Love]]\", a [[Neil Young]] composition. Larson's \"Lotta Love\" hit #1 on the Easy Listening/Adult Contemporary chart and went Top 10 Pop in February 1979. Linda Ronstadt, Valerie Carter, Bill Payne, James Burton, and [[Patrick Simmons]] performanced on ''[[Nicolette (album)|Nicolette]]'' album.<ref>[https://www.wincityvoices.org/art/music/jeffs-playlist-nicolette/ Nicolette] wincityvoices.org Retrieved 22 August 2024</ref> <!--the same week the single off(an Ian & Sylvia record with Larson uncredited on the single), debuted on the Hot 100 on its way to a No.&nbsp;61 peak. (\"Sail Away\", a track featuring Larson, from the ''Comes a Time'' sessions or was included on the otherwise live Neil Young album released in 1979-->\n\nWarner Brothers also issued the limited edition (5,000 copies) promo-only ''Live at the [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|Roxy]]'' album comprising a December 20, 1978, concert given by Larson at the [[Sunset Boulevard]] nightclub. Larson was also featured on the ''[[No Nukes (album)|No Nukes]]'' album recorded in September 1979 at [[Madison Square Garden]], backed by [[the Doobie Brothers]] in her performance of \"Lotta Love\".\n\nLarson would be unable to consolidate the commercial success augured by her debut: the second single off ''Nicolette'', \"Rhumba Girl\"<ref>\"Rhumba Girl\" was written by Jesse Winchester, who introduced it as \"Rhumba Man\" on his ''Nothing But a Breeze'' album. Although Larson had been a session singer on ''Nothing But a Breeze'' she had not sung on \"Rhumba Man\", first hearing the song at a live performance by Winchester.</ref> just missed becoming a major hit for Larson at No.&nbsp;48. Her second album, ''In the Nick of Time,'' released November 1979, failed to showcase Larson's voice attractively. Don Shewey in ''Rolling Stone'' wrote:<blockquote>Larson's rough-edged, down-home tone is definitely appealing \u2013 especially when she backs up the likes of Neil Young and [[Steve Goodman]] [whose ''High and Outside'' album featured a duet with Larson: \"The One That Got Away\"] \u2013 but as a soloist, her limited vocal resources are \"severely taxed\" \u2013 \"It's symptomatic of Nicolette Larson's problems as a performer that the finest singing on ''In the Nick of Time'' is by [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]]. 'Let Me Go, Love'&nbsp;... McDonald's entrancing vocal presence&nbsp;... so overshadows Larson's that she seems to be playing second fiddle rather than sharing the lead. Elsewhere, Larson is dwarfed by [[Ted Templeman]]'s typically luxurious production\".<ref name=\"larson\"/></blockquote>\n\nReleased as the album's lead single, \"Let Me Go Love\" reached only No.&nbsp;35 in February 1980. That year Larson was heard on the airwaves via guest appearances on \"Say You'll Be Mine\" by [[Christopher Cross]] and the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band|Dirt Band]]'s \"Make a Little Magic\". Larson had enough residual popularity from her debut for ''In the Nick of Time'' to become a moderate success. Because she had no major hit, Larson's 1981 and 1982 album releases, ''[[Radioland (album)|Radioland]]'' (her last album produced by Templeman) and ''[[All Dressed Up and No Place to Go]]'', were unsuccessful, even though both releases showed Larson back in strong vocal form. In 1982 Larson received some [[adult contemporary music|adult-contemporary]] radio airplay with her remake of \"[[I Only Want to Be With You]]\" (No. 53).<ref>[https://www.sessiondays.com/2022/04/1982-nicolette-larson-i-only-want-to-be-with-you-us53/ I Only Want to Be With You] sessiondays.com  Retrieved 22 August 2024</ref>\n\nLarson had continued her background singing career accruing credits on releases by [[Tom Johnston (musician)|Tom Johnston]], [[Linda Ronstadt]] (''[[Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)|Mad Love]]''), [[Graham Nash]], [[John Stewart (folk musician)|John Stewart]], [[Albert Hammond]], and [[Rita Coolidge]]. Larson again backed [[the Doobie Brothers]] on their ''[[One Step Closer (The Doobie Brothers album)|One Step Closer]]'' album; she can be heard on the hit \"Real Love.\" A song Larson co-wrote with [[John McFee]] and [[Patrick Simmons]] titled \"Can't Let It Get Away\" was a 1981 single release for the Doobie Brothers in [[Japan]]. <!--Larson contributed a harmony vocal on the track \"Could This Be Magic\" on the [[Van Halen]] album ''[[Women and Children First (album)|Women and Children First]]'' (1980), to thank [[Eddie Van Halen]] for playing guitar on the ''Nicolette'' album track \"Can't Get Away From You,\" against [[David Lee Roth]]'s wishes.-->\n\nLarson's recording of the [[Burt Bacharach]]/[[Carole Bayer Sager]] song \"Fool Me Again\" was featured on the bestselling soundtrack album for the 1981 film ''[[Arthur (1981 film)|Arthur]],'' despite not being heard in the film.

Larson's MCA debut ''[[...Say When]]'' was not released until 1985 (by which point country pop was no longer in style and [[neotraditional country|neotraditionalists]] had taken over the country scene). The C&W career it ushered in for Larson proved anticlimactic with only one of her six MCA single releases becoming a significant hit: her duet with [[Steve Wariner]] titled \"That's How You Know When Love's Right,\" taken from the April 1986 album release ''[[Rose of My Heart]].'' The record reached No.&nbsp;9 C&W. Larson's MCA albums, produced by [[Emory Gordy Jr.]] and [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]], attracted little critical attention. Her final mainstream album release was ''[[Shadows of Love]]'', a 1988 recording made for the Italian [[Compagnia Generale del Disco|CGD]] label and produced by Carlo Stretti and Ernesto Taberelli. It was her only album for a non-US label. \n\nIn 1992 Larson reunited professionally with [[Neil Young]] to sing on his ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'' album. In 1993 she was featured on Young's ''[[Unplugged (Neil Young album)|Unplugged]]''. <!--She also provided vocal accompaniment on \"The Little Drummer Boy\" and \"Greensleeves\", two of the tracks Young contributed to ''Seven Gates: A Christmas Album by [[Ben Keith]] and Friends'' (1994).-->Larson's final album was the self-produced ''Sleep, Baby, Sleep'', consisting of music for children, released by [[Sony Wonder]] in 1994.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/sleep-baby-sleep-mw0000247700 Sleep, Baby, Sleep] allmusic access-date=22 August 2024</ref>\n\nLarson also contributed to the seasonal albums ''Tennessee Christmas '' (1987) with \"One Bright Star\", ''Acoustic Christmas'' (1988) with \"Christmas Is a Time for Giving,\" and ''Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas'' (1989) with \"Nothing But a Child\" and \"One Bright Star\".

Larson and DeVito later married and divorced. She also dated Neil Young during the ''Comes a Time'' sessions. In the early 1980s, Larson was engaged to [[Andrew Gold]], but their relationship ended shortly after the completion of Larson's 1982 album ''All Dressed Up and No Place to Go,'' which Gold had produced.

During his career, LeDoux recorded 36 albums (many self-released), which have sold more than six million units in the United States as of January 2007. He was awarded two gold and one platinum album certifications from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]], and was honored with the [[Academy of Country Music]] Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award. LeDoux is also the only person to participate and also perform at the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]].\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early years===\nLeDoux was born in [[Biloxi, Mississippi]], on October 2, 1948. He was of [[French people|French]] descent on his father's side. His father was in the [[US Air Force]] and was stationed at Keesler Air Force Base at the time of his birth. The family moved often when he was a child, due to his father's Air Force career. He learned to ride horses while visiting his grandparents on their [[Wyoming]] farm.<ref name=\"cmt\"/> At age 13, LeDoux participated in his first rodeo, and before long was winning junior rodeo competitions.<ref name=\"huey\">{{cite web |last= Huey |first= Steve |title= Chris LeDoux |publisher= [[Allmusic]] |year= 2005 |url ={{BillboardURLbyName |artist=chris ledoux |bio=true}} |access-date= 2007-03-16}}</ref>\n\nLeDoux continued to compete in rodeo events and played football through his high-school years. When his family moved to [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], he attended [[Cheyenne Central High School]].  After twice winning the Wyoming State Rodeo Championship bareback riding title during high school, LeDoux earned a rodeo scholarship to [[Casper College]] in [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]]. During his junior year at [[Eastern New Mexico University]], LeDoux won the Intercollegiate National [[saddle bronc and bareback riding|bareback riding]] championship.<ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |title= Chris LeDoux Biography |publisher= [[Country Music Television]] |year= 2005 |url= http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/ledoux_chris/bio.jhtml |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111107135707/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/ledoux_chris/bio.jhtml |archive-date= November 7, 2011 |access-date= 2007-03-16 |url-status= dead}}</ref>\n\nLeDoux married Peggy Rhoads on January 4, 1972.

After recording his songs in a friend's basement, LeDoux \"began selling his tapes at rodeo events out of the back of his pickup truck\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Chris LeDoux - LeDoux Country - Discography |url=https://www.ledouxcountry.com/discography/ |website=www.ledouxcountry.com |access-date=April 11, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\nIn 1976, LeDoux won the world bareback riding championship at the [[National Finals Rodeo]] in [[Oklahoma City]].<ref name=\"huey\"/> Winning the championship gave LeDoux more credibility with music audiences, as he now had proof that the cowboy songs he wrote were authentic.<ref name=\"coon\">{{cite web |last= Coon |first= Chuck |title= Chris LeDoux: Missing Chris |publisher= ChrisLedoux.com |year= 2005 |url =http://www.chrisledoux.com/bio3.htm |access-date= 2007-03-16 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070309150925/http://chrisledoux.com/bio3.htm |archive-date= March 9, 2007}}</ref> LeDoux continued competing for the next four years. He retired in 1980.<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\n===Music career===\nWith his rodeo career at an end, LeDoux and his family settled on a ranch in [[Kaycee, Wyoming]]. LeDoux continued to write and record his songs, and began playing concerts.<ref name=\"huey\"/> His concerts were very popular, and often featured a [[mechanical bull]] (which he rode between songs) and fireworks.<ref name=\"coon\"/> By 1982, he had sold more than 250,000 copies of his albums, with little or no marketing.  By the end of the decade, he had self-released 22 albums.<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\nDespite offers from various record labels, LeDoux refused to sign a recording contract, instead choosing to retain his independence and control over his work while enjoying his regional following.  In 1989, however, he shot to national prominence when he was mentioned in [[Garth Brooks]]' top-10 country hit \"[[Much Too Young (To Feel This Damn Old)]]\". Capitalizing on the sudden attention, LeDoux signed a contract with [[Capitol Records]] subsidiary Liberty Records and released his first national album, ''[[Western Underground]]'', in 1991. His follow-up album, ''[[Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy]]'', was certified gold and reached the top 10. The [[Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy (song)|title track]], a duet with Brooks, became LeDoux's first and only top-10 country single, reaching number seven in 1992.<ref name=\"huey\"/> In concert, he ended the song by saying, \"Thanks, Garth!\"\n\nFor the 35th annual Grammy Awards in 1992, the single track \"Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy\" was nominated for Best Country Vocal Collaboration.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chris LeDoux |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/chris-ledoux |website=grammy.com |access-date=24 August 2017 |date=14 May 2017}}</ref> LeDoux and Brooks also received nominations from the [[Academy of Country Music]] for Vocal Duo of the Year and from the TNN/Music City News Country Awards for Vocal Collaboration of the Year.\n\nFor the next decade, LeDoux continued to record for Liberty. He released six additional records, including ''[[One Road Man]]'', which made the country top 40 in 1998.<ref name=\"huey\"/> Toward the end of his career, LeDoux began recording material written by other artists, which he attributed to the challenge of composing new lyrics.<ref name=\"coon\"/> With his 2000 release, ''Cowboy,'' he returned to his roots, re-recording many of his earliest songwriting creations.<ref name=\"huey\"/>\n\nThe RIAA certified two gold and one platinum recordings for LeDoux. On February 22, 1993, the single \"Whatcha Gonna Do with a Cowboy\" went gold. On June 2, 1997, the album ''The Best of Chris LeDoux'' went gold. And on October 5, 2005, the album ''20 Greatest Hits'' went platinum.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum - Chris LeDoux |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=chris+ledoux#search_section |website=RIAA |publisher=Recording Association of America}}</ref><ref name=\"remaster\" />\n\n===Illness and death===\nIn August 2000, LeDoux was diagnosed with [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], which required him to receive a [[liver]] transplant. [[Garth Brooks]] volunteered to donate part of his liver, but it was incompatible. An alternative donor was located, and LeDoux received a transplant on October 7, 2000.<ref name=\"gardner\">{{cite web |last= Gardner |first= Tom |title= Chris LeDoux Back After Transplant |publisher= PlanetGarth.Com |date= June 20, 2001 |url =http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=00547 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073947/http://www.planetgarth.com/news/article.php?cid=00547 |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |access-date= March 16, 2007}}</ref> After his recovery, he released two additional albums.

A good friend.\"\n\nGarth Brooks performed the song on the ''39th Annual CMA Awards'' on November 15, 2005, live from Times Square in New York City.  Later that evening, LeDoux was honored with the CMA Chairman's Award of Merit, presented by [[Kix Brooks]] of [[Brooks & Dunn]], to LeDoux's family.\n\nFriends have also collaborated to produce an annual rodeo, art show, and concert in Casper, Wyoming to honor LeDoux's memory.

They gained the attention of [[Chet Atkins]], who began to promote them for national attention.\n\nThey began writing and recording their own music in 1956, and their first hit song came in 1957, with \"[[Bye Bye Love (The Everly Brothers song)|Bye Bye Love]],\" written by [[Felice and Boudleaux Bryant]]. The song hit No. 1 in the spring of 1957, and additional hits would follow through 1958, many of them written by the Bryants, including \"[[Wake Up Little Susie]],\" \"[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]],\" and \"[[Problems (The Everly Brothers song)|Problems]].\" In 1960, they signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and recorded \"[[Cathy's Clown]],\" written by the brothers themselves, which was their biggest selling single. The brothers enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in 1961 and their output dropped off, though additional hit singles continued through 1962, with \"[[That's Old Fashioned (That's the Way Love Should Be)]]\" being their last top-10 hit.\n\nLong-simmering disputes with [[Wesley Rose]], the CEO of [[Acuff-Rose Music]], which managed the group, and increased drug use in the 1960s, as well as changing tastes in popular music, led to the duo's decline in popularity in its native U.S., though the brothers continued to release hit singles in the U.K. and Canada and had many highly successful tours throughout the 1960s. In the early 1970s, the brothers began releasing solo recordings, and in 1973 they officially broke up. Starting in 1983, the brothers got back together and continued to perform periodically until Phil's death in 2014. Don died seven years later.\n\nThe group had a major influence on the music of the generation that followed it. Many of the top acts of the 1960s were heavily influenced by the close-harmony singing and acoustic guitar playing of the Everly Brothers including [[the Beatles]], [[the Beach Boys]], the [[Bee Gees]], and [[Simon & Garfunkel]].

Rose was reportedly upset that the Everlys were recording a song which he had not published and, hence, for which he would not be paid any publishing royalties. Rose made efforts to block the record's release. The Everlys held firm to their position, and as a result, in the early 1960s, they were shut off from Acuff-Rose songwriters. These included Felice and Boudleaux Bryant, who had written and composed most of their hits, as well as the Everlys themselves, who were still contracted to Acuff-Rose as songwriters and had written several of their own hits. From 1961 through early 1964, the Everlys recorded songs by other composers to avoid paying any royalties to Acuff-Rose. They used the pseudonym \"Jimmy Howard\" as writer or arranger on two selections they wrote and recorded during this time. This ruse, however, was ultimately unsuccessful, as Acuff-Rose gained legal possession of the copyrights once the deception was discovered.<ref name=\"alca\">{{cite web|url=https://alancackett.com/phil-everly/|title=Phil Everly|website=Alan Cackett |access-date=September 15, 2021}}</ref>\nAround this time, the brothers also set up their own record label, Calliope Records, for solo projects. Using the pseudonym \"Adrian Kimberly\", Don recorded a big-band instrumental version of [[Edward Elgar]]'s first \"[[Pomp and Circumstance]]\" march, which [[Neal Hefti]] arranged and which charted in the United States top 40 in mid-1961. Further instrumental singles credited to Kimberly followed, but none of those charted. Phil formed the Keestone Family Singers, which featured [[Glen Campbell]] and [[Carole King]]. Their lone single, \"Melodrama\", failed to chart, and by the end of 1962, Calliope Records had gone out of business.\nThe Everly Brothers' last United States top 10 hit was 1962's \"That's Old Fashioned (That's The Way Love Should Be)\", a song recorded but unreleased by [[The Chordettes]] and given to the brothers by their old mentor, Archie Bleyer.<ref name=\"ebmf\"/>\n\nIn succeeding years the Everly Brothers sold fewer records in the United States. Their enlistments in the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] in October 1961 took them out of the spotlight.<ref>Natalie Best. \"Rock 'n' Roll Marine Weds With Brother As Best Man\".

Of their 27 singles on Warner Bros. from 1963 through 1970, only three made the [[Billboard Hot 100]], and none peaked higher than No.&nbsp;31. Album sales were also down.

The group was formed in 1972 by Terry Efaw and Steve Reis, who played together under the name Scotch & Soda. After adding songwriter, lead singer, and guitarist Bobby E. McNelley, they branded themselves McGuffey Lane, the location of Reis's [[Athens, Ohio]], home.\n\nThe band eventually expanded to a sextet and became well-known locally, releasing their first album on their own Paradise Island record label. The [[LP record|LP]] sold more than 40,000 copies,<ref name=amg>{{cite web|author=Sandra Brennan |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mcguffey-lane-mn0000397192/biography |title=McGuffey Lane &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2020-04-11}}</ref> and eventually resulted in their signing with [[Atco Records]]. They reissued the debut in 1980 and toured with the [[Charlie Daniels Band]], [[The Judds]], and the [[Allman Brothers Band]]. The follow-up, ''Aqua Dream'', featured the single \"Start It All Over\", which spent three weeks on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 97 in February 1982.<ref name=\"Hot 100 chart history\">{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/mcguffey-lane |title=McGuffey Lane &#124; Billboard |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2019-02-22 |archive-date=2019-02-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223094337/https://www.billboard.com/music/mcguffey-lane |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe group scored several minor hits on the country charts, but their label wanted to market them more as a pop-country act in the vein of [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]. They moved to [[Atlantic Records]] to focus more on country chart success, but as they prepared 1984's ''Day By Day'', keyboardist Tebes Douglass was killed in a [[car crash]]. Soon after, Bobby Gene McNelley left the group to pursue a solo career as a songwriter in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. In 1985, McGuffey Lane was dropped from Atlantic. In 1986, they released a [[Christmas]] album in support of the Central Ohio Lung Association; toward the end of that year, they inked a sponsorship with [[Miller Beer]], but a planned comeback fizzled.\n\nThe group played into the late 1980s but had dissolved by 1990. In 1995, they reunited after releasing a greatest hits album, and continued performing locally in Ohio into the 2000s. Two full-length releases followed the reunion, in 1998 and 2002. On August 18, 2009,  they opened for [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] at [[Lifestyle Communities Pavilion|The LC]] in Columbus, Ohio. In March 2010, Lick Records signed a distribution deal with E1 Entertainment, which allows the new McGuffey Lane album to be sold in [[Wal-Mart]] and [[Best Buy]].\n\n==Zachariah's Red Eye Reunion==\nEvery January, McGuffey Lane holds an annual reunion concert featuring many acts who also played at Zachariah's Red Eye Saloon. The first two reunions were held at Villa Milano Banquet and Conference Center, located on Schrock Road on the northeast side of Columbus, Ohio. After the initial two events, John Schwab (who is the organizer of the event) started looking for a larger venue to host the reunion concert, as it had outgrown Villa Milano. He settled on Lifestyles Communities Pavilion (now [[KEMBA Live!]]). The 2013 Reunion currently holds the indoor attendance record at the LC. The fourteenth anniversary took place on January 25, 2014.\n\nSome acts who have taken part in the event are: Rob McNelly (son of original lead singer Bobby Gene McNelly and current guitarist for [[Bob Seger and The Silver Bullet Band]]), John David Call (steel guitarist for [[Pure Prairie League]]), Steve Smith, Gary Ballen, Delyn Christian, Tom Ingham, the Dan Orr Project, Cliff Cody, Grassanine, and [[Erica Blinn]].\n\n==Members==\n*Terry Efaw \u2013 Steel guitar, gutstring guitar, electric guitar\n*Steve Reis \u2013 Bass, vocals\n*Molly Pauken- Mandolin, acoustic guitar,

The band relocated to [[Austin, Texas]] in October 1996.\n\n==History==\nLed by brothers Willy (vocals/guitar) and Cody Braun (vocals/fiddle/mandolin/harmonica), the alternative country-rock outfit Reckless Kelly formed in Stanley, Idaho in February 1996 before moving to Austin, Texas. The Brauns had previously toured with their father in Muzzie Braun & the Boys, a Western swing band, and were joined in their own group by the lead guitarist Casey Pollock, the bass guitarist Chris Schelske and the drummer Jay Nazz.\n\nWith their younger brothers Micky and Gary, Cody and Willy were raised in [[central Idaho]] near the [[Sawtooth Range (Idaho)|Sawtooth Mountains]], between [[Clayton, Idaho|Clayton]] and [[Challis, Idaho|Challis]] in [[Custer County, Idaho|Custer County]], and were homeschooled by their mother. Originally they were \"Muzzie Braun & the Little Braun Brothers\", as Muzzie and his brothers Gary and Billy were the \"Braun Brothers\" from [[Twin Falls, Idaho|Twin Falls]] in the 1970s and early 1980s, sons of the musician Eustaceus \"Mustie\" Braun.<ref name=bbhra>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eJVfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JDEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3614%2C1990319 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho)|last=McCarthy |first=John |title=Braun Brothers hit the road again for tour |date=June 22, 1990 |page=1D}}</ref><ref name=lntobitmmb81>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tJxfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tjEMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5698%2C1808942 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=(obituary) |title=Mustie and Marian Braun, former Lewiston residents |date=February 20, 1981 |page=5C}}</ref> From [[North Dakota]], Mustie was a neighbor and relative of the bandleader [[Lawrence Welk]], and was a keyboard player during the last days of legalized gambling in Idaho at [[Weiser, Idaho|Weiser]] in the early 1950s.

They turned Lucy's Retired Surfers Bar, a small bar and restaurant, into a noted music venue with their Monday night residency from November 1996 to May 1998. During this period, other music venues in Austin invited them to play, including the Continental Club, the Saxon Pub, [[Stubb's Bar-B-Q|Stubb's Barbecue]], and Antone's Home of the Blues.\n\nReckless Kelly's first album, ''[[Millican (album)|Millican]]'', appeared in fall 1997 and was officially released in 1998. ''[[Acoustic: Live at Stubb's]]'' and ''[[The Day (Reckless Kelly album)|The Day]]'' followed two years later, after which David Abeyta replaced Pollock on lead guitar. ''[[Under the Table and Above the Sun|Under the Table & Above the Sun]]'' in 2003 began the band's relationship with the high-profile Sugar Hill label and won the hearts of the music press and the honky tonkin' legend [[Joe Ely]], who sang the band's praises in interviews. ''[[Wicked Twisted Road]]'' was released in 2005, and the next year the live album ''[[Reckless Kelly Was Here]]'' captured the band's stage presence. ''[[Bulletproof (Reckless Kelly album)|Bulletproof]]'' was released in summer 2008 on a new label, [[Yep Roc Records]], and includes tracks critical of and reflecting on recent sociopolitical unfoldings, such as the [[Iraq War]] and [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In 2010, Reckless released an album of songs by one of their musical heroes, Pinto Bennett. ''[[Somewhere in Time (Reckless Kelly album)|Somewhere in Time]]'', in the band's own words, highlighted their love of \"straight-up honky tonk\". The band regularly returns to Austin to play before capacity crowds at venues like Nutty Brown Cafe & Amphitheatre.\n\nYounger brothers Micky and Gary Braun front their own band, [[Micky & The Motorcars]]. Both bands play at the annual Braun Brothers Reunion in Challis, Idaho, in August.\n\n==Discography==\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Billboard 200|US]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Millican (album)|Millican]]''\n|\n* Release date: July 7, 1998\n* Label: [[Cold Spring (label)|Cold Spring]]\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[The Day (Reckless Kelly album)|The Day]]''\n|\n* Release date: October 31, 2000\n* Label: [[Valley Entertainment]]\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Under the Table and Above the Sun|Under the Table & Above the Sun]]''\n|\n* Release date: May 13, 2003\n* Label: [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]]\n| 67\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Wicked Twisted Road]]''\n|\n* Release date: February 8, 2005\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n| 66\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Bulletproof (Reckless Kelly album)|Bulletproof]]''\n|\n* Release date: June 24, 2008\n* Label: [[Yep Roc Records]]\n| 22\n| 117\n| 2\n| 14\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Somewhere in Time (Reckless Kelly album)|Somewhere in Time]]''\n|\n* Release date: February 9, 2010\n* Label: Yep Roc Records\n| 22\n| 146\n| 2\n| 15\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Good Luck & True Love''\n|\n* Release date: September 13, 2011\n* Label: No Big Deal/Red Eye\n| 20\n| 78\n| \u2014\n| 18\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Long Night Moon''\n|\n* Release date: September 3, 2013\n* Label: No Big Deal/Red Eye\n| 22\n| 106\n| \u2014\n| 22\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Sunset Motel''\n|\n* Release date: September 23, 2016\n* Label: No Big Deal/Thirty Tigers\n| 12\n| 191\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''American Jackpot / American Girls''\n|\n* Release date: May 22, 2020 (Digital)\n* Release date: July 24, 2020 (CD)\n* Label: No Big Deal/Thirty Tigers\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Live albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"3\" | Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n! width=\"40\"| [[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Acoustic: Live at Stubb's]]''\n|\n* Release date: June 6, 2000\n* Label: Valley Entertainment\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Reckless Kelly Was Here]]''\n|\n* Release date: August 8, 2006\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n| 56\n| 41\n| 38\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n===Compilations ===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Best of the Sugar Hill Years (Reckless Kelly album)|Best of the Sugar Hill Years]]''\n|\n* Release date: July 10, 2007\n* Label: Sugar Hill Records\n|}\n\n===Music videos===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

His musical style has been described as a blend of [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]], and [[country music|country]]. He is the son of country musician [[Hank Williams]] and the father of musicians [[Holly Williams (musician)|Holly Williams]] and [[Hank Williams III]], and the grandfather of [[Coleman Williams]]. He is also the half brother of [[Jett Williams]].\n\nWilliams began his career following in his famed father's footsteps, covering his father's songs and imitating his father's style. Williams' first television appearance was in a December 1963 episode of ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', in which at age fourteen he sang several songs associated with his father. Later that year, he was a guest star on ''[[Shindig!]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0929947/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t130|title=Hank Williams, Jr.|publisher=[[IMDb]]|access-date=August 8, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs Williams struggled to define his own voice and place within the [[country music]] genre, his style began slowly to evolve.

Williams first stepped onto the stage and sang his father's songs when he was eight years old.\n\nHe attended [[John Overton High School]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where he would bring his guitar to music class and play for pep rallies and performances with the choir.\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1964, Williams made his recording debut with \"[[Long Gone Lonesome Blues]]\", one of his father's many classic songs.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944\u20132006, Second edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=388 |language=en |isbn=0823082911 }}</ref>\n\nHe provided the singing voice of his father<ref name=\"pc9\">{{Pop Chronicles |9 |4|Hank Williams Jr.}}</ref> in the 1964 film ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058765/ |title=Your Cheatin' Heart |date=December 1, 1964 |website=IMDb.com}}</ref> He also recorded an album of duets with recordings of his father.<ref name=\"pc9\" />\n\n===A change in appearance and musical direction===\nAlthough Williams' recordings earned him numerous country hits throughout the 1960s and early 1970s with his role as a \"Hank Williams impersonator\", he became disillusioned and severed ties with his mother.\n\nBy the mid-1970s Williams began to pursue a musical direction that would eventually make him a superstar. While recording a series of moderately successful songs, Williams began a pattern of heavy drug and alcohol abuse. Upon moving to [[Alabama]], in an attempt to refocus both his creative energy and his troubled personal life, Williams began playing music with [[Southern rock]] musicians including [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Toy Caldwell]], and [[Charlie Daniels]]. ''[[Hank Williams Jr. and Friends]]'' (1975), often considered his watershed album, was the product of these then-groundbreaking collaborations.\n\nOn August 8, 1975, Williams was nearly killed while mountain climbing in southwestern [[Montana]]. While climbing [[List of mountains in Beaverhead County, Montana|Ajax Peak]] on the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|continental divide]] ([[Idaho]] border) west of [[Jackson, Montana|Jackson]], the snow beneath Williams collapsed and he fell almost {{convert|500|ft}} onto rock, causing multiple severe skull and facial fractures.<ref name=singfll>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8R9OAAAAIBAJ&pg=1923%2C4536621 |work=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington) |agency=Associated Press |title=Singer injured in fall |date=August 11, 1975 |page=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-01-11-williams-miner-visit_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA | work=USA Today | title=Hank Williams visits W.Va. mine survivor | date=January 11, 2006}}</ref> Williams spent two years recovering, re-learning how to talk and sing, and undergoing 17 surgeries to repair his skull and reconstruct his face. The accident was chronicled in the semi-autobiographical, made-for-television film ''[[Living Proof: The Hank Williams Jr. Story]]''. To hide his scars and disfigurement from the accident, Williams grew a beard and began wearing sunglasses and a [[cowboy hat]]. The beard, hat, and sunglasses have since become Williams' [[trademark look|signature look]].{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\nIn 1977, Williams recorded and released ''One Night Stands'' and ''The New South'', and worked closely with his old friend Waylon Jennings on the song \"Once and For All\".{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} In 1980, he appeared on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' during Season 5, along with the Shake Russell-[[Dana Cooper]] Band.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}\n\n===Country music career===\n{{BLP sources section|date=October 2008}}\n[[File:HankWilliamsJrCollage-1000.jpg|thumb|upright=1.45|Williams performing at the Chumash Casino Resort in Santa Ynez, California, 2006]]\n\nIn 1976, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote that Williams' \"mainstream country material has always been among [[Nashville Tennessee|Nashville]]{{'}}s best\".<ref>{{Cite web| title = Hank Williams Jr.: Hank William Jr. and Friends.

''[[Family Tradition (album)|Family Tradition]]'', ''[[Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound (album)|Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound]]'', ''[[Habits Old and New]]'', ''[[Rowdy (Hank Williams, Jr. album)|Rowdy]]'', ''[[The Pressure Is On]]'', ''[[High Notes]]'', ''[[Strong Stuff]]'', ''[[Man of Steel (album)|Man of Steel]]'', ''[[Major Moves (album)|Major Moves]]'', ''[[Five-O (album)|Five-O]]'', ''[[Montana Cafe]]'', and many others resulted in a long string of hits.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1992, Williams released 21 albums\u201418 studio albums and three compilations\u2014that were all certified at least [[Music recording certification|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Between 1979 and 1990, he enjoyed a string of 30 Top Ten singles on the Billboard Country charts, including eight No.&nbsp;1 singles, for a total of 44 Top Ten singles, including a total of 10 No.&nbsp;1 singles, during his career.\n\nIn 1982, he had nine albums simultaneously on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, all of which were original works and not compilations. In 1987\u201388, Williams was named Entertainer of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]]. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, he won the same award from the [[Academy of Country Music]]. The pinnacle album of his acceptance and popularity was ''[[Born to Boogie (album)|Born to Boogie]]''.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Williams Jr. became a country music superstar known for catchy anthems and hard-edged, rock-influenced country. During the late 1970s and into the mid-1980s, Williams' songs constantly flew into the number one or number two spots, with songs such as \"Family Tradition\", \"Whiskey Bent and Hell Bound\", \"Old Habits\", \"Ain't Misbehavin{{'\"}}, \"[[Born to Boogie (song)|Born to Boogie]]\", and \"My Name Is Bocephus\".\n\nThe hit single \"[[Wild Streak]]\" (1987) was co-written by [[Houston]] native [[Terri Sharp]], for which Williams and Sharp both earned gold records. In 1988, he released a Southern pride song, \"[[If the South Woulda Won]]\". The reference is to a notional Southern victory in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nHis 1989 hit \"[[There's a Tear in My Beer]]\" was a duet with his father created using electronic merging technology. The song was written by his father, and had been previously recorded with Hank Williams playing the guitar as the sole instrument. The music video for the song combined existing television footage of Hank Williams performing, onto which electronic merging technology impressed the recordings of Williams, which then made it appear as if he were actually playing with his father. The video was both a critical and commercial success. It was named ''Video of the Year'' by both the Country Music Association and the Academy of Country Music. Williams would go on to win a [[Grammy Award]] in 1990 for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Vocal Collaboration]].\n\nHe is well known for his hit \"[[A Country Boy Can Survive]]\" and as the performer of the theme song for ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', based on his 1984 hit \"[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight]]\". In 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994, Williams' opening themes for ''Monday Night Football'' earned him four [[Emmy Award]]s. \n[[File:Hank Williams, Jr. (2006).jpg|thumb|Williams in 2006]]\nIn 2000, he provided the voice of Injun Joe in ''[[Tom Sawyer (2000 film)|Tom Sawyer]]''. In 2001, Williams Jr. co-wrote his classic hit \"A Country Boy Can Survive\" after 9/11, renaming it \"America Can Survive\". In 2004, Williams was featured prominently on ''CMT Outlaws''. In 2006, he starred at the Summerfest concert.\n\nHe has also made a cameo appearance along with [[Larry the Cable Guy]], [[Kid Rock]], and [[Charlie Daniels]] in [[Gretchen Wilson]]'s music video for the song \"[[All Jacked Up (song)|All Jacked Up]]\". He and Kid Rock also appeared in Wilson's \"[[Redneck Woman]]\" video. Hank also had a small part of Kid Rock's video \"Only God Knows Why\", and \"Redneck Paradise\".\n\nIn April 2009, Williams released a new single, \"Red, White & Pink-Slip Blues\", which peaked at number 43 on the country charts. The song was the lead-off single to Williams' album ''[[127 Rose Avenue]]''. The album debuted and peaked at number 7 on the ''Billboard'' Top Country Albums chart. Also in July 2009, ''127 Rose Avenue'' was announced as his last album for Curb Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725202808/http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1616664/hank-williams-jr-says-new-album-is-his-last-for-curb-records.jhtml|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 25, 2009|title=Hank Williams Jr. says new album is his last for Curb Records|last=Morris|first=Edward|work=[[Country Music Television]]|date=July 21, 2009|access-date=July 24, 2009}}</ref>\n\n== Musical style ==\nAs a multi-instrumentalist, Williams' repertoire of skills includes guitar, bass guitar, [[upright bass]], [[steel guitar]], [[banjo]], [[Resonator guitar]], piano, keyboards, saxophone, [[harmonica]], [[fiddle]], and drums.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Williams began his recording career performing covers of his father's songs.

I'm an NRA ([[National Rifle Association of America]]) member, a life member as a matter of fact. I'm more for the belief of making the punishment tougher for the criminals to start with.

Tritt stated that beginning in 1993, he was awakened \"regularly\" by disembodied voices in a vacation cabin that he owned \u2013 the voices spoke in an unknown dialect. His wife, Theresa, eventually heard them as well. According to Tritt, \"Over the years, these voices started happening\non such a frequent basis that we were afraid to come up here.\" He also asserted that footprints once appeared in the carpet of the cabin, and imprints in the bedspread, that belonged to neither him nor his wife.\n\nThe show's host, Kim Russo, concluded that an African-American medicine man had been stabbed and beaten to death on the property, and the voices that Tritt was hearing belonged to the murderers' angry spirits. A title card in the program notes that \"On August 14, 1875, a group of men killed a '[[Hoodoo (folk magic)|hoodoo]] doctor' close to the land where Travis' cabin was built.\" Russo believed that the hoodoo doctor's spirit also lingered on the property because it found a \"kindred spirit\" in Tritt.<ref>[http://www.mylifetime.com/shows/the-haunting-of/season-4/episode-9] {{dead link|date=September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3di96b|title=The Haunting Of S05E22 \u2013 Travis Tritt \u2013 video|website=Dailymotion.com|access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Travis Tritt discography}}\n'''Studio albums'''\n*''Proud of the Country'' (1987)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Travistritt/status/866469859089162242|title=It was released.

His parents separated when he was three. He was raised by his mother in Macon, and during the summer he spent time with his father in [[Homestead, Florida]]. He attended [[Windsor Academy]], a private Christian school in [[Bibb County, Georgia]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jason Aldean |url=https://waknights.com/our_team/jason-aldean/ |access-date=July 26, 2023 |website=Windsor Academy Knights}}</ref> Before his father went to his work, Aldean would map out guitar chords on notebook paper to show his son where to place his fingers to play the chords and Jason would sit and practice all day while his father was at work. When his father got home, he got out his own guitar and they played together. Soon he could play a song after hearing it only a few times. His early favorites included [[George Strait]]'s \"[[The Cowboy Rides Away (song)|The Cowboy Rides Away]]\", [[Hank Williams Jr.]]'s \"The Blues Man\", and [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]'s \"[[My Home's in Alabama (song)|My Home's in Alabama]]\".\n\nBoth of his parents encouraged young Aldean as he progressed musically. From age 14, after watching the country-music awards on television, he wanted to perform on stage. With his mother's help, he performed at the local VFW hall in Macon. He sang [[John Anderson (musician)|John Anderson]]'s song \"[[Seminole Wind (song)|Seminole Wind]]\" and [[Tracy Lawrence]]'s \"[[Sticks and Stones (Tracy Lawrence song)|Sticks and Stones]]\". He then began performing at area talent contests and local fairs. At 15, he joined the \"house band\" at Georgia nightspot Nashville South.\n\nIn order to stand out, Aldean changed the spelling of his middle name, Aldine, to come up with the name Aldean.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wycd.cbslocal.com/2015/01/20/10-country-stars-that-use-stage-names|title=10 Country Stars That Use Stage Names|date=January 20, 2015|access-date=June 28, 2015|archive-date=June 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630221330/http://wycd.cbslocal.com/2015/01/20/10-country-stars-that-use-stage-names/|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1998\u20132004: Career beginnings===\nAfter high school, with his father's help, Aldean and his band performed at clubs and festivals around the Southeast. With Justin Weaver (one of the band's members), Aldean began writing and recording original songs. In 1998, he performed songs from his first album at a showcase staged by [[Atlanta]] nightclub The Buckboard. He was approached by [[Michael Knox (record producer)|Michael Knox]], then of the [[Warner Chappell Music|Warner-Chappell]] song-publishing company.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p730273/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jason Aldean Biography |access-date=December 23, 2010 |last=Leggett |first=Steve |work=[[AllMusic|Allmusic]]}}</ref> After signing with Warner-Chappell, Aldean moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on November 1, 1998, at the age of 21.\n\nAldean was offered a recording contract but was subsequently dropped. He signed with another label but again was dropped in 2000 after his label postponed his recording sessions repeatedly. Various showcases failed to bring him a contract. The last straw was an attempt at the Wildhorse Saloon where the promised label talent scouts never showed up. Frustrated and discouraged with his struggling career, Aldean gave himself six months before planning to leave Nashville and return home to Georgia. Then five weeks later, he was offered a deal from [[BBR Music Group|Broken Bow Records]] in Nashville. Shortly after the release of [[Jason Aldean (album)|his self-titled debut album]], Aldean picked up his new (and current) agent Kevin Neal.

An earlier incarnation of this band was known as The Double Mountain Fork Of The Brazos River Boys.\n\n==History==\nIn 1972, Gilmore, Ely and Hancock, formed The Flatlanders with each contributing vocals, guitar, and songwriting skills. Other key musicians were Steve Wesson on [[autoharp]] and [[musical saw]], Tony Pearson on [[mandolin]] and backup harmony, [[Tommy Hancock]] (no relation to Butch Hancock) on [[fiddle]] and Syl Rice on [[string bass]].\n\nOne of the band's first appearances was at the [[Kerrville Folk Festival]] in 1972, where they were named one of the winners of the inaugural Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Singer/Songwriter Competition.\n\nThe band's first recording project was produced in 1972 by Shelby Singleton, the then-owner of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis, Tennessee's]] famed [[Sun Studios]]. A promotional single, Gilmore's \"Dallas\", was a commercial failure, and the planned album, ''All American Music'', was all but scrapped, being released only in a limited run on [[Stereo 8|8-track tape]] in order to fulfill contractual obligations. \n\nThe Flatlanders performed through 1973 before disbanding. By the end of the decade, however, Gilmore, Ely and Hancock had all found success as solo performers, and rumors of their earlier obscure collaboration began to circulate. In 1990, [[Rounder Records]] issued the 1972 sessions as ''More a Legend Than a Band''.\n\nThe three musicians continued to reunite for occasional Flatlanders performances. In 1998 they contributed to the soundtrack of ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'', and then in 2002 released their follow-up album, ''Now Again,'' on [[New West Records]].  In 2004 this was followed with ''Wheels of Fortune'', again on New West. In 2004, New West released ''Live '72'' a live recording of the then-unknown country band performing at the One Knite [[honky-tonk]] in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\nIn 2009, The Flatlanders released the album, ''Hills & Valleys''. In promotion of the album, the group appeared as musical guests on the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' on July 21, 2009, and on Garrison Keillor's ''A Prairie Home Companion'' on April 27, 2013.\n\nIn 2012, The Flatlanders released ''The Odessa Tapes'', an album composed of unreleased recordings culled from 1972 recording sessions.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Premiere: The Flatlanders, 'Shadow Of The Moon' |date=June 11, 2012 |url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/song-premiere-the-flatlanders-shadow-of-the-moon/ |publisher=America Songwriter |accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Flatlanders were voted into the Austin Music Awards Hall of Fame in March 2016. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/2016/03/16/country-band-the-flatlanders-inducted-into-austin-music-awards-hall-of-fame|title=Country band The Flatlanders inducted into Austin Music Awards Hall of Fame - The Daily Texan|website=Dailytexanonline.com}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"|Title\n!rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"|Details\n!colspan=\"4\"|Peak chart positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n!width=\"45\"|[[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n!width=\"45\"|[[Billboard 200|US]]\n!width=\"45\"|[[Top Heatseekers|US Heat]]\n!width=\"45\"|[[Independent Albums|US Indie]]\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''All American Music''{{ref label|double|a|}}\n| \n*Release date: 1973<ref name=discogs>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Flatlanders-One-Road-More/master/471581 |title=Flatlanders, The - One Road More |year=1973 |publisher=Discogs.com |accessdate=July 12, 2015}}</ref>\n*Label: [[Plantation Records]]\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''One Road More''{{ref label|double|a|}}\n| \n*Release date: 1980<ref name=discogs />\n*Label: [[Charly Records]]\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''More a Legend Than a Band''{{ref label|double|a|}}\n| \n*Release date: 1990<ref name=discogs />\n*Label: [[Rounder Records]]\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''Unplugged''{{ref label|double|a|}}\n| \n*Release date: 1995<ref name=discogs />\n*Label: [[Sun Records]]\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''Now Again''\n| \n*Release date: May 21, 2002\n*Label: [[New West Records]]\n|19\n|168\n|3\n|12\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''Wheels of Fortune''\n| \n*Release date: January 27, 2004\n*Label: New West Records\n|35\n|\u2014\n|17\n|17\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''Live '72''\n| \n*Release date: June 29, 2004\n*Label: New West Records\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''Hills and Valleys''\n| \n*Release date: March 31, 2009\n*Label: New West Records\n|38\n|\u2014\n|14\n|47\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''The Odessa Tapes''\n| \n*Release date: August 28, 2012\n*Label: New West Records\n|48\n|\u2014\n|19\n|\u2014\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|''Treasure of Love''\n| \n*Release date: July 9, 2021\n*Label: Rack 'Em Records\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|\u2014\n|-\n|colspan=\"6\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\na. {{note|double}} All four albums feature different combinations of the same set of tracks recorded in 1972.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.lubbock-lights.com ''Lubbock Lights'', a 2005 film starring The Flatlanders]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060220031051/http://www.happenstance-music.com/KFF_History.asp Kerrville Folk Festival New Folk Finalist History from Happenstance and Doug Coppock]\n*{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Garelick |work=[[The Boston Phoenix]] |title=The three troubadours: Joe Ely, Jimmie Dale Gilmore, and Butch Hancock keep the Flatlanders alive |url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/music/other_stories/documents/03604723.asp |date=February 20, 2004}}\n*{{cite news |first=Carolyn Pennypacker |last=Riggs |work=[[L.A.

In 2003 she entered [[Melodifestivalen 2003|Melodifestivalen]] for the second time with \"[[Crazy in Love (Jill Johnson song)|Crazy in Love]]\", which finished fourth in the final. She also hosted the final of [[Melodifestivalen 2005]]. Johnson is today one of the most successful artists in Sweden, with several Gold and Platinum records and since 2014 has hosted her own Swedish TV-show from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], ''[[Jills veranda]]''.\n\n==Biography==\n[[Image:Jill johnson lida country festival sweden 2003.jpg|thumb|right|Johnson in 2003]]{{BLP sources|date=March 2023}}\nJohnson is from the small town of [[\u00c4ngelholm]] in the south western part of Sweden. By the age of four, she had decided she wanted to become an artist, an aspiration towards which she was highly encouraged by her local choir leader. As a 12-year-old, she started off as the vocalist in a Country & Western band, Tomboola Band, touring in Norway and Denmark. She signed eventually with EMI-Medley in Denmark and recorded an album, produced by producer Paul Bruun. The title-track, \"Sugar Tree\", became a hit in [[Denmark]]. In 1996, she had her first Swedish hit with \"[[Kommer tid, kommer v\u00e5r]]\", a [[duet]] with [[Jan Johansen (singer)|Jan Johansen]].\n\nIn 1998, she performed \"K\u00e4rleken \u00e4r\" (\"Love is\") at national contest [[Melodifestivalen]], winning the Swedish finals and going on to represent Sweden in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. The success was followed by the hit album ''N\u00e4r hela v\u00e4rlden ser p\u00e5'' and a successful tour.\n\nIn mid-1999, Johnson went to Los Angeles to look for material for her second album. At home, she worked with [[Andreas Carlsson]] (ASCAP Writer of the Year 2000), who is known for several hits, including [[Celine Dion]]'s \"That's the Way It Is\". She also tried out a few local newcomers and the album ''Daughter of Eve'' was released in early 2000. It was very well received and Johnson was compared with some of the world's best artists.\n\nIn 2000, she received a Platinum-record in Denmark for the sound-track \"Promise To Love\" from the Danish block-buster, ''Eneste Ene''. Later that year, Johnson started to collaborate with other songwriters such as Jenny Orenstein, Charlie Stefl, Mary Green [Biem Writer of the Year 2001]. This resulted in her receiving a publishing contract in Nashville, Tennessee. Consequently, in 2002 Johnson's album entitled ''Good Girl'' came to be with the help of producer Scott Baggett and some of Nashville's top musicians. This album secured Johnson's artistic sound and style and once again she was extremely well received by the press in their reviews where she was described as an artist of international calibre.\n\nIn the Swedish finals of the Eurovision Song Contest 2003 she qualified at fourth place (out of 32 entries) but and her song \"Crazy in Love\" became a hit and received a great deal of radio play and was followed by a successful tour.\n\nJohnson's collective ''Discography'' CD was released in late March 2003. It contains the 20 most popular songs since her debut in 1995. The CD went straight into the sales charts for best selling CDs in Sweden. The single \"Crazy in Love\" stayed at No 1 in the Swedish Top Charts (Svensktoppen) 12 weeks consecutively and No 2 for 15 weeks. ''Discography'' sold Gold in Sweden and Johnson also got a [[Grammis]] for this album.\n\nThe album ''Roots and Wings'' was released in November 2003, recorded and produced by Amir Aly in Sweden and by Scott Baggett in Nashville, Tennessee. ''Roots and Wings'' sold Gold in less than two weeks and Platinum a few months later.\n\nThe album ''Being who you are'' was released in Sweden in late March 2005 and sold Gold in only a few weeks.\n\nJohnson was the host of the 2005 Swedish finals of the Eurovision Song Contest in Stockholm. In 2014 she became the hostess of her own Swedish musical TV-series, ''[[Jills veranda]]'', where she brought together and performed with different Swedish and American music personalities in Nashville, the city where she also spends much time working with her own music. In 2014, she was awarded with the Swedish Kristallen-prize for \"Female host of the year\", due to [[Jills veranda]]. The show aired two following seasons in 2015 and 2017. In 2016 she participated in the popular musical TV-series ''[[S\u00e5 mycket b\u00e4ttre]]'', which was broadcast on [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]].\n\nIn 2019, Jill released the single \"Is It Hard Being A Man?\" among others which topped the Swedish radio charts.

He is the son of [[Country music|country]] singers [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Jessi Colter]]. In a career spanning three decades, Jennings has explored a variety of musical genres.\n\nJennings made his debut with the single \"4th of July\" of his 2005 album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' on [[Universal South Records|Universal South]], which peaked at No. 22 on the Billboard country charts.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Shooter Jennings - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/279176/shooter-jennings/chart?f=320|website = www.billboard.com|access-date = November 21, 2015}}</ref> Jennings has since followed with seven full-length studio albums: ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' (2006), ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' (2007), ''[[Black Ribbons]]'' (2009), ''Family Man'' (2012), ''The Other Life'' (2013) ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'' (2016), and ''Shooter'' (2018), in addition to a live album, a compilation, and numerous [[Extended play|EPs]].\n\n== Early life ==\nJennings was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], on May 19, 1979. There are two different accounts regarding how he got his nickname \"Shooter.\" His mother cited her, and husband Waylon Jennings', love of western culture and cowboy art for inspiring the gun-derived moniker. But his father said he came up with the name when, moments after the newborn emerged from his mother's womb, the boy sprayed a nurse before anyone could put on his first diaper. \"I love my mom,\" says Jennings, \"but I like Dad's version better. And I believe it's true. He didn't make [stuff] like that up.\"\n\nHe lived the first few years of his life in a crib on his parents' tour bus surrounded by the likes of [[Johnny Cash]], [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Kris Kristofferson]]. By age 5, he was playing drums. At 8 years old, he began taking piano lessons. He started playing guitar at 14 and on occasion he'd play percussion in his father's band.\n\nIn high school Jennings fronted an industrial rock band called KilRaven for his high school's talent show. In 2011, he released the KilRaven track \"Only You\" on the album \"Missed The Boat\".\n\nIn 1996, Jennings and his father recorded an album together. They called it ''Fenixon'' (a play on the words \"phoenix\" and \"son\") but could not find a label to distribute it.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Waylon and Son, Reunited on Disc|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122471459623460261|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = November 21, 2015|issn = 0099-9660|first = Jim|last = Fusilli}}</ref> Some of the material was remastered and used for the album ''Waylon Forever''. The full ''Fenixon'' recording was finally released by Jennings' label Black Country Rock in 2014. Shooter Jennings is the uncle of William Harness, Professionally known as [[Struggle Jennings]].\n\n== Career ==\n[[File:Shooterjennings(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|Jennings performing in 2009]]\n\n=== Stargunn ===\nIn 2001, Jennings left [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to seek his fortunes in [[Los Angeles]]. He assembled and performed with Stargunn, a [[rock music|rock]] band. The band featured Jennings on piano and lead vocals, Carter Falco, and Jonathan Boddie (later succeeded by Kevin Sciou) on guitar and background vocals, Curtis Roach on bass, and Lex Lipsitz on drums. Towards the end of 2001, Stargunn released their first album, ''The Only Way Up Is Down'', and toured with [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]], [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], Mark Ford and others in support of the album. That same year, ''[[Music Connection]]'' magazine listed Stargunn as one of the Hot 100 Unsigned Artists of 2001.\n\nIn 2002, Stargunn was featured on ''I've Always Been Crazy: A Tribute to Waylon Jennings'', and the soundtrack to the [[Vince Vaughn]] film ''[[Made (2001 film)|Made]]''. Shortly after, [[Touchstone Pictures]] licensed the song \"White Lines N Black Ties\" for the film ''[[The Crew (2000 film)|The Crew]]'' starring [[Burt Reynolds]]. Stargunn performed together for three years, built an avid following, and earned praise from the local music press. On March 30, 2003, Jennings dissolved Stargunn and began working on his solo career.\n\nAfter the band's breakup, Jennings was twice presented with the opportunity to front the hard rock supergroup [[Velvet Revolver]], but chose instead to pursue a solo career.<ref>{{Cite web|title = SHOOTER JENNINGS Claims He Was Offered VELVET REVOLVER Job Twice|url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/shooter-jennings-claims-he-was-offered-velvet-revolver-job-twice/|website = BLABBERMOUTH.NET|date = March 19, 2009|access-date = November 21, 2015|language = en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Jennings' label Black Country Rock released Stargunn's debut album \"The Only Way Up Is Down\" on vinyl as part of Record Store Day.\n\n=== ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'' ===\nHe returned to Los Angeles in 2004 to begin working on new material. In 2005 Jennings signed his first recording contract, with [[Universal South Records]], releasing his debut album ''[[Put the \"O\" Back in Country]]'' that same year.\n\n\"Put the \"O\" Back in Country\" produced his only entry on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts in its lead-off single \"Fourth of July\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;22. The album version of this song features a cameo appearance by George Jones, who sings the chorus to his signature song \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" at the end; this guest appearance was removed from the song's radio edit. Despite the edit, Jones was credited on the Billboard charts. The album featured his new band The .357's, which consisted of Leroy Powell on guitar, Bryan Keeling on drums, [[Ted Russell Kamp|Ted Kamp]] on bass with [[Robby Turner]] on steel, and backing vocals by [[Bonnie Bramlett]].\n\nLater that year his song \"Busted In Baylor County\" was then featured in the 2005 film version of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'', furthermore Jennings portrayed his father in the [[Johnny Cash]] [[Biographical film|biopic]] ''[[Walk the Line]]'' alongside [[Joaquin Phoenix]] and [[Reese Witherspoon]]. His rendition of his father's song \"Long Way From Home\" was featured on the film's soundtrack.\n\n=== ''Electric Rodeo'' and ''The Wolf'' ===\nThough recorded before ''Put the \"O\" Back in Country'', released on April 4, 2006,{{clarify|reason=is this the release date of Put the O Back in Country or the release date of Electric Rodeo?|date=April 2017}} ''[[Electric Rodeo (Shooter Jennings album)|Electric Rodeo]]'' was released as Jennings's second solo album. Sonically, ''Electric Rodeo'' is louder, rawer, more upfront rock and roll than its predecessor.\n\n''Electric Rodeo'' was followed by ''[[The Wolf (Shooter Jennings album)|The Wolf]]'' on October 23, 2007. The album varied from his previous records in that the .357s had opted for a decidedly 1970s feel to the instrumentals. It featured collaborations with [[Doug Kershaw]] and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], as well as a cover of the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Walk of Life]]\".\n\nThat same year Jennings was featured on a duet of \"[[Good Hearted Woman (song)|Good Hearted Woman]]\" on [[Deana Carter]]'s sixth studio album, ''[[The Chain (Deana Carter album)|The Chain]]''.\n\n=== Departure from Universal ===\nIn 2009, Jennings, having issues with his label and wanting out of his four-album contract released his first compilation album, ''[[Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's]]''. The album featured four new tracks; live versions of \"Lonesome Blues\", and \"Daddy's Farm\", as well as covers of his father's \"Lonesome, Onry and Mean\", and the [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] song \"Living Proof\".\n\nAfter the release of ''Bad Magick: The Best of Shooter Jennings and the .357's'', having fulfilled his four-album contract; Jennings parted ways with Universal records.\n\nOn March 23, 2009, Jennings took part in ''[[CMT Crossroads]]'', a television show in which two musicians are paired with one another and perform a small concert together for an intimate crowd. The episode paired Jennings with close friend and fellow musician [[Jamey Johnson]]. The evening's set list consisted entirely of duets, including a cover of \"[[Outlaw country|Outlaw]] Shit\" from the ''[[Waylon Forever]]'' album, two songs from Jennings' discography; \"God Bless Alabama\", \"It Ain't Easy\". As well as four songs from Johnson's album ''[[That Lonesome Song]]''; \"High Cost Of Living\", \"Mowing Down The Roses\", \"Between Jennings and Jones\" and \"In Color\".\n\n=== ''Black Ribbons'' ===\nHaving left Universal, Jennings changed the name of his backing band from The .357's to Hierophant. With the news that he and his band would be joining the likes of [[Paramore]], [[Bad Religion]], [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Jefree Star]], and various other popular rock bands on the 2009 [[Warped Tour]] it became apparent that Jennings next album would differ drastically from his previous efforts.\n\nIn February 2009, it was announced that the album would be titled ''[[Black Ribbons]]''. It was also announced that it would be a dystopian concept rock opera and that writer [[Stephen King]] would play a major role in the album as Will O' The Wisp.\n\nIt was released independently on March 2, 2010, through Black Country Rock Records, and although it was seen as a complete departure from his country sound, the album showed off the diversity as an artist and gained him much critical acclaim, as well as a brand new underground following.\n\nOn May 1, 2010, Jennings announced \"Black Ribbons: The Living Album\" on his Twitter account.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ShooterJennings |title=Shooter Jennings (ShooterJennings) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=June 3, 2014 |access-date=August 4, 2014}}</ref> The \"Living Album\" includes the full studio record and live shows with [[Hierophant]] on a [[USB flash drive]] shaped like a tarot card.\nTowards the end of 2010, Jennings with the help of various other artists launched the \"XXX\" movement to help musicians who struggle to receive mainstream recognition.\n\nIn 2016, Jennings created and released a podcast series title \"Beyond the Black\" dealing with the topics and recording of [[Black Ribbons]]. The series is available on all music streaming formats as well as YouTube and the podcast's own website: [http://www.beyondthe.black www.beyondthe.black]\n\n=== ''Family Man'' ===\nIn 2011, along with childhood friend and master pianist Erik Deutsch, Jennings formed The Triple Crown, a new backing band featuring Erik Deutsch on piano, Tony Leone on drums, Jeff Hill on bass, Jon Graboff on pedal steel, Eleanor Whitmore on fiddle and Chris Masterson on lead guitar.\n\nOn March 13, 2012, having signed a record deal with [[E1 Music]], and with The Triple Crown along for the ride, Jennings returned to his country roots with the release of the album ''Family Man'', his first self-produced outing. The album was originally meant to contain eighteen tracks, but was instead split into two albums: ''Family Man'' and 2013's ''The Other Life''.\n\nOn July 31, 2012, Jennings was featured in [[Bucky Covington]]'s debut single \"The Drinking Side of Country\" from the album ''Good Guys''.\n\nJennings took part in the February 25 Johnny Cash 80th Birthday Bash, in which he sang [[Cocaine Blues]] With [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Amy Nelson]]. The performance was released in a DVD/CD combo.\n\nIn October 2012 Jennings was one of six commentators for the Ovation mini-series ''Song By Song: Johnny Cash''.\n\n=== ''The Other Life'' ===\nWhile recording ''Family Man'', Jennings decided to cut the darker tracks from the album, and instead use them for the album's follow-up, ''The Other Life''.\n\n\"Five of these songs were recorded when we were doing ''Family Man'', and when we were deciding what to do with it we broke it up into two records. ''The Other Life'' is representative of the other side of the coin from ''Family Man'' and the way my life has been going in a lot of ways, At first we were going to call it ''The Outsider'', but once we got into the film we thought, 'Well, it's like a mirror, a dark mirror of what ''Family Man'' was.{{'\"}} - Jennings told TheBoot.com.\n\nJennings premiered the track \"Wild & Lonesome\" (featuring [[Patti Griffin]]) on the 4th season of the FX original series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]''. Followed by the release of first official single from the album \"The White Trash Song\" (featuring [[Scott H. Biram]]) which premiered on RollingStones.com along with the announcement that the album would be accompanied by a film.\n\nThe album featured seven new songs, as well as two cover songs ([[Harry Nilsson]]'s \"Flying Saucer song\" and [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]]'s \"The White Trash song\") and \"Outlaw You\", which was put out in early 2012 as a digital release.\n\nJennings along with filmmaker Blake Judd released ''The Other Life'' film. Running at 32 minutes long, it utilizes six of the songs from the album as a sort of narration. The film is about a musician leaving his family to tour, but when he does so he finds the road is not the same, and becomes haunted by a mysterious woman. Throughout the film, the musician is forced to face his darker urges and deal with self-discovery, temptation, isolation and rebirth. The film closes with a short adaptation of [[Stephen King]]'s ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]''.\n\nThe Other Life went on to win Best Short Film at the 2013 Horror Hound Festival.\n\nThe album was also heavily featured in the 2nd season of ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]'', of which Shooter also appears, as himself.\n\n=== Black Country Rock Media ===\n{{main|Black Country Rock Media}}\nIn October 2013, Jennings announced the formation of his new label and multi-format recording company, Black Country Rock. Their initial releases included: a remastered release of the [[Waylon Jennings]] album ''[[Right for the Time]]'', two live albums (one from [[Jessi Colter]] titled ''Live from Cain's Ballroom'', and one from Jennings titled ''The Other Live''), as well as a recording of \"[[You Are My Sunshine]]\" featuring vocals from both [[Jamey Johnson]] and Jennings. All four were released on vinyl, cassette, CD, as well as digitally.\n\n=== ''The Magic'' ===\nOn February 27, 2014, Jennings revealed he would be releasing a spoken word follow-up to Hierophant's 2010 album, ''[[Black Ribbons]]'', titled ''The Magic'', inspired by first story in the controversially interactive horror series thirteen.\n\nIn addition to ''The Magic'' Jennings also announced, that after nearly a decade of waiting, he would be releasing the 1995 collaborative album, ''Fenixon''.\n\nBoth projects were released during 2014's Record Store Day, and subsequently sold out.\n\n=== \"George/Giorgio\" releases ===\nTowards the end of May 2014, Jennings announced his intention to release two EP's later in the year. ''Don't Wait Up (for George)'' is a tribute to his close friend and mentor [[George Jones]], which was released in August 2014. Jennings' seventh studio album, ''[[Countach (For Giorgio)]]'', was originally scheduled to be released in November 2014, but its release was delayed due to the sudden death of [[Jon Hensley (radio personality)|Jon Hensley]], Jennings' longtime manager and friend and Black Country Rock co-founder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/how-daft-punk-and-the-muppets-inspired-shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-6616503 |title=How Daft Punk and the Muppets Inspired Shooter Jennings' Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album |first=Daniel |last=Kohn |work=[[LA Weekly]] |publisher=[[Voice Media Group]] |date=February 23, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> A tribute to 1970s electronic-music pioneer and producer, [[Giorgio Moroder]], the album was released on February 26, 2016, and features guest vocals from [[Steve Young (musician)|Steve Young]],<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6882805/shooter-jennings-giorgio-moroder-tribute-album-countach-david-bowie-interview |title=Shooter Jennings on Giorgio Moroder Tribute Album & How His David Bowie Cover 'Ended Up Meaning So Much More' |first=Chuck |last=Dauphin |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |date=February 19, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Brandi Carlile]],<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/shooter-jennings-enlists-marilyn-manson-brandi-carlile-for-countach-20160104 |title=Shooter Jennings Enlists Marilyn Manson, Brandi Carlile for 'Countach' |first=Andrew |last=Leahey |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=January 4, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> [[Marilyn Manson]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2016/02/marilyn-manson-covers-the-hell-out-of-david-bowies-cat-people-listen/ |title=Marilyn Manson covers the hell out of David Bowie's \"Cat People\" \u2014 listen |first=Ben |last=Kaye |work=[[Consequence of Sound]] |date=February 18, 2016 |access-date=March 2, 2016}}</ref> and [[Richard Garriott|Richard Garriott de Cayeux]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/neon-noir-meets-outlaw-country-shooter-jennings-tr-230314 |title=Neon noir meets outlaw country in Shooter Jennings' tribute to Giorgio Moroder |first=Mike |last=Vanderbilt |work=[[The A.V.

Together with [[Dave Cobb]], Jennings produced her 2018 album ''[[By the Way, I Forgive You]]'', which landed six Grammy nominations, including the all-genre Album and Song of the Year categories. It won in three categories: Americana album and both best American roots song and best American roots performance (for \"The Joke\").\n\nAfter reuniting with Dave Cobb, with whom Jennings made his first four records, Jennings, inspired by the 1984 country album ''[[Major Moves]]'' decided to shelve the album he had already been working on and instead go in a completely different direction with Cobb and make a fun, straight-ahead drinking, rockin' record. That album, titled ''Shooter'', was released in August 2018. \n \nThe following year Jennings teamed up with Brandi Carlile to produce [[Tanya Tucker]]'s 25th album, ''[[While I'm Livin']]''. The record, Tucker's first in 17 years, earned Grammys for Best Country Album and Best Country Song as well as Americana Award nominations for Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Artist of the Year.\n\n=== ''Over a Cocaine Rainbow'' ===\n\nIn late 2021 Jennings released \"Leave Those Memories Alone\", a tribute to his late friend and manager, Col. John Hensley. the track serves as the first single from the album ''Over a Cocaine Rainbow''. The record was initially slated for a 2017 release, but Jennings felt it was too \"dark and experimental\" to release at the time, given its subject matter and tone. Earlier that same year, Jennings released a remix of his \"From Here to Eternity\" track. The new version is dubbed the \"Goof the Floof Remix\", a reference to something Scientology founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] once said in an interview.\n\n=== Radio show ===\n\nSince 2005, Jennings has hosted \"Shooter Jennings' Electric Rodeo\" on [[Sirius XM]] Outlaw Country channel.<ref>{{cite web|title=SHOOTER JENNINGS DJS ON SIRIUS RADIO|url=http://www.countryweekly.com/news/shooter-jennings-djs-sirius-radio|website=Country Weekly|access-date=November 13, 2015}}</ref> The show's format primarily consists of country, rock, and outlaw music.

After serving as a backing band for [[outlaw country]] acts [[David Allan Coe]] and [[Johnny Paycheck]], the band signed to a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]], releasing their self-titled debut album that year. In the 1990s, they released four more albums for Atlantic.\n\nConfederate Railroad has released six studio albums. In addition, 18 of their singles have entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.\n\nThe band's most recent studio album, ''Lucky to Be Alive'', was issued on the D&B Masterworks label on July 15, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/life/entertainment/story/2016/jul/15/not-ready-retire-work-just-keeps-coming-confe/375866/|title=Hixson's Danny Shirley and the Confederate Railroad still in demand 40 years after his professional debut|date=15 July 2016 |access-date=2016-08-05}}</ref> The band released their first live album, ''Confederate Railroad Live: Back to the Barrooms'', on the [[Koch Entertainment|E1 Music]] label on June 15, 2010.\n\n==History==\nConfederate Railroad was founded in 1987 by [[Danny Shirley]], Michael Lamb, Gates Nichols (May 26, 1944 \u2013 August 14, 2009),<ref name=obit1/> Chris McDaniel, Wayne Secrest (April 29, 1950 \u2013 June 2, 2018),<ref name=obit2/> and Mark Dufresne.

Released in 1994, it was certified platinum as well. The album was led off by the no.&nbsp;9 \"[[Daddy Never Was the Cadillac Kind]],\" followed by the no.&nbsp;20 \"Elvis and Andy,\" and finally \"Summer in Dixie,\" which failed to make Top 40. Also in 1994, Shirley and [[Mark Collie]] co-wrote and sang guest vocals on [[Billy Ray Cyrus]]'s \"Redneck Heaven,\" an album cut from his 1994 disc ''[[Storm in the Heartland]]''.<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=Storm in the Heartland |others=Billy Ray Cyrus |year=1994 |type=CD booklet |publisher=Mercury Records |id=314-526 081-2}}</ref>\n\nOne year later, the band released its third album, 1995's ''[[When and Where]]''. This album failed to sell as well as its predecessors, and was less successful on the charts as well. Lead-off single \"When and Where\" reached No.&nbsp;24, while the other three singles \u2013 \"Bill's Laundromat, Bar and Grill,\" \"When He Was My Age,\" and \"See Ya\" all failed to reach Top 40. A ''[[Greatest Hits (Confederate Railroad album)|Greatest Hits]]'' package followed in 1996.\n\nIn 1998, the band released its fourth and final studio album for Atlantic, titled ''Keep on Rockin'''. Its only two singles were \"The Big One\" and \"Cowboy Cadillac,\" both of which failed to reach the Top 60 on the country singles charts. After another compilation titled ''Rockin' Country Party Pack'' (which produced another chart single in \"Toss a Little Bone,\" previously from ''When and Where''), the band exited Atlantic.\n\nOne year later, Confederate Railroad signed to Audium/Koch Records (now [[E1 Music]]) for its fifth studio album, ''Unleashed''. It was led off by the no.&nbsp;39 \"What Brothers Do.\" Although this was the band's first Top 40 country hit since \"When and Where\" in 1995, the other singles \u2013 \"She Treats Her Body Like a Temple\" and \"White Trash with Money\" \u2013 both failed to reach Top 40.\n\nThe band did not record again until 2007's ''Cheap Thrills'', an album of [[cover song]]s. This album was led off by a cover of \"[[Please Come to Boston]],\" which failed to chart.\n\nConfederate Railroad members signed a record deal with E1 Music in 2010 and released their first-ever live album called \"Confederate Railroad Live: Back to the Barrooms.\" Cody McCarver of Confederate Railroad also signed to the label and has recently had success{{vague|date=April 2020}} with Confederate Railroad's song \"White Trash with Money\" which was written by Confederate Railroad's Danny Shirley with songwriter Buck Moore. The video by Cody also featured Jimmy Dormire who left Confederate Railroad in 2008. Cody McCarver released a single and video called \"I'm America.\"\n\nSince 2019, the band has missed bookings and had concerts cancelled because of concerns over the band's name and their logo's inclusion of two [[Confederate flag]]s. In cancelling their planned performance at the [[Ulster County, New York#Recreation|Ulster County Fair]], organizers said the event must represent \"the values of all members of our community\" and that \"showcasing of a symbol of division and racism runs counter to that principle.\"\n\nCritics say that the Confederate flag is a racist symbol, representing a [[United States Civil War|war to continue slavery]] and [[racial segregation in the United States]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kaur |first=Harmeet |url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/entertainment/confederate-railroad-name-backlash-trnd/index.html |title=Confederate Railroad says it won't change its name |publisher=CNN |date=2019-08-01 |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> The band said the cancellation was \"very disappointing\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confederaterailroad.com/press-release.htm |title=Press release |publisher=Confederate Railroad |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> Shirley says the flag represents history and Southern heritage.<ref>{{cite web|agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.sj-r.com/news/20190725/country-band-confederate-railroad-nixed-from-another-fair |title=Country band Confederate Railroad nixed from another fair - News - The State Journal-Register - Springfield, IL |publisher=Sj-r.com |date=2019-07-25 |access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\nShirley blamed [[J.
