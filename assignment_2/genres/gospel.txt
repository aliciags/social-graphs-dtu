With her mother's help, she and her siblings formed the Singing McEntires, which played at local events and recorded for a small label. McEntire later enrolled at [[Southeastern Oklahoma State University]] and studied to become a public school teacher. She also continued to occasionally perform and was heard singing at a rodeo event by country performer [[Red Steagall]]. Drawn to her singing voice, Steagall helped McEntire secure a country music recording contract with [[PolyGram]]/[[Mercury Records]] in 1975. In that year, she relocated with her mother to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\nOver the next several years, PolyGram/Mercury released a series of McEntire's albums and singles, which amounted to little success. In the early 1980s McEntire's music gained more momentum through several top ten country songs, including \"[[(You Lift Me) Up to Heaven]]\", \"[[I'm Not That Lonely Yet]]\", and her first number one \"[[Can't Even Get the Blues]]\". Yet McEntire became increasingly unhappy with her career trajectory and signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1984. Her second MCA album titled ''[[My Kind of Country (Reba McEntire album)|My Kind of Country]]'' (1984) became her breakout release, spawning two number one ''Billboard'' country singles and pointed toward a more traditional musical style. Through the 1980s McEntire released seven more studio albums and had ten more number one country hits. Her number one singles included \"[[One Promise Too Late]]\", \"[[The Last One to Know (song)|The Last One to Know]]\", and the [[Grammy Award]]-winning \"[[Whoever's in New England (song)|Whoever's in New England]]\".\n\nIn 1991, McEntire lost eight of her band members in a plane crash in [[San Diego]], California. The experience led to McEntire's critically acclaimed album ''[[For My Broken Heart]]'', which is her highest-selling album to date. She followed it with several commercially successful albums during the 1990s, including ''[[Read My Mind (album)|Read My Mind]]'' (1994), ''[[What If It's You]]'' (1996), and ''[[If You See Him]]'' (1998). These albums featured the number one country singles \"[[The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (song)|The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter]]\", \"[[How Was I to Know (Reba McEntire song)|How Was I to Know]]\", and a duet with [[Brooks and Dunn]] called \"[[If You See Him/If You See Her]]\". McEntire's acting career began in January 1990 when she made her film debut in ''[[Tremors (1990 film)|Tremors]]''. In 2001, she played the role of [[Annie Oakley]] in the Broadway musical ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]''. In the same year [[The WB]] launched the TV series ''[[Reba (TV series)|Reba]]'', in which she starred. More recently, she has guest-starred on ''[[Young Sheldon]]'' as June Ballard. Since 2023, McEntire has been featured as a coach on ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nMcEntire was born in [[McAlester, Oklahoma]], in 1955<ref name=\"allmusicbio\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1724|pure_url=yes}} |title=Reba McEntire&nbsp;\u2013 Biography |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=October 22, 2021}}</ref> but was raised on a ranch in [[Chockie, Oklahoma]].<ref name=\"Hall of Fame\">{{cite web |title=Reba McEntire: Artist Bio |url=https://countrymusichalloffame.org/artist/reba-mcentire/ |website=[[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum]] |access-date=October 22, 2021}}</ref><ref name=\"Fort Worth\">{{cite news |last=Koop |first=Chacour |title=A rival for Rocky?

He had 19 top-10 solo hits on the country music charts from 1977 through 1990.

Gosdin and two brothers sang gospel on [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] radio station [[WJOX (AM)|WVOK]].<ref name=\"jw1-575\"/> Gosdin later moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], where he operated the D&G Tap. He idolized [[The Louvin Brothers]] and [[The Blue Sky Boys]] as a young man.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\n===1960s: West Coast Country music movement===\nIn 1961, Gosdin moved to California, where he joined the West Coast Country music movement, first as a member of the Golden State Boys,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which became [[The Hillmen]], and included [[Chris Hillman]].<ref name=\"jw1-575\"/> Gosdin then formed The Gosdin Brothers with brother Rex. The duo appeared on the charts in the late 1960s with a song titled \"Hangin' On\" on the Bakersfield International label, then with \"Till The End\" on Capitol Records. During the same time period, the Gosdin Brothers were featured on Hillman's former [[Byrds]] mate [[Gene Clark]]'s first solo album, the 1967 well-regarded ''[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]'',<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> singing backing vocals on all of the tracks behind the lead vocals of Clark and lead guitars of Clarence White, Glen Campbell, and Bill Rinehart (later of the Merry-Go-Round).\n\n===1970s: Retirement and comeback===\nGosdin retired from performing during the 1970s and moved to Cartersville, Georgia, where he operated a glass company.<ref name=\"jw1-575\"/> In 1976, he signed with [[Elektra Records]] and his first hit was a remake of \"Hangin' On\", which featured [[Emmylou Harris]] on harmony vocals and peaked at No.&nbsp;16.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> His next single, \"Yesterday's Gone\" written by Wayne Hinsen Bradford who also wrote for Emmylou Harris, which also featured Harris, became his first Top 10 hit in 1977.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Several more hits followed between 1977 and 1979 with the biggest of these hits being a remake of \"Till the End\" and a cover of [[The Association]]'s \"[[Never My Love]]\" which also featured harmony vocals from [[Janie Frickie]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===1981\u20131983: \"Today My World Slipped Away\"===\nIn 1981, Gosdin signed with [[Ovation Records]] and scored a Top 10 hit with \"Dream of Me\". After Ovation Records closed their doors later in 1981, Gosdin signed with A.M.I. Records where he scored a Top 10 hit in 1982 with \"Today My World Slipped Away\". (This song later became a number-three hit for [[George Strait]]).\n\nIn January 1982, during a trial that examined the attempted assassination of music producer [[Gary S. Paxton]], Darryl C. Langley claimed under oath that he and his cohort were hired attackers employed by Gosdin, who worked closely with Paxton and was alleged to be disgruntled in their working relationship. Gosdin was never arrested or charged and repeatedly refused to confirm or deny involvement for the remainder of his life.\n\nGosdin signed with Complete Records in the early 1980s, and, in 1984, released ''There Is A Season'', picked by the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' as best country album of the year.\nThe early 1980s also found a great combination of talent as Gosdin traveled from coast to coast opening shows for George Jones.\n\n===1983\u20131985: \"If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)\"' and ''There Is a Season''===\nGosdin made the top 10 consistently in the early 1980s, really hitting his stride when he teamed with Barnes as a songwriting collaborator. The pair specialized in songs of cheating and barroom romance, often delivering an over-the-top emotionalism that got Gosdin compared to [[George Jones]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1983, Gosdin had two top 5 hits \u2014 \"If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)\" and \"Way Down Deep\" with the former earning him a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Grammy Award for Best Country Vocal Performance, Male.]] The following year, he had his first No.&nbsp;1 single with \"I Can Tell by the Way You Dance (You're Gonna Love Me Tonight)\",<ref name=\"jw40\"/> which had previously been recorded by [[Gary Morris]].<ref name=\"jw1-575\"/> On September 22, 1985, Gosdin appeared at the original Farm Aid concert at the University of Illinois' Memorial Stadium.\n\n===1987\u20131989: \"Chiseled in Stone\"===\nAfter Compleat Records went bankrupt, Gosdin signed with Columbia in 1987. He immediately had success with \"Do You Believe Me Now\", and scored another No.&nbsp;1 hit with a tribute to [[Ernest Tubb]] called \"Set 'Em Up Joe\".<ref name=\"jw40\"/> Gosdin's \"[[Chiseled in Stone]]\", co-written with Barnes, won the Country Music Association's Song of the Year award in 1989 and earned them a nomination for the [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song]].\n\n===1989\u20131990: ''Alone''===\nGosdin's 1989 album, ''Alone'', was a concept album in a traditional country style. It chronicled the dissolution of Gosdin's marriage and included his final number-one hit: \"I'm Still Crazy\".<ref name=\"jw40\"/> From 1989 to 1991, he released a number of songs and three more made the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' top 10: \"Right in the Wrong Direction\", \"That Just About Does It\" and \"Is It Raining at Your House\". \"Raining\" has been covered by [[Brad Paisley]] and [[Lorrie Morgan]], and \"That Just About Does It\" by [[Willie Nelson]].\n\n===Later years===\nGosdin suffered a stroke in 1998, but he continued writing and singing up until his death. In 2009, Gosdin collaborated with Joe Sins of the country music duo The Sins to write and record his final four songs.\n\n==Death==\nGosdin suffered another stroke in early April 2009, and died at a Nashville hospital on the evening of April 28 at the age of 74.<ref name=\"Obit\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1610248/singer-songwriter-vern-gosdin-dies-in-nashville-at-age-74/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510233623/http://www.cmt.com/news/1610248/singer-songwriter-vern-gosdin-dies-in-nashville-at-age-74/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 10, 2015|title=Singer-Songwriter Vern Gosdin Dies in Nashville at Age 74|first=Calvin|last=Gilbert|website=CMT News|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> His remains were buried at [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Nashville)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]] in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Vern Gosdin discography}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n=== Grammy Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[26th Grammy Awards|1984]]\n|\"[[If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)]]\"\n|[[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Best Male Country Vocal Performance]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[31st Grammy Awards|1989]]\n|\"[[Chiseled in Stone]]\"\n|[[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|}\n\n=== Academy of Country Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[13th Academy of Country Music Awards|1978]]\n|Vern Gosdin\n|[[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Top New Male Vocalist]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[24th Academy of Country Music Awards|1989]]\n|\"[[Set 'Em Up Joe]]\"\n|Song of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|''[[Chiseled in Stone (album)|Chiseled in Stone]]''\n|[[Academy of Country Music Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Country Music Association Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[1983 Country Music Association Awards|1983]]\n|Vern Gosdin\n|[[Country Music Association Award for New Artist of the Year|Horizon Award]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|\"[[If You're Gonna Do Me Wrong (Do It Right)]]\"\n|[[Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[1984 Country Music Association Awards|1984]]\n|rowspan=2| Vern Gosdin\n|Horizon Award\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[1988 Country Music Association Awards|1988]]\n|[[Country Music Association Award for Male Vocalist of the Year|Male Vocalist of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|''[[Chiseled in Stone (album)|Chiseled in Stone]]''\n|Album of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[1989 Country Music Association Awards|1989]]\n|rowspan=2| \"[[Chiseled in Stone]]\"\n|[[Country Music Association Award for Single of the Year|Single of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|Song of the Year\n|{{won}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Hines, Geoffrey (1998). \"Vern Gosdin\".

He was a [[Nashville sound]] (country/popular music) innovator of the late 1950s, and scored 147 songs on the ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' country music charts, second only to [[George Jones]]. He sold more than 85 million records. A member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] (beginning 1943) and the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] (beginning 1966), Arnold ranked 22nd on [[Country Music Television]]'s 2003 list of \"The 40 Greatest Men of Country Music.\"\n\n== Early years ==\nArnold was born on May 15, 1918, on a farm near [[Henderson, Tennessee]]. His father, a [[Sharecropping|sharecropper]], played the [[fiddle]], while his mother played guitar. Arnold's father died when he was just 11, forcing him to leave school and begin helping on the family farm. This led to him later gaining his nickname, the '''Tennessee Plowboy'''. Arnold attended [[Pinson High School]] in [[Pinson, Tennessee]], where he played guitar for school functions and events. He quit before graduation to help with the farm work, but continued performing, often arriving on a mule with his guitar hung on his back. Arnold also worked part-time as an assistant at a [[mortuary]].<ref name=\"cmenc\">{{cite book|last=Stambler|first=Irwin|author2=Grelun Landon |author3=Lyndon Stambler |title=Country Music: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Macmillan Publishers|year=2000|pages=17\u201319|isbn=978-0-312-26487-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RjfB6-nVHZIC&q=Eddy+Arnold&pg=PA17|access-date=July 15, 2009}}</ref>\n[[File:Downtown henderson tennessee.jpg|left|thumb|Downtown Henderson, Tennessee, the city near which Arnold was born]]\n\nIn 1934, at age 16, Arnold made his debut on WTJS-AM in [[Jackson, Tennessee]].

Due to their expanding career, the Statlers left Cash's entourage around the mid-1970s to concentrate on their own career, a departure that took place on good terms.\n\nTwo of the Statlers' best-known songs are \"[[Flowers on the Wall]],\" their first major hit that was composed and written by Lew DeWitt, and the socially conscious \"[[Bed of Rose's]]\". In the 1980s, the Statlers were a mainstay on [[Spike TV|The Nashville Network (TNN)]], where their videos were shown regularly. Also on TNN, between 1991 and 1998, they hosted ''[[The Statler Brothers Show]]'', a weekly [[variety show]], which was the network's top-rated program for its entire 7-year run.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmacanada.ca/go/site/news/2007/09/ |title=Biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214092844/http://www.gmacanada.ca/go/site/news/2007/09/ |archive-date=December 14, 2007 |website=Rex Allen, Jr.'s official website |access-date=April 18, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1995-01-07-9501070171-story.html |title=Statler Bros.'

They recorded two comedy albums under the [[pseudonym]] Lester \"Roadhog\" Moran and the Cadillac Cowboys, and one-half of one side of the album ''Country Music Then and Now'' was devoted to satirizing small-town radio stations' Saturday-morning shows.\n\nThe Statlers earned the number-one spot on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' chart]] four times, for \"[[Do You Know You Are My Sunshine]]?\" in 1978, \"[[Elizabeth (The Statler Brothers song)|Elizabeth]]\" in 1984, and in 1985, \"[[My Only Love (song)|My Only Love]]\" and \"[[Too Much on My Heart]].\"<ref name=\"CMT\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/statler_brothers/bio.jhtml |title=Artist Biography: The Statler Brothers |access-date=April 17, 2008 |work=[[Country Music Television]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325074504/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/statler_brothers/bio.jhtml |archive-date=March 25, 2008}}</ref> Since forming, the Statlers have released over 40 albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thestatlerbrothers.com/discography/ |title=Discography |website=The Statler Brothers' Official website |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://statlerbrothers.com/ |title=The Statlers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509155220/http://statlerbrothers.com/ |archive-date=May 9, 2008 |access-date=April 10, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, the Statler Brothers purchased and renovated their former elementary school, Beverly Manor, in Staunton, occupying the complex for several years. The complex consisted of offices for the group, a small museum and auditorium, and an adjacent building that served as office space for unrelated businesses. A garage was built to store the two tour buses that the group had used for many years. The group has since sold the complex, which Grace Christian Church in Staunton converted back into an academic campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gcswarriors.org/contact-us/directions.cfm |title=Elementary/Middle School Directions |website=Grace Christian School |access-date=June 1, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, the group began performing at an annual [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] festival in Gypsy Hill Park in Staunton. The event, known as \"Happy Birthday USA,\" lasted for 25 years, and included many country-music figures, including [[Mel Tillis]], [[Charley Pride]], and many others. The event drew as many as 100,000 fans each year. The group also honored their hometown with the song \"Staunton, Virginia\" on their 1973 album ''Do You Love Me Tonight''.\n\nDeWitt retired from the Statler Brothers in 1982 due to ill health.

He joined the [[United States Air Force]] in May 1949, and served as a [[flight engineer]] on the [[B-29 Super Fortress]] during the [[Korean War]] in the early 1950s. In [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], Martin was once sitting at a railroad crossing and a fellow that closely resembled his chief boom operator, Willie Wilson, passed by sitting in a [[boxcar]]. He said, \"There goes Willie.\" He pulled over and wrote a song entitled \"Boxcar Willie\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} It eventually stuck and became Martin's nickname. In 1962, Martin met his future wife, Lloene, in [[Boise, Idaho]]. They later had four children.\n\nIn [[San Jose, California]], Martin attended a talent show as \"Boxcar Willie\" and performed under that nickname for the first time. He won first place and a $150 prize. That was his part-time vocation, however, as he was still in the Air Force and had been flying daily missions. In the early 1970s, while assigned to the [[181st Airlift Squadron|136th Air Refueling Wing]] of the [[Texas Air National Guard]], Martin served as a flight engineer aboard the [[Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighter]] and participated in Operation Creek Party. This operation provided critical in-flight refueling services for fighter aircraft assigned to the [[United States Air Forces in Europe]] for 10 years.\n\nIn 1976, Martin retired from the Air Force and became a full-time performer. One of his first national appearances was a win on [[Chuck Barris]]' ''[[The Gong Show]]''. In the late 1970s, Martin traveled to [[Grand Prairie, Texas]], where he purchased hundreds of [[8-track tape]]s pre-recorded with his music to sell later in various places. After he received a contract with other recording studios, he discontinued his dealings with Cleo McDonald.{{Context inline|date=January 2023}}\n\nMartin entered American mainstream pop culture consciousness due to a series of television commercials for record compilations of artists who were obscure in the United States, yet had large international followings, such as [[Slim Whitman]] and [[Gheorghe Zamfir]]. Martin went on to become a star in [[country music]].

He also performed at music festivals and other venues until his death in 2018.\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood and military service===\nHart was born to a [[sharecropping|sharecropper]] family in [[Loachapoka, Alabama]], United States,<ref name=\"AlamHOF\">[http://www.alamhof.org/freddiehart.html Alabama Music Hall of Fame Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304134031/http://www.alamhof.org/freddiehart.html |date=March 4, 2009 }}, Alamhof.org; retrieved September 18, 2008</ref> and spent his childhood in nearby [[Phenix City, Alabama]], along with his 11 siblings (Nadine, Bo, Junior, Olin, Marrell, Pearl, Lonnie, Sandra, Gail, J.P., Harold, and a child who died in infancy). He learned to play guitar at age 5 and quit school by age 12. At age 15, Hart lied about his age to join the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] during [[World War II]], seeing combat action on [[Guam]] and [[Iwo Jima]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Following the war, Hart lived in California where he taught classes in self-defense at the Los Angeles Police Academy.<ref name=\"AlamHOF\" />\n\n===Early career===\nHart got an early career break when singer [[Carl Smith (country musician)|Carl Smith]] [[cover version|covered]] Hart's song \"[[Loose Talk (song)|Loose Talk]]\" in 1955. Other artists who recorded his songs included [[Patsy Cline]] (\"Lovin' In Vain\"), [[George Jones]] (\"My Tears are Overdue\") and [[Porter Wagoner]] (\"Skid Row Joe\").\n\nDuring the early 1950s, Hart and his family moved to California to further the growing country music scene there. In 1951, he joined [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s band for a year.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> It was through Frizzell that Hart got his first recording contract with [[Capitol Records]] in 1953.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He released several singles including his version of \"Loose Talk\", but none of these were successful.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1958, Hart signed with [[Columbia Records]] and scored his first chart hit with \"The Wall\" in 1959 which made the Top 20.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> His biggest hit for the label was the 1960 Top 20 hit \"The Key's In The Mailbox\".\n\nIn 1965, Hart signed with [[Kapp Records]] where he would score several Top 40 hits between 1965 and 1968. The biggest of these hits included \"Hank Williams' Guitar\" (1965), \"Born A Fool\" (1968) and \"Togetherness\" (1968).\n\n===Re-signing with Capitol Records and Easy Loving===\nIn 1969, Hart re-signed with Capitol Records and soon became a part of the [[Bakersfield sound]] by signing up with [[Buck Owens]]' songwriting and management company. In early 1970, he scored a Top 30 hit with \"The Whole World's Holdin' Hands\". Hart's song \"Togetherness\", a hit for him in 1968, became a Top 15 hit for Buck Owens and [[Susan Raye]] that summer. Hart would score several minor hits during the year.\n\nIn 1971, Hart released a song that he wrote called \"[[Easy Loving]]\" which was first recorded in the summer of 1969 for his album ''California Grapevine'', released in 1970.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Released in the summer of 1971, \"Easy Loving\" rapidly began climbing the charts; and by that September, it was No. 1 for three weeks on the country chart and reached No. 17 on the pop chart. It was also played on adult contemporary stations, earning a position on ''Billboard's'' Easy Listening survey. The song would ultimately win Hart numerous awards from both the [[Academy of Country Music]] and [[Country Music Association]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The song sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in November 1971.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/294 294]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/294\n}}</ref> The album of the same name also reportedly went gold. The song also earned Hart a [[Grammy Award]] nomination.\n\nFrom this success, Hart and his backup band, the Heartbeats, had a string of Top 5 hits with \"[[My Hang-Up Is You]]\" (six weeks at No. 1 in 1972), \"[[Bless Your Heart (song)|Bless Your Heart]]\" (No. 1 in 1972), \"[[Got the All Overs For You (All Over Me)]]\" (No. 1 in 1972), \"If You Can't Feel It (It Ain't There)\" (1973), \"[[Super Kind of Woman]]\" (No. 1 in 1973), \"[[Trip to Heaven]]\" (No. 1 in 1973), \"Hang In There Girl\" (1974), \"The Want-To's\" (1974), \"My Woman's Man\" (1975), \"The First Time\" (1975), \"I'd Like To Sleep Till I Get Over You\" (1975) and \"The Warm Side of You\" (1975).<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He has been called by many fans as \"The Heart and Soul of Country Music\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nWith the success of \"Easy Loving\" and other songs he wrote, plus a popular concert attraction on the road, Hart became independently wealthy and owned a songwriting company, a school for the blind, a trucking company, and a chain of [[martial arts]] studios\u2014his hobby was as a master of karate.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\n===Late 1970s\u20131980s===\nBy 1976, Hart continued to have major hits although now his streak of Top 10s were replaced by a streak of Top 20 and Top 30 hits. These included \"You Are The Song Inside Of Me\" (1976), \"That Look In Her Eyes\" (1976), \"Thank God She's Mine\" (1977), \"The Pleasure's Been All Mine\" (1977), \"Toe to Toe\" (1978), and \"Wasn't It Easy Baby\" (1979). His last Top 10 hit came with the hit \"Why Lovers Turn to Strangers\" in 1977, which peaked at No. 8. This song was written by east Idaho based composer Bobby Fender.\n\nIn 1980, Hart signed with [[Sunbird Records]], and immediately scored a Top 20 hit with \"Sure Thing\" that year. He followed this up with three Top 40 hits in 1981. This ended his days as a major country artist. In 1985 and 1987, he had a couple of minor hits on El Dorado and 5th Avenue Records, with his last hit being \"The Best Love I Never Had\" in 1987 peaking at No. 77.\n\n===Later years and death===\nIn 2001, Hart was inducted into the [[Alabama Music Hall of Fame]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alamhof.org/freddiehart|title=Biography|website=Alabama Music Hall of Fame|access-date=August 7, 2021}}</ref> A few years later, Phenix City declared a major east\u2013west street Freddie Hart Parkway in his honor.\n\nHart released a handful of new albums on CD, showcasing his passion for gospel music, patriotism and the traditional country sound that originally made him famous. These albums prompted him to selectively tour and perform concerts around the world. Hart retained a large following in Europe and the U.S., performing at music festivals, universities, churches and industry events.\n\nHart continued to write and record gospel music during the 2000s. He received numerous awards and had several number one songs in the gospel field. In 2004 he was inducted into the Nashville Songwriter's Hall Of Fame. In 2017 he performed in Pigeon Forge Tennessee and received the Hall Of Fame award from the North American Country Music Associations International. His final performance was in March 2018 on the [[Ernest Tubb]] [[Midnite Jamboree]] as a special guest to [[David Frizzell]]. Hart sang a new song he had written and just recorded about Lefty Frizzell, titled simply \"Lefty\". In April 2018, Hart recorded his final album titled ''God Bless You''. The project, produced by David Frizzell, contains 11 newly written gospel songs and a remake of his signature song \"Easy Loving\". The album was released in late 2018.\n\nHart died as a result of pneumonia on October 27, 2018, in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name=\"Obit\">{{Cite

Heartbeats==\nFreddie Hart first used the name Heartbeats, a play on his last name, as his backing on a one-off 1967 album credited to Freddie Hart and the Heartbeats, but after his hit \"[[Easy Loving]]\" in 1971, ten studio albums were released between 1972 and 1977 credited to Freddie Hart and the Heartbeats. Various musicians performed in the Heartbeats over the years, including Bobby Wayne and Dennis Hromek, both of whom would go on to join [[The Strangers (American band)|the Strangers]]. During their heyday in the mid-1970s, the Heartbeats even released one studio album credited to just themselves in 1975.\n\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize = width:1200 height:auto barincrement:25\nPlotArea = left:100 bottom:80 top:0 right:0\nAlignbars = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod = from:01/01/1967 till:12/31/1977\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\n\nLegend = orientation:horizontal position:bottom\n\nColors =\n  id:gtr     value:blue      legend:Rhythm_Guitar_and_Front_Man\n  id:steel    value:green       legend:Steel_Guitar_and_Band_Leader\n  id:lead   value:orange legend:Lead_Guitar\n  id:organ    value:pink        legend:Guitorgan\n  id:bass     value:purple      legend:Bass\n  id:drums     value:yellow        legend:Drums\n\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:2 start:1967\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:1 start:1977\n\nBarData =\n   bar:Bobby    text:\"Bobby Wayne\"\n   bar:Dennis    text:\"Dennis Hromek\"\n   bar:Jimmy text:\"Jimmy Collins\"\n   bar:Dave   text:\"Dave Allen\"\n   bar:Buddy     text:\"Buddy Church\"\n   bar:Marc     text:\"Marc Chase\"\n   bar:Jim    text:\"Jim Morin\"\n   bar:JD    text:\"JD Walters\" \n   bar:Glen  text:\"Glen Brodeur\"\n   bar:Archie   text:\"Archie Michaud\"\n\nPlotData =\n   width:10\n   bar:Bobby   from:01/01/1967 till:01/01/1968 color:gtr\n   bar:Dave from:01/01/1967 till:01/01/1968 color:steel\n   bar:Dennis from:01/01/1967 till:01/01/1968 color:bass\n   bar:Jimmy from:01/01/1967 till:01/01/1968 color:drums\n   bar:Marc from:01/01/1972 till:12/31/1977 color:gtr\n   bar:JD from:01/01/1972 till:12/31/1977 color:steel\n   bar:Buddy from:01/01/1972 till:12/31/1977 color:lead\n   bar:Jim from:01/01/1972 till:12/31/1977 color:organ\n   bar:Glen from:01/01/1972 till:12/31/1977 color:bass\n   bar:Archie   from:01/01/1972 till:12/31/1977 color:drums\n    \n}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As part of [[the Gatlin Brothers]] trio that included his younger brothers Steve and Rudy, he achieved considerable success within the country music genre, performing on 33 top 40 country singles, a total inclusive of his recordings as a solo artist and with the group.\n\nGatlin is known for his tenor voice and for the country songs that he recorded in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of Gatlin's greatest hits include \"[[Broken Lady]]\", \"[[All the Gold in California]]\", \"[[Houston (Means I'm One Day Closer to You)]]\", \"She Used to Be Somebody's Baby\" and \"Night Time Magic\". During this time, country music trended toward slick pop-music arrangements in a style that came to be known as [[Countrypolitan]]. Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers came to prominence and enjoyed their greatest success during this period with hit singles that showcased the brothers' rich gospel-inflected harmonies and Larry's poetic lyrics.\n\n== Early life ==\nGatlin was born in [[Seminole, Texas|Seminole]] in [[Gaines County, Texas]], United States,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> next to the [[New Mexico]] border. His father was an oilfield worker, and the family lived in several locations while he was a youth, including [[Abilene, Texas|Abilene]] and [[Odessa, Texas|Odessa]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> He was reared listening to country and Southern gospel music. He has performed with his brothers Steve and Rudy since childhood. When they were younger, they often sang at their local church along with their sister [[LaDonna Gatlin|LaDonna]]<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and occasionally performed on local radio and television shows. They also recorded a gospel music album for the Sword and Shield label and topped [[Roy Orbison]] in a local talent contest.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nGatlin was a quarterback at [[Odessa High School (Texas)|Odessa High School]]. After graduation in 1966, he was eligible to serve in the military during the [[Vietnam War]],<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://thelittleredblog.typepad.com/blog/2014/09/president-gatlin-declares-world-war-iii.html\n| title      = President Gatlin Declares World War III\n| author       = Jack Shifflett\n| date       = September 4, 2014\n| access-date = September 7, 2014\n}}</ref> but he chose to attend the [[University of Houston]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> As a [[wide receiver]] on the [[Houston Cougars football|football team]], he caught a [[touchdown]] pass in a 1968 game in which his team scored 100 points.<ref>{{cite web\n| url        = http://bill37mccurdy.wordpress.com/tag/houston-100-tulsa-6-1968/\n| title      = 1968: About That Houston 100-Points Game\n| work       = The Pecan Park Eagle\n| date       = September 15, 2013\n| access-date = September 7, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nHe later auditioned for and joined the gospel music group [[the Imperials]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sghistory.com/index.php?n=I.Imperials|title=Southern Gospel History &#124; I / Imperials|website=Sghistory.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/artists/program290.html|title=PBS \u2013 Austin City Limits|website=[[PBS]] |date=November 11, 2001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011111093015/http://www.pbs.org/klru/austin/artists/program290.html|access-date=2021-08-07|archive-date=2001-11-11}}</ref> The Imperials went on to perform in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] in January 1971 at ''[[Jimmy Dean|Jimmy Dean's Las Vegas Revue]]''. While walking through the showroom, Gatlin caught country singer [[Dottie West]]'s attention, who thought that he resembled [[Mickey Newbury]].{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} West was impressed with Gatlin's songwriting skills, and she recorded two of his compositions, \"You're the Other Half of Me\" and \"Once You Were Mine\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> West also passed one of Gatlin's [[demo (music)|demo tapes]] around [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and arranged for him to relocate there by purchasing a plane ticket for him.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} West recorded other compositions by Gatlin that would later become hits for him, including \"Broken Lady\", which appeared on West's 1978 album ''[[Dottie (album)|Dottie]]''.\n\n=== As a solo artist ===\nWith West's help, Gatlin found work in Nashville as a [[Backing vocalist|background singer]] for [[Kris Kristofferson]]. In 1973, Gatlin landed a solo recording contract with [[Monument Records]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nIn December 1973, Gatlin released his first album, ''The Pilgrim''.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Two singles were released from the album: \"Sweet Becky Walker\" and \"Bitter They Are, Harder They Fall\", although both failed to chart.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The latter song was recorded by [[Elvis Presley]] in 1976 (who had also recorded Gatlin's \"[[Help Me (Larry Gatlin song)|Help Me]]\" in 1973).<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> 1974 saw the release of a new album, ''Rain/Rainbow'', and the song \"Delta Dirt\". The album and single proved more successful; \"Delta Dirt\" was a top-20 country hit, peaking at number 14. The song was also Gatlin's only entry into the pop charts, when it reached number 84. In 1975, Gatlin had his first major hit with his composition \"Broken Lady\", which reached number five on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart in 1976<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and won him a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Country Song]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> A new album, ''High Time'', was released in 1976.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Gatlin is also credited on guitar on [[Willie Nelson]]'s 1976 album ''[[The Troublemaker (album)|The Troublemaker]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nBrothers Steve and Rudy made their first appearance on Larry's 1976 album ''Larry Gatlin with Family & Friends''. They were featured on some of Gatlin's other hits during the late 1970s, notably \"I Don't Wanna Cry\", \"Love Is Just a Game\" and \"Statues Without Hearts\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1978, Gatlin scored his first number-one hit with \"[[I Just Wish You Were Someone I Love]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In 1978, he released his last solo album, ''Oh Brother'', which featured the top-10 hits \"I've Done Enough Dyin' Today\" and \"[[Night Time Magic]]\". The latter song reached the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Easy Listening]] chart. Both songs spotlighted Gatlin's soaring falsetto that became a trademark of his vocal style.\n\nIn 1985, Gatlin purchased shares in the [[Nashville Sounds]], a [[Minor League Baseball]] team of the [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]].<ref>{{citation|first=Larry|last=Woody|title=Schmittou: A Grand Slam in Baseball, Business, And Life|publisher=Eggmann Publishing Company|location=Nashville|year=1996|isbn=1886371334|pages=64\u201365}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=1985 |title=Sounds Owners |work=The Nashville Sounds 1985 Official Souvenir Program |publisher=Nashville Sounds |page=6}}</ref>\n\n=== With the Gatlin Brothers ===\n[[File:Gatlin Brothers Nashville Sounds 1985.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|The Gatlin Brothers in the uniforms of the [[Nashville Sounds]] in 1985 (from left to right: Larry, Steve and Rudy)]]\nIn 1979, when Gatlin signed with [[Columbia Records]], he decided to officially have his brothers billed as Larry Gatlin & the Gatlin Brothers. In October, they released the album ''Straight Ahead''. It spawned the single \"[[All the Gold in California]]\", which became their greatest hit together, reaching number one on the [[Hot Country Songs]] list. This was Gatlin's second number-one hit, and he was named Top Male Vocalist of the Year by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. On June 6, 1980, ''Straight Ahead'' was certified gold.\n\nThe group's next big hit came in early 1980 with \"Take Me to Your Lovin' Place\", which peaked at number five in 1981. They next released \"What Are We Doin' Lonesome\", which peaked at number four later in the year. They continued with top-10 and top-20 hits such as \"In Like with Each Other\" (1982), \"She Used to Sing on Sunday\" (1982), \"Sure Feels Like Love\" (1982), \"Almost Called Her Baby by Mistake\" (1983) and \"Denver\" (1984). In 1983, the group released their third and last number-one hit, \"Houston (Means I'm One Day Closer to You)\". On January 19, 1985, the Gatlin Brothers sang \"All the Gold in California\" at the nationally televised second inauguration gala for [[Ronald Reagan]]. Though the group never achieved another number-one hit, they came close with \"She Used to Be Somebody's Baby\" (1986, number two), \"Talkin' to the Moon\" (1987, number four) and \"Love of a Lifetime\" (1988, number four).\n\nThe Gatlin Brothers were also one of the first country groups to appear in music videos, such as [[1984 in country music|1984's]] \"[[The Lady Takes the Cowboy Everytime]]\"{{Sic}}. In 1985, Gatlin wrote the song \"Indian Summer\" with [[Barry Gibb]], which he recorded as a duet with [[Roy Orbison]]. In 1989, the Gatlin Brothers sang \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\" before Game 3 of the [[1989 World Series]] at [[Candlestick Park]] in San Francisco just before the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Loma Prieta earthquake]] occurred. They also sang the national anthem at Game 5 of the [[1985 World Series]] and Game 6 of the [[2005 NBA Finals]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n=== Later work ===\nGatlin's chart success declined greatly when a new breed of [[neotraditional country]] singers entered Nashville around 1986. New stars such as [[Dwight Yoakam]] and [[Randy Travis]] pushed Gatlin and other Countrypolitan vocalists out of the top 10. Gatlin recorded a duet in 1987 with country-pop singer [[Janie Fricke]],<ref>''The Billboard Book Of Top Country Hits'', Joel Whitburn, {{ISBN|0-8230-8291-1}}, 2006</ref> but the song reached only number 21. He briefly signed with [[Universal Records (1988)|Universal Records]] in 1989, where he recorded his last singles. His last charting single was released in 1989, titled \"Number One Heartache Place\". Gatlin underwent surgery on his vocal cords in 1991. In concert, he had begun to struggle with the high falsetto notes that were featured prominently in many of his songs. After recovery, Gatlin worked briefly with an opera coach to rebuild his voice, and his vocals took a powerful operatic style.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}\n\n[[File:Larry Gatlin playing cards in Croatia.JPEG|thumb|Gatlin (left) playing cards with [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]]s in [[Croatia]] after a performance in 1995]]\nAfter more than a decade of singing together, in December 1992, the Gatlin Brothers embarked on a farewell tour before retiring to their own theater in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]].

The [[Federal architecture|Federal-style]] structure was built in 1786, then called \"Pilot's Knob,\" on a military outpost by [[American Revolutionary War]] Captain James Franklin, the father of planter and slave trader [[Isaac Franklin]] (1789\u20131846). After the war, he was awarded a land grant to the property.\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the Plantation became a station camp for [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] soldiers. In order to protect their valuable gold and silver from approaching [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers, the occupants buried the metals in the ground surrounding the house. This gold was later discovered during renovation of the home in 1976.\n\nThe area has been struck twice by [[tornado]]es; once in 1892 and again on [[April 6\u20138, 2006 Tornado Outbreak|April 6, 2006]].

Jones recalled to ''Billboard'' in 2006 that he would lie in bed with his parents on Saturday nights listening to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', and would insist that his mother wake him if he fell asleep so that he could hear [[Roy Acuff]] or [[Bill Monroe]]. \n\nIn his autobiography ''I Lived To Tell It All'', Jones recalled that the early death of his sister Ethel worsened his father's drinking problem, which caused him to be physically and emotionally abusive to his wife and children. In his biography ''George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend'', Bob Allen recounts how George Washington Jones would return home drunk in the middle of the night with his cronies, wake up his terrified son and demand that he sing for them or face a beating. In a [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] episode of ''Inside Fame'' dedicated to Jones's life, country music historian Robert K. Oermann said, \"You would think that it would make him not a singer, because it was so abusively thrust on him. But the opposite happened; he became ... someone who had to sing.\"  In the same program, Jones admitted that he remained ambivalent and resentful towards his father until the day he died. He observed in his autobiography, \"The Jones family makeup doesn't sit well with liquor ... Daddy was an unusual drinker. He drank to excess, but never while working, and he probably was the hardest working man I've ever known.\" His father bought him his first guitar at age nine and he learned his first chords and songs at church. Several photographs show a young George busking on the streets of Beaumont.\n\n[[File:Hank Williams MGM Records - cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hank Williams]], Jones's biggest musical influence]] \nHe left home at 16 and went to [[Jasper, Texas]], where he sang and played on the KTXJ radio station with fellow musician Dalton Henderson. He moved to the KRIC radio station, and during an afternoon show there met his idol, [[Hank Williams]] (\"I just stared,\" he later wrote).<ref name=\"CMTNews\"/> In the 1989 video documentary ''Same Ole Me'', Jones admitted, \"I couldn't think or eat nothin' unless it was Hank Williams, and I couldn't wait for his next record to come out. He had to be, really, the greatest.\"  He married his first wife Dorothy Bonvillion in 1950; they divorced in 1951. He was enlisted in the [[United States Marines]] and until his discharge in 1953 was stationed in San Jose, California.<ref name=\"isbn0-87930-760-9\">{{cite book |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |title=All Music Guide to Country |edition=2nd |publisher=Backbeat |location=San Francisco |year=2003 |page=387 |isbn=0-87930-760-9}}</ref>\n\n===First recordings (1954\u20131957)===\n\nJones married Shirley Ann Corley in 1954. His first record, the self-penned \"[[No Money in This Deal]]\", was recorded on January 19 and was released in February on Starday Records. This began Jones's association with producer and mentor [[Pappy Daily|H.W. \"Pappy\" Daily]]. The song was cut in the living room of Starday Records' co-founder Jack Starnes, who produced it. Around this time Jones also worked at KTRM (now [[KZZB]]) in Beaumont. Deejay Gordon Baxter told Nick Tosches that Jones had acquired the nickname \"possum\" while working there. During his early recording sessions, Daily admonished Jones for attempting to sound too much like his heroes Hank Williams and [[Lefty Frizzell]]. In 1996 Jones recalled to [[NPR]] that the quality of production at Starday was poor. \"It was a terrible sound. We recorded in a small living room of a house on a highway near Beaumont. You could hear the trucks. We had to stop a lot of times because it wasn't soundproof, it was just egg crates nailed on the wall and the big old semi trucks would go by and make a lot of noise and we'd have to start over again.\" Jones's first hit came with \"[[Why Baby Why]]\" in 1955, and in that year, while touring as a cast member of the ''Louisiana Hayride'', Jones met and played shows with [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Johnny Cash]]. In 1994, Jones told [[Nick Tosches]] that Presley \"stayed pretty much with his friends around him in his dressing room\". Jones remained a lifelong friend of Johnny Cash, and was invited to sing at the ''Grand Ole Opry'' in 1956.\n\nWith Presley's explosion in popularity in 1956, pressure was put on Jones to cut some rockabilly sides. He reluctantly agreed, but his heart was not in it and he quickly regretted his decision. He joked later in his autobiography, \"When I've encountered those records I've used them for Frisbees.\"  He told ''Billboard'' in 2006: \"I was desperate. When you're hungry, a poor man with a house full of kids, you're gonna do some things you ordinarily wouldn't do. I said, 'Well, hell, I'll try anything once.'  I tried 'Dadgum It How Come It' and '[[Rock It (George Jones song)|Rock It]]', a bunch of shit. I didn't want my name on the rock and roll thing, so I told them to put Thumper Jones on it and if it did something, good, if it didn't, hell, I didn't want to be shamed with it.\" He unsuccessfully attempted to buy all the masters to keep the cuts from surfacing later, which they did.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/the-615/1559863/george-jones-the-billboard-interview-2006 |title=George Jones: The Billboard Interview (2006) |first=Ray |last=Waddell |date=April 26, 2013 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=December 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJones moved to [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] in 1957, teamed up with singer Jeannette Hicks, the first of several duet partners he would have over the years, and had another top-10 single with \"[[Yearning (song)|Yearning]]\". Starday Records merged with Mercury that year, and Jones was rated highly on the charts with his debut Mercury release, \"Don't Stop the Music\". Although he was garnering a lot of attention, and his singles were making very respectable showings on the charts, he was still travelling the black-top roads in a 1940s Packard with his name and phone number on the side, playing the \"blood bucket\" circuit of honky-tonks that dotted the rural countryside.<ref name=\"CMTNews\"/>\n\n===Commercial breakout (1959\u20131964)===\n[[File:George Jones and Melba Montgomery--1960s.jpg|thumb|upright|One of George Jones's duet partners was [[Melba Montgomery]]. In the 1960s, they recorded a series of duets such as \"[[We Must Have Been Out of Our Minds]]\".]]\n\nIn 1959, Jones had his first number one on the ''Billboard'' country chart with \"[[White Lightning (George Jones song)|White Lightnin']]\", which was a more authentic rock and roll sound than his half-hearted rockabilly cuts.\n\nJones had early success as a songwriter. He wrote or co-wrote many of his biggest hits during this period, several of which became standards, such as \"[[Window Up Above]]\" (later a hit for [[Mickey Gilley]] in 1975) and \"[[Seasons of My Heart]]\" (a hit for Johnny Cash, and also recorded by [[Willie Nelson]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]). Jones wrote \"[[Just One More (song)|Just One More]]\" (also recorded by Cash), \"Life To Go\" (a top-five hit for [[Stonewall Jackson (musician)|Stonewall Jackson]] in 1959), \"[[You Gotta Be My Baby]]\", and \"Don't Stop The Music\" on his own, and had a hand in writing \"[[Color of the Blues]]\" (covered by [[Loretta Lynn]] and [[Elvis Costello]]), \"[[Tender Years]]\", and \"[[Tall, Tall Trees]]\" (co-written with [[Roger Miller]]). Jones's most frequent songwriting collaborator was his childhood friend Darrell Edwards.\n\nJones signed with [[United Artists Records|United Artists]] in 1962, and immediately scored one of the biggest hits of his career, \"[[She Thinks I Still Care]]\". His voice had grown deeper during this period, and he began cultivating his own singing style. During his stint with UA, Jones recorded albums of Hank Williams and [[Bob Wills]] songs, and cut an album of duets with [[Melba Montgomery]], including the hit \"[[We Must Have Been Out of Our Minds]]\". Jones was also gaining a reputation as a hell-raiser. In his ''Rolling Stone'' tribute, [[Merle Haggard]] recalled:\n\n:\"I met him at the Blackboard Caf\u00e9 in Bakersfield, California, which was the place to go in '61. He was already famous for not showing up or showing up drunk, and he showed up drunk. I was onstage \u2013 I think I was singing [[Marty Robbins]]' '[[Devil Woman (Marty Robbins song)|Devil Woman]]' \u2013 and he kicked the doors of the office open and said 'Who the fuck is that?'  It was one of the greatest compliments of my entire life when George Jones said I was his favorite country singer ... In 1967, I released a ballad called \"I Threw Away The Rose\" and he was so impressed he actually jumped ship and left his tour, rented a Lear Jet and came to Amarillo, Texas. He told me my low note changed his life. \"<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/merle-haggard-remembers-george-jones-20130506 |title=Merle Haggard Remembers George Jones |last1=Haggard |first1=Merle |date=May 6, 2013 |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJones was always backed by the Jones Boys on tour. Like Buck Owens's Buckaroos and Merle Haggard's Strangers, Jones worked with many talented musicians, including [[Daniel Joseph Schafer|Dan Schafer]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://timashley.tripod.com/schafer_pic.html |first=Tim |last=Ashley |title=Dan Schafer Artist performances |website=Tripod |access-date=February 5, 2012}}</ref> Hank Singer, Brittany Allyn, [[Sonny Curtis]], Kent Goodson, Bobby Birkhead, and Steve Hinson. In the 1980s and 1990s, bass player Ron Gaddis served as the Jones Boys' bandleader and sang harmony with Jones in concert. [[Lorrie Morgan]] (who married Gaddis) also toured as a backup singer for Jones in the late 1970s and early 1980s. [[Johnny Paycheck]] was the Jones Boys' bass player in the 1960s before going on to his own stardom in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Alcoholism and decline (1964\u20131979) ===\n\nIn 1964, Pappy Daily secured a new contract with Musicor records. For the rest of the 1960s, Jones scored only one number one (1967's \"Walk Through This World With Me\"), but he featured often in the country music charts. Significant hits included \"[[Love Bug (George Jones song)|Love Bug]]\" (a nod to [[Buck Owens]] and the Bakersfield sound), \"[[Things Have Gone to Pieces]]\", \"[[The Race Is On]]\", \"My Favorite Lies\", \"[[I'll Share My World with You]]\", \"Take Me\" (which he co-wrote and later recorded with Tammy Wynette), \"[[A Good Year for the Roses]]\", and \"[[If My Heart Had Windows (song)|If My Heart Had Windows]]\". Jones's singing style had by now evolved from the full-throated, high lonesome sound of Hank Williams and Roy Acuff on his early Starday records to the more refined, subtle style of Lefty Frizzell. In a 2006 interview with ''Billboard'', Jones acknowledged the fellow Texan's influence on his idiosyncratic phrasing: \"I got that from Lefty. He always made five syllables out of one word.\"\n\nJones's binge drinking and use of amphetamines on the road caught up to him in 1967, and he had to be admitted into a neurological hospital to seek treatment for his drinking. Jones would go to extreme lengths for a drink if the thirst was on him. A drinking story concerning Jones occurred while he was married to his second wife Shirley Corley. Jones recalled Shirley trying to prevent him from travelling to [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], 8 miles away, to buy liquor. She said she hid the keys to all their cars, but she did not hide the keys to the lawn mower. He wrote in his memoir: \"There, gleaming in the glow, was that ten-horsepower rotary engine under a seat. A key glistening in the ignition. I imagine the top speed for that old mower was five miles per hour. It might have taken an hour and a half or more for me to get to the liquor store, but get there I did.\"{{sfn|Jones|Carter|1996|pages=112\u2013113}} Years later Jones comically mocked the incident by making a cameo in the video for \"[[All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight]]\" by [[Hank Williams Jr.]] He also parodied the episode in the 1993 video for \"[[One More Last Chance]]\" by [[Vince Gill]] and in his own music video for the single \"Honky Tonk Song\" in 1996. Tammy Wynette, in her 1979 autobiography ''Stand By Your Man'', claimed the incident occurred while she was married to Jones. She said she woke at one in the morning to find her husband gone. \"I got into the car and drove to the nearest bar 10 miles away. When I pulled into the parking lot, there sat our rider-mower right by the entrance. He'd driven that mower right down a main highway... He looked up and saw me and said, \u2018Well, fellas, here she is now. My little wife, I told you she'd come after me.\u2019\"<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Wynette |first1=Tammy |last2=Dew |first2=Joan |title=Stand By Your Man |year=1979 |location=New York |publisher=Simon & Schuster |page=200}}</ref> Jones had become aware of Tammy Wynette because their tours were booked by the same agency and their paths sometimes crossed. Wynette was married to songwriter Don Chapel, who was also the opening act for her shows, and the three became friends. Jones married Wynette in 1969.\n\n[[File:Tammy Wynette 1977.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tammy Wynette]] in 1971]]\nThey began touring together, and Jones bought out his contract with Musicor so that he could record with Wynette and her producer [[Billy Sherrill]] on [[Epic Records]] after she had split with longtime producer Pappy Daily. In the early 1970s, Jones and Wynette became known as \"Mr. & Mrs. Country Music\" and scored several big hits, including \"[[We're Gonna Hold On]]\", \"Let's Build A World Together\", \"[[Golden Ring (song)|Golden Ring]]\" and \"Near You\". When asked about recording Jones and Wynette, Sherill told Dan Daley in 2002, \"We started out trying to record the vocals together, but George drove Tammy crazy with his phrasing. He never, ever did it the same way twice. He could make a five-syllable word out of 'church.' Finally, Tammy said, 'Record George and let me listen to it, and then do my vocal after we get his on tape.' \"\n\nIn October 1970, shortly after the birth of their only child Tamala Georgette, Jones was straitjacketed and committed to a padded cell at the Watson Clinic in Lakeland, Florida, after a drunken bender. He was kept there for 10 days to detoxify, before being released with a prescription for [[Chlordiazepoxide|Librium]]. Jones managed to stay sober with Wynette for long periods, but as the decade wore on, his drinking and erratic behavior worsened and they divorced in 1976. Jones accepted responsibility for the failure of the marriage, but denied Wynette's allegations in her autobiography that he had beaten her and fired a shotgun at her. Jones and Wynette continued playing shows and drawing crowds after their divorce, as fans began to see their songs mirroring their stormy relationship. In 1980, they recorded the album ''Together Again'' and scored a hit with \"Two Story House\".  In the 2019 Ken Burns documentary ''Country Music,'' Jones and Wynette were compared to \"two wounded animals\". Jones also spoke of his hopes for a reconciliation, and would jokingly reference Wynette in some of his songs \u2013 during performances of his 1981 hit \"If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will)\" he would sing \"Tammy's memory will\" \u2013 but the recriminations continued. Jones and Wynette appeared to make peace in the 1990s, and recorded a final album, ''One'', and toured together again before Wynette's death in 1998. In 1995, Jones told ''Country Weekly'', \"Like the old saying goes, it takes time to heal things and they've been healed quite a while.\"\n\nJones's pairing with Billy Sherrill at Epic Records came as a surprise to many; Sherrill and business partner [[Glenn Sutton]] are regarded as the defining influences of the countrypolitan sound, a smooth amalgamation of pop and country music that was popular during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, a far cry from George's honky-tonk roots. Despite a shaky start, the success that Sherrill had with Jones proved to be his most enduring; although ''Billboard'' chart statistics show that Sherrill had his biggest commercial successes with artists such as Wynette and [[Charlie Rich]], with Jones, Sherrill had his longest-lasting association. In Sherrill, Jones found what Andrew Meuller of ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' described as \"the producer capable of creating the epically lachrymose arrangements his voice deserved and his torment demanded...He summoned for Jones the symphonies of sighing strings that almost made the misery of albums like 1974's ''[[The Grand Tour (George Jones album)|The Grand Tour]]'' and 1976's ''[[Alone Again (album)|Alone Again]]'' sound better than happiness could possibly feel.\"  In 1974, they scored a number-one hit with the instant classic \"The Grand Tour\" and followed that with \"The Door\" (\"I've heard the sound of my dear old mother cryin'/and the sound of the train that took me off to war\"), another number-one smash. Unlike most singers, who might have been overwhelmed by the string arrangements and background vocalists Sherrill sometimes employed on his records, Jones's voice, with its at times frightening intensity and lucid tone, could stand up to anything. While Jones wrote fewer songs himself \u2013 songwriters had been tripping over themselves pitching songs to him for years \u2013 he still managed to co-write several, such as \"[[What My Woman Can't Do]]\" (also recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis), \"A Drunk Can't Be A Man\", the harrowing \"[[I Just Don't Give a Damn]]\" (perhaps the greatest \"lost classic\" in the entire Jones catalogue), and \"[[These Days (I Barely Get By)]]\", which he had written with Wynette.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Jones spiraled out of control. Already drinking constantly, a manager named Shug Baggot introduced him to [[cocaine]] before a show because he was too tired to perform. The drug increased Jones's already considerable paranoia. During one drunken binge, he shot at, and very nearly hit, his friend and occasional songwriting partner Earl \"Peanutt\" Montgomery after Montgomery had quit drinking after finding religion. He was often penniless and acknowledged in his autobiography that Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash came to his financial aid during this time. Jones also began missing shows at an alarming rate and lawsuits from promoters started piling up. In 1978, owing Wynette $36,000 in child support and claiming to be $1 million in debt, he filed for bankruptcy. Jones appeared incoherent at times, speaking in quarrelling voices that he would later call \"the Duck\" and \"the Old Man\". In his article \"The Devil In George Jones\", Nick Tosches states, \"By February 1979, he was homeless, deranged, and destitute, living in his car and barely able to digest the junk food on which he subsisted. He weighed under a hundred pounds, and his condition was so bad that it took him more than two years to complete ''My Very Special Guests'', an album on which Willie Nelson, [[Linda Ronstadt]], Elvis Costello, and other famous fans came to his vocal aid and support. Jones entered Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. Upon his release in January 1980, the first thing he did was pick up a six-pack.\"\n\nJones often displayed a sheepish, self-deprecating sense of humor regarding his dire financial standing and bad reputation. In June 1979, he appeared with Waylon Jennings on [[Ralph Emery]]'s syndicated radio program, and at one point Jennings cracked, \"It's lonely at the top.\"  A laughing Jones replied, \"It's lonely at the bottom, too!  It's real, real lonely, Waylon.\"  Despite his chronic unreliability, Jones was still capable of putting on a captivating live show. On Independence Day, 1976, he appeared at [[Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic]] in Gonzales, Texas, in front of 80,000 younger, country-rock oriented fans. A nervous Jones felt out of his comfort zone and nearly bolted from the festival, but went on anyway and wound up stealing the show. ''The Houston Post'' wrote, \"He was the undisputed star of this year's Willie Nelson picnic...one of the greatest.\"  ''Penthouse'' called him \"the spirit of country music, plain and simple, its Holy Ghost\". ''The Village Voice'' added, \"As a singer he is as intelligent as they come, and should be considered for a spot in America's all-time top ten.\"  Jones began missing more shows than he made, however, including several highly publicized dates at the Bottom Line club in New York City. Former vice president of CBS Records Rick Blackburn recalls in the 1989 video ''Same Ole Me'' that the event had been hyped for weeks, with a lot of top press and cast members from ''Saturday Night Live'' planning to attend. \"We'd made our plans, travel arrangements, and so forth. George excused himself from my office, left \u2013 and we didn't see him for three weeks. He just ''did not show up''.\"  Much like Hank Williams, Jones seemed suspicious of success and furiously despised perceived slights and condescension directed towards the music that he loved so dearly. When he finally played the Bottom Line in 1980, the ''New York Times'' called him \"the finest, most riveting singer in country music\".\n\n===Comeback (1980\u20131990)===\n{{Original research|section|date=March 2017}}\nBy 1980, George Jones had not achieved a number-one single in six years, leading many critics to doubt his career. However, he surprised the music industry when \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" reached number one on the country charts, staying there for 18 weeks. The song, written by [[Bobby Braddock]] and [[Curly Putman]], tells the story of a man who continues to love his departed lover until his death. Jones's poignant delivery of the song has made it one of the greatest country songs of all time. Jones's interpretation, buoyed by his delivery of the line \"first time I'd seen him smile in years,\" gives it a mournful, gripping realism. It is consistently voted as one of the greatest country songs of all time, along with \"[[I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry]]\" by Hank Williams and \"[[Crazy (Willie Nelson song)|Crazy]]\" by [[Patsy Cline]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/100-greatest-country-songs-of-all-time-20140601/4-george-jones-he-stopped-loving-her-today-1980-0711432/ |title=100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time: 4.

The Academy of Country Music awarded the song Single of the Year and Song of the Year in 1980. It also became the Country Music Association's Song of the Year in both 1980 and 1981.\n\nThe success of \"[[He Stopped Loving Her Today]]\" led [[CBS Records (2006)|CBS Records]] to renew Jones's recording contract and sparked new interest in the singer. He was the subject of an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled ''George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends'', which had him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, [[Tanya Tucker]], and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" obviously inebriated, like when he performed \"I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool\" with [[Barbara Mandrell]] at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online,<ref>{{Citation |title=Drunk Country Singer George \"The Possum\" Jones arrest | date=December 6, 2022 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLGTEr8WJMQ |language=en |access-date=2023-01-04}}</ref> offers a glimpse into Jones's alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, \"One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune.\"  In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of ''The Village Voice'', \"I don't show a lot of affection. I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. I saved it all for the songs. I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. The only way I could would be to do it in a song.\"  Years later he commented to the Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, \"I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. You don't deserve those fans. You don't deserve makin' this money.'  And you're mad at yourself. And you beat up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life.\"  In 1982, Jones recorded the album ''A Taste of Yesterday's Wine'' with Merle Haggard; while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}  His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting \"[[I'm Not Ready Yet]]\", \"[[Same Ole Me]]\" (backed by the [[Oak Ridge Boys]])\", \"[[Still Doin' Time]]\", \"[[Tennessee Whiskey (song)|Tennessee Whiskey]]\", \"[[We Didn't See a Thing]]\" (a duet with Ray Charles), and \"[[I Always Get Lucky with You]]\", which was Jones's last number one in 1984.\n\nIn 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorc\u00e9e from Mansfield, Louisiana. Sepulvado's positive impact on Jones's life and career cannot be overstated.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Schmitt |first=Brad |title=Nancy Jones: God sent me to save George Jones |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2015/04/22/george-jones-nancy-jones-alcoholism/26201255/ |access-date=2023-01-04 |website=The Tennessean |language=en-US}}</ref> She eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, \"He was drinking but he was fun to be around. It wasn't love at first sight or anything like that. But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him.\"  Jones managed to quit cocaine, but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in fall 1983, and was once again straitjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tosches |first=Nick |date=1994-07-01 |title=The Devil in George Jones |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/the-devil-in-george-jones/ |access-date=2024-08-22 |website=Texas Monthly |language=en}}</ref>  By that time, though, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama \u2013 at the age of 52 \u2013 Jones performed his first sober show since the early '70s. \"All my life it seems like I've been running from something,\" he told the United Press International in June. \"If I knew what it was, maybe I could run in the right direction, but I always seem to end up going the other way.\"  Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with \"No Show Jones\", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years, and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling ''Billboard'' in 2006, \"I know it hurt my fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time.\"\n\nMostly sober for the rest of the 1980s, Jones consistently released albums with Sherrill producing, including ''Shine On'', ''Jones Country'', ''You've Still Got A Place In My Heart'', ''Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes'', ''Wine Colored Roses'' (an album Jones would tell Jolene Downs in 2001 was one of his personal favorites), ''Too Wild Too Long'', and ''One Woman Man''. Jones's video for his 1985 hit \"[[Who's Gonna Fill Their Shoes]]\" won the CMA award for Video of the Year  (Billy Sherrill makes a cameo as the bus driver).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=The Boot StaffThe Boot |date=2024-03-04 |title=41 Years Ago: George Jones Marries Nancy Sepulvado |url=https://theboot.com/george-jones-nancy-sepulveda-wedding/ |access-date=2024-08-22 |website=The Boot |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Later years and death (1990\u20132013)===\n\nIn 1990, Jones released his last proper studio album on Epic, ''You Oughta Be Here With Me''. Although the album featured several stirring performances, including the lead single \"Hell Stays Open All Night Long\" and the [[Roger Miller]]-penned title song, the single did poorly and Jones made the switch to MCA, ending his relationship with Sherrill and what was now [[Sony Music]] after 19 years. His first album with MCA, ''And Along Came Jones'', was released in 1991, and backed by MCA's powerful promotion team and producer Kyle Lehning (who had produced a string of hit albums for [[Randy Travis]]), the album sold better than his previous one had. However, two singles, \"You Couldn't Get The Picture\" and \"She Loved A Lot In Her Time\" (a tribute to Jones's mother Clara), did not crack the top 30 on the charts, as Jones lost favor with country radio, as the format was altered radically during the early 1990s. His last album to have significant radio airplay was 1992's ''[[Walls Can Fall]]'', which featured the novelty song \"Finally Friday\" and \"[[I Don't Need Your Rockin' Chair]]\", a testament to his continued vivaciousness in his sixties. Despite the lack of radio airplay, Jones continued to record and tour throughout the 1990s and was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] by Randy Travis in 1992. In 1996, Jones released his autobiography ''I Lived To Tell It All'' with Tom Carter, and the irony of his long career was not lost on him, with the singer writing in its preface, \"I also know that a lot of my show-business peers are going to be angry after reading this book. So many have worked so hard to maintain their careers. I never took my career seriously, and yet it's flourishing.\"  He also pulled no punches about his disappointment in the direction country music had taken, devoting a full chapter to the changes in the country music scene of the 1990s that had him removed from radio playlists in favor of a younger generation of pop-influenced country stars. (Jones had long been a critic of [[country pop]], and along with Wynette and [[Jean Shepard]], he was one of the major backers of the Association of Country Entertainers, a guild promoting traditional country sounds that was founded in 1974; Jones's divorce from Wynette was a factor in the association's collapse.) Despite his absence from the country charts during this time, latter-day country superstars such as [[Garth Brooks]], Randy Travis, [[Alan Jackson]], and many others often paid tribute to Jones, while expressing their love and respect for his legacy as a true country legend who paved the way for their own success. On February 17, 1998, [[The Nashville Network]] premiered a group of television specials called ''The George Jones Show'', with Jones as host.<ref name=\"CMTNews\"/>  The program featured informal chats with Jones holding court with country's biggest stars old and new, and of course, music. Guests included Loretta Lynn, [[Trace Adkins]], Johnny Paycheck, Lorrie Morgan, Merle Haggard, [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], [[Tim McGraw]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Charley Pride]], [[Bobby Bare]], [[Patty Loveless]], and Waylon Jennings, among others.\n\nWhile Jones remained committed to \"pure country\", he worked with the top producers and musicians of the day and the quality of his work remained high. Some of his significant performances include \"I Must Have Done Something Bad\", \"Wild Irish Rose\", \"Billy B. Bad\" (a sarcastic jab at country music establishment trendsetters), \"A Thousand Times A Day\", \"When The Last Curtain Falls\", and the novelty \"High-Tech Redneck\". Jones's most popular song in his later years was \"Choices\", the first single from his 1999 studio album ''Cold Hard Truth''. A video was also made for the song, and Jones won another Grammy for Best Male Country Vocal Performance. The song was at the center of controversy when the Country Music Association invited Jones to perform it on the awards show, but required that he perform an abridged version. Jones refused and did not attend the show. Alan Jackson was disappointed with the association's decision, and halfway through his own performance during the show, he signaled to his band and played part of Jones's song in protest.\n\nOn March 6, 1999, Jones was involved in an accident when he crashed his [[sport utility vehicle]] near his home. He was taken to the [[Vanderbilt University Medical Center]] (VUMC), where he was released two weeks later.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/37895/george-jones-cheats-death |title=George Jones Cheats Death |first=Joal |last=Ryan |date=March 19, 1999 |work=E!

Perhaps I was always just an old fashioned drunk.\")  \nThe crash was a significant turning point, as he explained to ''Billboard'' in 2006: \"when I had that wreck, I made up my mind, it put the fear of God in me. No more smoking, no more drinking. I didn't have to have no help, I made up my mind to quit. I don't crave it.\" After the accident, Jones went on to release ''The Gospel Collection'' in 2003, for which Billy Sherrill came out of retirement to produce.<ref name=\"TAC\"/>  He appeared at a televised Johnny Cash Memorial Concert in Jonesboro, Arkansas, in 2003, singing \"Big River\" with Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson.

Active since 1979, he has recorded over 20 studio albums and charted over 50 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including sixteen that reached the number-one position. \n\nTravis's commercial success began in the mid-1980s with the release of his album ''[[Storms of Life]]'', which sold more than four million copies. Travis followed up his successful debut with a string of platinum and multi-platinum albums. By the mid-1990s, Travis saw a decline in his chart success. In 1997, he left [[Warner Bros. Records]] for [[DreamWorks Records]]; he signed to [[Word Records]] for a series of gospel albums beginning in 2000 before transferring back to Warner at the end of the 21st century's first decade. Travis sold over 25 million records and has won seven Grammy Awards, eleven [[Academy of Country Music|ACM Awards]], eight [[Dove Awards]], and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 2016, Travis was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]]. Major songs of his include \"[[On the Other Hand]]\", \"[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]\", \"[[I Told You So (Randy Travis song)|I Told You So]]\", \"[[Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart]]\", and \"[[Three Wooden Crosses]]\".\n\nTravis is noted as a key figure in the [[neotraditional country]] movement, a return to more traditional sounds within the genre following the [[country pop]] crossovers of the early 1980s. He is considered an influence on later generations of country singers, and is noted for his [[baritone]] singing voice. Nearly all of his albums were produced or co-produced by [[Kyle Lehning]], with frequent co-writing credits from Travis, [[Paul Overstreet]], [[Don Schlitz]], and [[Skip Ewing]]. Since surviving a near-fatal [[stroke]] in 2013, which severely limited his singing and speaking ability, he has released archival recordings and made limited public appearances. James Dupr\u00e9 has toured singing his songs with Travis's road band. In 2024, Travis released \"[[Where That Came From]]\", his first studio recording since his stroke, where his voice was re-created using [[artificial intelligence]].\n\nTravis also holds several film and television acting roles, including the television movies ''[[Wind in the Wire (film)|Wind in the Wire]]'' and ''[[A Holiday to Remember]]'', episodes of the television series ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'', and the [[Patrick Swayze]] movie ''[[Black Dog (1998 film)|Black Dog]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nRandy Bruce Traywick was born May 4, 1959, in [[Marshville, North Carolina]].{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=365-366}} He is the second of six children to Bobbie Traywick ([[n\u00e9e]] Tucker) and Harold Traywick.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=1-3, 8, 9}}{{sfn|Travis|Abraham|2019|p=3}} Harold Traywick worked as a meat packer and also built houses.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=8, 9}} He also enjoyed listening to [[country music]] such as [[Ernest Tubb]] and [[Patsy Cline]], in addition to singing, playing guitar, and writing his own songs. By the time Randy was eight years old, his father would send him and his brothers to the house of a friend named Kate Magnum, who would teach him and his brothers Ricky and David how to play guitar.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=12}} Harold also constructed a stage behind the family house, where he would invite friends over to hear his sons sing.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=13}} Randy and Ricky performed publicly for the first time in 1968 at a talent show held at the local [[elementary school]]; while the brothers did not win, they continued to perform at local talent shows, with David later joining to accompany them on [[bass guitar]].{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=13-14}}\n\nRandy dropped out of school in the ninth grade.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=18}} As a teenager, he committed a number of criminal offenses. These included [[reckless driving]] after he crashed Ricky's car in a cornfield, breaking into a church to hold a party, [[driving under the influence]], [[resisting arrest]], and stealing knives and watches from a local store.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=18}} On his seventeenth birthday, Randy was arrested for [[public intoxication]] and faced imprisonment.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=19}} Despite his charges, [[Don Cusic]] noted in the 1990 book ''Randy Travis: The King of the New Country Traditionalists'' that his parents still supported him, as they would pay his [[bail]] and support him in court whenever he was arrested.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=19}}\n\nIn 1977, the Traywicks entered a talent competition held in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], after hearing an advertisement for it on the radio. The grand prize for the contest was $100 cash and a recording session.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=21}} The contest consisted of eight semi-final audition rounds held every Tuesday at Country City USA, a [[nightclub]] co-owned by Randy's then-future wife, Mary Elizabeth \"Lib\" Hatcher.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=21}}<ref name=\"virgin\"/> At the performance, Randy played [[rhythm guitar]] and sang, while Ricky played [[lead guitar]]. However, Ricky had to drop out of the competition partway through because he had to serve time at a [[youth detention center]], leaving Randy to continue as a solo act. Randy ended up winning the competition.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=21-22}} After doing so, he began to hold a conversation with Hatcher about his then-impending arrest charges for [[hot-wiring]] a neighbor's truck.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=22}} Hatcher and disc jockey John Harper, who also worked at the club, chose to represent Randy in court, which led to him serving [[probation]] and coming under the custody of the Hatchers in lieu of a jail sentence.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=22}}<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Additionally, Hatcher employed Randy as a singer at Country City USA.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=22}} During this time, Hatcher advised him on his singing and performance. Harold would attend Randy's performances in this timespan, but was later banned from the club after altercations with patrons.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=27-28}}\n\n==Music career==\nHatcher booked a number of country music singers to perform at her club as a means of making connections with country music executives in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=29-30}} One such singer, [[Joe Stampley]], agreed to produce a session for Traywick in Nashville. Hatcher paid $10,000 for the recording session and promotion, which was done through a small independent label based out of [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], called Paula Records. The session accounted for the singles \"She's My Woman\" and \"I'll Take Any Willing Woman\". Traywick and Hatcher distributed copies of the single to radio stations throughout the [[Southern United States]] in 1979. The former reached 91 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=30}} After the failure of these singles, Hatcher and Traywick continued submitting [[demo (music)|demo]] recordings to executives but were unable to garner interest at first.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=31}} In 1981, Traywick and Hatcher chose to move to Nashville to put themselves closer to the center of the country music industry. Despite this, they would still travel back to Charlotte on weekends to tend to business at Country City USA, which by that point had relocated to a larger building.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=29, 40}} They supported themselves by renting out part of their Nashville house to songwriter [[Keith Stegall]], who used it as an office.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=39, 41}} Stegall then introduced the two to song publisher and disc jockey Charlie Monk at a golf game, which led to him performing songs for Monk. Stegall also submitted Traywick's demos to various Nashville producers to garner interest in a recording contract. Traywick recorded one session with producer John Ragsdale for the intent of signing him to [[Curb Records]], but the label ultimately chose not to sign him.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=42-43}}\n\nIn 1982 Hatcher began managing a nightclub called the Nashville Palace through the recommendation of singer [[Ray Pillow]]. She initially hired Traywick to wash dishes, but soon began to have him perform there as well. By this point, the two had begun crediting the singer as Randy Ray, as they thought the name was easier to pronounce than \"Traywick\".{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=46-47}} Hatcher also rented her in-house office space out to other industry executives, including staff of ''[[Radio & Records]]'' magazine; meanwhile, Randy Ray continued to work on his songwriting under Stegall's mentorship.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=51-52}} By the end of the year, Hatcher and Nashville Palace owner John Hobbs financed an independent album titled ''Randy Ray Live at the Nashville Palace'', which consisted of ten songs recorded by him at the Palace. Stegall served as producer on this project.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=55-57}} He also auditioned on ''You Can Be a Star'', a talent show on the former [[The Nashville Network|Nashville Network]] (TNN), in early 1983. He placed second behind Lang Scott, who would later marry country singer [[Linda Davis]].{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=54}} [[Ralph Emery]] also invited him to perform several times on the TNN talk show ''[[Nashville Now]]'', which he hosted.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=63, 64}}\n\nDespite the exposure from ''Nashville Now'', he still failed to secure a recording contract throughout 1984.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=63, 64}} Martha Sharp, then working in [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) at [[Warner Bros. Records]]'s Nashville division, attended a seminar in late 1984 where executives suggested signing attractive young artists with a \"traditional\" sound. Through mutual contacts with Monk and Stegall, she became aware of Randy Ray, who at the time was working on more songs with the latter.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=72}} Sharp arranged for him to be signed to a contract initially consisting of four songs. Executives disliked the name \"Randy Ray\" as they thought it sounded \"[[podunk]]\", and thus Sharp suggested \"Randy Travis\".{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=72-73}}\n\n===1985{{ndash}}1986: ''Storms of Life''===\nTravis signed with Warner Nashville in early 1985. His first contract with them resulted in the recording of four songs. These were \"Prairie Rose\", \"[[On the Other Hand]]\", \"Carrying Fire\", and \"Reasons I Cheat\". \"Prairie Rose\" appeared on the soundtrack of the 1985 film ''[[Rustlers' Rhapsody]]''.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=74-75}} [[Keith Whitley]] had also recorded \"On the Other Hand\" for his 1985 debut album ''[[L.A. to Miami]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/la-to-miami-mw0000192307 | title=''L.A. to Miami'' | publisher=AllMusic | accessdate=January 18, 2024 | author=Al Campbell}}</ref> These four songs were all recorded in the same session, with Stegall and [[Kyle Lehning]] co-producing. At the time, Lehning was best known for producing [[Dan Seals]] and had also worked with Stegall on his own singles for [[Epic Records]]. Although Lehning did not want to work with Travis at first, he chose to do so after Monk and Sharp encouraged him.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=74-75}} After recording these songs, Travis appeared on ''Nashville Now'' again on May 17, 1985, where he performed with [[Johnny Russell (singer)|Johnny Russell]] and [[Lorrie Morgan]].{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=77}} Warner also included him among the performers at their talent showcase at the Fan Fair (now [[CMA Music Festival]]) in downtown Nashville in mid-1985.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=80-81}} Warner released \"On the Other Hand\" in August 1985, and the song charted at number 67 on Hot Country Songs before falling off.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=81}} The follow-up \"[[1982 (Randy Travis song)|1982]]\" peaked at number six on the country charts in early 1986,{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=365-366}} thus becoming Travis's first hit single.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=82-83}} Following the success of \"1982\", Travis was booked as an opening act for [[Barbara Mandrell]] and [[T. G. Sheppard]], leading to both Travis and Hatcher quitting the Palace.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=83-85}} The song's success also led to him performing on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] for the first time in March 1986.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=86}} He also received an award for Top New Male Vocalist from the [[Academy of Country Music]] (ACM).<ref name=\"acm\">{{cite web | url=https://www.acmcountry.com/winners?awardTitle=randy+travis&awardCategory=&awardYear=&actionButton=Submit | title=Search results for Randy Travis | publisher=[[Academy of Country Music]] | accessdate=January 18, 2024}}</ref> This was followed by further opening act gigs throughout early 1986, which resulted in gigs from [[California]] to [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. For this capacity, Travis and Hatcher bought a former [[multi-stop truck|bread truck]] which they converted to a tour bus, in addition to hiring a five-piece band to perform with him. One of the band members was then-future [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]] member Rocky Thacker.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=93}}\n\n[[File:Don Schlitz, January 2024.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Don Schlitz]] co-wrote Travis's singles \"On the Other Hand\", \"Forever and Ever, Amen\", and \"Deeper Than the Holler\".|alt=A head shot of singer-songwriter Don Schlitz.]]\n\nAfter \"1982\" became Travis's first top-ten hit, Warner executives chose to re-release \"On the Other Hand\". Nick Hunter, who promoted singles to country radio for Warner, noted that the song was popular in sales and listener demand despite its initially low chart peak. Although some radio disc jockeys considered the song \"too country\", it received very high requests from listeners and continued to sell strongly.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=97}} Upon re-release, \"On the Other Hand\" went on to become his first number-one single, reaching the top of the ''Billboard'' country charts in July 1986.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=97-99}} \"On the Other Hand\" and \"1982\" were both included on Travis's debut album for Warner, ''[[Storms of Life]]''.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/randy-travis-mn0000396676#biography | title=Randy Travis biography | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=December 14, 2023 | author=[[Brian Mansfield]]}}</ref> The album was released on June 2, 1986, and sold over 100,000 copies in its first sales week in addition to reaching number one on [[Top Country Albums]].{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=98}} Six years after its release, the album was [[music recording certification|certified triple platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), honoring U.S. sales of three million copies.<ref name=\"riaa\">{{cite web | url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=randy+travis#search_section | title=Search results for Randy Travis | publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] | accessdate=January 18, 2024}}</ref> One of the tracks, Travis's own composition \"Send My Body\", had previously appeared on the Randy Ray album in 1982.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=99}} Lehning and Stegall co-produced the album; they also contributed on keyboard and guitar respectively.

Overstreet wrote \"On the Other Hand\" with [[Don Schlitz]], \"Diggin' Up Bones\" with [[Nat Stuckey]], and \"No Place Like Home\" by himself.{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=365-366}} The latter was also Travis's first single to be promoted through a [[music video]].{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=116-117}}\n\nIn late 1986, Travis was asked to host the [[Country Music Association]] (CMA) Awards telecast to replace original host [[Ricky Skaggs]], who had to back out after his son was hospitalized with a neck injury.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=109-110}} Travis won the Horizon Award (now called Best New Artist) at that ceremony, while also receiving a nomination for Male Vocalist of the Year.

A similar acknowledgement was passed as a city ordinanace in Travis's hometown of Marshville soon afterward.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=112}} Warner also issued a Christmas single in December 1986 titled \"White Christmas Makes Me Blue\", which sold over 79,000 copies.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=114}} By year's end, Skaggs had inducted Travis into the Grand Ole Opry, which was followed by Travis performing \"Diggin' Up Bones\".{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|page=115}} \"Diggin' Up Bones\" also accounted for Travis's first [[Grammy Award]] nomination, in the category of [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Best Male Country Vocal Performance]], in early 1987.{{Sfn|Cusic|1990|pages=121-122}}<ref name=\"grammy\">{{cite web | url=https://www.grammy.com/artists/randy-travis/10366 | title=Randy Travis artist page | publisher=[[Grammy Awards]] | accessdate=January 18, 2024}}</ref>\n\n''Storms of Life'' also received critical favor.

He developed a fondness for country music following an accident in his childhood. He learned to play the guitar during his recovery and began performing locally as well. In his early adulthood, he formed his own band called the Rocky Mountain Playboys, which played gigs and performed on local radio. Locklin was heard singing during one of these gigs, which led to his first recording contract in 1949. He had his first major hit on the ''Billboard'' country chart the same year. His 1953 single \"[[Let Me Be the One (Hank Locklin song)|Let Me Be the One]]\" was his first to top the country chart.\n\nIn 1955, Locklin signed with [[RCA Records|RCA Victor Records]] and under the production of [[Chet Atkins]], he had his biggest success as a country artist. He had a string of major hits during the late 1950s and early 1960s. He also joined the cast of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and remained a member for nearly 50 years. He became a major concert attraction internationally as well, touring overseas in Europe beginning in the 1960s and 70s. Locklin also recorded a handful of concept albums during this period, which made him among the genre's first artists to release albums centered around a theme. He later recorded for other labels, including [[MGM Records|MGM]], [[Plantation Records|Plantation]] and Coldwater. Despite his country success, Locklin never lived in Nashville, choosing to stay in Florida. Locklin died in 2009 at the age of 91.\n\n==Early life==\nLocklin was born and raised in [[McLellan, Florida]]. He was the youngest of four children born to a musically inclined family.

To pursue his music full-time, Locklin dropped out of high school. However, working as a musician amounted to a small income. In one instance, he recalled being paid $2 for working a gig at a Florida roadhouse.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\"/> To make ends meet, he worked odd jobs, including working on a farm and a shipyard.<ref name=\"NY Times\"/>\n\nDuring the early 1940s, Locklin was dismissed from participating in World War II due to the bus accident in his childhood (which still affected his leg). Instead, he continued performing. Locklin performed in nearby states, including regular gigs with bands in [[Mobile, Alabama]]. He also began composing his own material, largely influenced by the music of [[Ernest Tubb]]. He then joined the band of country musician [[Jimmy Swan]] and made regular concert appearances. Locklin formed his own backing band in 1947 named the Rocky Mountain Playboys. The group performed regularly on radio stations. Their sponsor was businessman Elmer Laird, who intended to form a record label to get Locklin's music recorded. However, he was killed in a stabbing incident shortly after his proposal.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> Instead, Locklin's association with producer [[Pappy Daily]] helped him sign with [[Four Star Records]].<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\">{{cite web |last1=Burke |first1=Ken |title=Hungry Hank Locklin returns with \"Generations in Song\" |url=https://www.countrystandardtime.com/d/article.asp?xid=573 |website=Country Standard Time |access-date=30 November 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"CMT\">{{cite web |title=Grand Ole Opry Member Hank Locklin Dies at Age 91 |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1606538/grand-ole-opry-member-hank-locklin-dies-at-age-91/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210210215111/http://www.cmt.com/news/1606538/grand-ole-opry-member-hank-locklin-dies-at-age-91/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 10, 2021 |website=[[Country Music Television]] |access-date=30 November 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===1949\u20131954: Early success===\nLocklin secured a contract with Four Star Records through his association with Pappy Daily.

Because his recording contract allowed for McCall to gain all of the publishing rights, McCall also made all the money from its success. \"I never made no money with him. My understanding was that he liked to go to Vegas. I guess Bill was just a guy who liked to take everything,\" Locklin recalled in 2001.<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\"/>\n\nLocklin's follow-up singles did not become hits, which caused further financial difficulties.<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> He even recorded the original version of his future hit \"Send Me the Pillow You Dream On\". Although it was not a hit, Locklin did recall the song getting a warm reception after he performed it live on a radio show.<ref name=\"Country Standard Time\"/> By this time, McCall had arranged for Locklin's material to be leased to [[Decca Records]], which was headed by [[Owen Bradley]]. With this partnership, he had his second major hit in 1953 titled \"[[Let Me Be the One (Hank Locklin song)|Let Me Be the One]]\".<ref name=\"Allmusic Bio\"/> The single became his first to reach the number one position on the ''Billboard'' country chart. \"Let Me Be the One\" spent a total of three weeks at the country chart summit. His follow-up Four Star releases were unsuccessful.<ref name=\"Billboard Singles\"/> Furthermore, Locklin still was receiving little royalties from his success with the label. In order for McCall to not claim them as his own, he started composing songs under his wife's name. Cuts such as \"These Ruins Belong to You\" were written under the pen name Willa. After an argument with McCall, he left Four Star Records.<ref name=\"Independent\"/>\n\n===1955\u20131974: Move to RCA Records and biggest success===\nIn 1955, Locklin switched to the larger [[RCA Records]]. Collaborating with producer [[Chet Atkins]], Locklin developed a simpler musical style.

Both writers had the idea of writing a \"cheating song\" that centered around a man's conscience. Blair brought in elements from his own marital troubles to write the song. Their finished product was the tune \"[[Please Help Me, I'm Falling]]\". The song was first offered to [[Jim Reeves]], who turned it down.

At 17, he won first prize in a statewide talent show. He graduated from Berea High School, and later worked as a $2-a-show usher and singer at a theater in [[Covington, Kentucky]].

His first single, \"Life is Good Enough for Me / The Lone Cowboy\", was released in June 1933 on the [[Melotone Records (US)|Melotone]] label. In 1937 he returned to Kentucky with Lair to help establish the ''[[Renfro Valley Barn Dance]]'' stage and radio show near [[Mt. Vernon, Kentucky|Mt. Vernon]] in 1939, performing everything from ballads to [[boogie-woogie]] to [[blues]]. In late 1939, Foley became the first country artist to host a network radio program, [[NBC Red Network|NBC]]'s ''Avalon Time'' (co-hosted by [[Red Skelton]]), and he performed extensively at theaters, clubs and fairs. He then returned for another seven-year stint with ''National Barn Dance''.\n\nIn 1941, the same year he made his first of only two [[Cinema of the United States|film]] appearances (portraying himself) with [[Tex Ritter]] in the [[western (genre)|Western]], ''The Pioneers'', Foley signed a lifetime contract with [[Decca Records]]. He also released \"[[Old Shep (song)|Old Shep]]\" in 1941, a song he wrote with Arthur Willis in 1933 about a dog he owned as a boy (in reality, his [[German shepherd]], poisoned by a neighbor, was named Hoover). The song, later recorded by many artists including [[Hank Snow]] and [[Elvis Presley]], became a country classic.<ref name=\"Red Foley Fans Tribute\">{{cite web|url=http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=416559146|title=Red Foley Fans Tribute|website=Myspace.com|access-date=2009-03-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115031809/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile|archive-date=January 15, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> His patriotic 1944 single, \"[[Smoke On The Water (Red Foley song)|Smoke on the Water]]\", topped the folk records chart for 13 consecutive weeks, and on January 17, 1945, Foley was the first country performer to record in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. During the session at [[WSM (AM)|WSM-AM]]'s Studio B, he recorded \"[[Tennessee Saturday Night]]\", \"Blues in My Heart\" and \"Tennessee Border\". He soon became known for such songs as \"The Death of Floyd Collins\" and \"The Sinking of the Titanic\".<ref>The Associated Press (September 21, 1968) \"Red Foley Dead; Country Singer\", ''[[The New York Times]]'', p. 33</ref> He moved to Nashville in 1946 and was briefly a member of the Brown's Ferry Four, recording \"Jesus Hold My Hand\" and \"I'll Meet You in the Morning\".\n\n===Mr. Country Music===\nIn April 1946, Foley signed on to emcee and perform on ''The Prince Albert Show'', the segment of the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' carried on [[NBC Red Network|NBC Radio]]. During the next eight years he established himself as one of the most respected and versatile performers in country music. He acted as master of ceremonies, the straight man for Opry comedians [[Rod Brasfield]] and [[Minnie Pearl]], and proved himself a vocalist who could handle all types of material.<ref name=\"Red Foley Fans Tribute\"/> His popularity was credited with establishing the Opry as America's top country music radio show. In 1949, Foley was part of the Opry's first European tour, visiting U.S. military bases in England, West Germany and the Azores, with Brasfield, [[Roy Acuff]], Minnie Pearl, [[Little Jimmy Dickens]], [[Hank Williams]] and others.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Opry|work=Grand Ole Opry|publisher=Gaylord Entertainment|url=http://opry.com/about/index.html|access-date=2010-01-26|archive-date=July 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727231806/http://www.opry.com/about/index.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nFoley began recording with his backing group, the Cumberland Valley Boys, in 1947. He recorded seven top five hits with the group between 1947 and 1949, including a No.&nbsp;1 single, \"[[New Jolie Blonde (New Pretty Blonde)]]\" (a cover of a 1946 [[Moon Mullican]] hit), and the country boogie anthem \"[[Tennessee Saturday Night]]\", a chart-topper in 1948. In 1950, he had three million-sellers: \"[[Just a Closer Walk with Thee (song)|Just a Closer Walk with Thee]]\", \"[[Steal Away]]\" (recorded by Hank Williams as \"The Funeral\"), and a solo version of the song that became his trademark, \"[[Chattanoogie Shoe Shine Boy]]\".<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/50 50]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/50\n}}</ref> Featuring guitarist [[Grady Martin]], it stayed at No.&nbsp;1 on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s'' [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]] for 13 weeks and hit the pop chart as well.\n\nIn April 1951, Foley was pleased when the popular [[Andrews Sisters]] (Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne) flew from Hollywood to Nashville to join him for a two-day recording session, both acts hoping to repeat the previous successes that the sisters enjoyed when they teamed with [[Burl Ives]] in 1947 and [[Ernest Tubb]] in 1949, producing both folk and country hits. While the results proved to be less popular, the ten tunes recorded were vocally well-executed and received a good deal of play on the country radio stations. The songs included the rhythmic \"Satins and Lace\", the rockabilly-flavored novelty \"Where Is Your Wandering Mother Tonight?\", a very slow rendering of the forlorn hillbilly classic \"[[Bury Me Beneath the Willow]]\", two duets by Foley and Patty Andrews, and two country gospel favorites: \"[[It Is No Secret (What God Can Do)]]\" and \"He Bought My Soul at Calvary\".<ref>Sforza, John: \"Swing It! The Andrews Sisters Story;\" University Press of Kentucky, 2000; 289 pages</ref>\n\nIn 1951, Foley's second wife, Judy Martin, took her own life. To devote more time to his family in Nashville, he cut back on performing but continued to release hits in a variety of styles, including [[rockabilly]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. His 1951 hit, [[Peace in the Valley|\"(There'll Be) Peace in the Valley (for Me)\"]] backed by the Sunshine Boys quartet, was one of the first [[gospel music]] records to sell one million copies. He also released his first LP that year, ''Souvenir Album'' (Decca DL-5303).\n\nFoley's manager was Jim McConnell and \"Dub\" Albritton was his personal appearances manager. Starting in 1951, he hosted ''The Red Foley Show'' on Saturday afternoons on [[NBC#Defining radio's golden age|NBC Radio]] from Nashville (moving to [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] and [[Springfield, Missouri]] from 1956 to 1961) sponsored by [[Dow Chemical]]. On November 21, 1953, he was one of the first eight singers named to ''Billboard'' magazine's Honor Roll of Country and Western artists, \"named by the disk jockeys of America as an all-time great of country & western music.\"<ref>\"Honor Roll of C&W Artists\" (December 5, 1953) ''[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]'', p. 48</ref>\n\nFoley never lost his love for country music and, unlike [[Eddy Arnold]], never sought success as a pop artist, even though many of his recordings made the pop charts.<ref name=\"Red Foley Fans Tribute\"/> Other hits included \"[[Sugarfoot Rag]]\", \"Cincinnati Dancing Pig\" and \"[[Birmingham Bounce]]\", which stayed at No.&nbsp;1 for 14 weeks. Foley's success with the song prompted 21 cover versions. \"One By One\", a duet with [[Kitty Wells]], hit No.&nbsp;1 in 1954 and stayed on the charts for 41 weeks. He also recorded with [[Ernest Tubb]] (with whom he maintained a fictitious on-air \"feud\"), the Dixie Dons, the [[Anita Kerr Singers]], [[Rosetta Tharpe]], Evelyn Knight and the [[Lawrence Welk]] Orchestra.
