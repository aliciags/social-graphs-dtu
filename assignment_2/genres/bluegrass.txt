He then began writing for other artists.

When Johnson left, the Osbornes added guitarist [[Red Allen (bluegrass)|Red Allen]] and fiddler Art Stamper to form a new group.\n\nThe Osborne Brothers and Red Allen (under the pseudonym Stanley Alpine) recorded for Gateway Records in February or March 1956 cutting eight instrumentals. In the spring of 1956, Tommy Sutton, a local disc jockey, helped the Osborne Brothers get a recording contract with [[MGM Records]].<ref name=g67>Goldsmith 2004, p.&nbsp;67.</ref> The new group, with the Osbornes on banjo and mandolin, Allen on guitar, Ernie Newton on bass, Tommy Jackson and Art Stamper on fiddles, made their MGM recording debut on July 1, 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Booklet, Bear Family Records BCD 15598</ref> Their first released 45 RPM single for MGM containing \"Ruby Are You Mad\" became a huge success and led to the Osbornes being signed on as regular members of the WWVA Jamboree in October 1956.<ref name=r155/><ref name=g68>Goldsmith 2004, p.&nbsp;68.</ref> The \"Jamboree version\" of the group comprised Ricky Russell on dobro, Johnny Dacus on fiddle and Ray Anderson on bass. \"Ruby Are You Mad\" marks the first time twin banjos were used on a bluegrass recording.<ref name=g68/> On October 17, 1957, at their third session for MGM, the Osbornes, always experimenting with their sound, added a dobro and drums, also for the first time on a bluegrass recording. In April 1958, Red Allen, who was the last musician to receive billing next to the Osborne Brothers, left the group.<ref name=g69>Goldsmith 2004, p.&nbsp;69.</ref>\n\nUpon their breaking into the bluegrass scene, the Osborne Brothers quickly became known for their virtuoso instrumentation and tight, melodic vocal harmonies. They first made the country chart in 1958 with \"Once More\", performing as a trio with [[Red Allen (bluegrass)|Red Allen]]. The song featured a novel inverted stacked harmony. Bobby sang the lead line highest, with Sonny singing baritone, and the third singer (Red Allen) singing tenor as the lowest part. This made Bobby's distinctive voice the lead, and the third voice was somewhat interchangeable. As a result, they could hire others guitarist and singers without changing the overall sound. The \"high lead\" vocal trio became their signature, and they used to great effect in the country market with songs like \"Blame Me\", \"Sweethearts Again\", and a remake of the Carter Family's \"Fair and Tender Ladies\".\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Osbornes caused minor controversy among Bluegrass music purists by incorporating electronic and percussion instruments in their live acts and studio work. In 1960 they became the first bluegrass group to play on a college campus, performing at Antioch College.<ref name=wd243>Wolff, Duane 2000, p.&nbsp;243.</ref> In 1963 they signed with [[Decca Records]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On August 8, 1964, the Osborne Brothers were inducted as members of the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/MeetTheOpry/Members.aspx?id=116|title=Grand Ole Opry: Members|website=Opry.com|access-date=August 8, 2021|archive-date=September 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911013352/http://www.opry.com/MeetTheOpry/Members.aspx?id=116|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Osborne Brothers recorded their hit \u201cRocky Top\u201d in November 1967.

Active since 1968, Stuart initially toured with [[Lester Flatt]], and then in [[Johnny Cash]]'s road band before beginning work as a solo artist in the early 1980s. He is known for his combination of [[rockabilly]], [[country rock]], and [[bluegrass music]] influences, his frequent collaborations and cover songs, and his distinctive stage dress.\n\nHis greatest commercial success came in the first half of the 1990s on [[MCA Records]] Nashville. Stuart has recorded over 20 studio albums, and has charted over 30 times on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. His highest chart entry is \"[[The Whiskey Ain't Workin']]\", a duet with [[Travis Tritt]]. \n\nStuart has won five [[Grammy Award]]s out of 16 nominations.  He is also a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and [[Country Music Hall of Fame]].\n\n==Early life==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | audio1 = [https://freshairarchive.org/segments/marty-stuart-keeper-country-musics-cowboy-couture-0 Marty Stuart: Keeper Of Country Music's Cowboy Couture], interviewed by [[Terry Gross]] on ''[[Fresh Air]]'', 51:08, October 1, 2014.<ref name=\"Fresh Air\">{{cite web | title =Marty Stuart: Keeper Of Country Music's Cowboy Couture | work = [[Fresh Air]] | publisher =[[WHYY-FM|WHYY]] ([[NPR]]) | date = October 1, 2014 | url =https://freshairarchive.org/segments/marty-stuart-keeper-country-musics-cowboy-couture-0 | access-date =September 15, 2019 }}</ref> }}\nJohn Marty Stuart was born in [[Philadelphia, Mississippi]], on September 30, 1958.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> \n\nStuart learned to play [[guitar]] and [[mandolin]] as a child, and by age 12, he had joined a gospel band called The Sullivans. While a member of this band, Stuart met mandolinist [[Roland White]], a member of [[Lester Flatt]]'s backing band; White invited Stuart to perform with Flatt at a concert in Delaware in 1972, which led to him becoming a regular member of that band. He continued to tour in this capacity until Flatt retired in 1978, and recorded an independent album called ''With a Little Help from My Friends'' that same year. After this, Stuart performed with [[Vassar Clements]] and [[Doc Watson]] before joining [[Johnny Cash]]'s band in 1980.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \n\nIn 1982, he released a second album called ''Busy Bee Cafe'' on [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]]. The album was composed of a [[jam session]] that included a number of country and bluegrass performers such as Cash, Watson, and [[Earl Scruggs]]. In 1985, Stuart accompanied Johnny Cash to Memphis and played on the ''Class of '55'' album that also featured [[Carl Perkins]], [[Roy Orbison]], and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]]. At the end of the session, Perkins presented Stuart with his guitar.<ref>Dickerson, James L., ''Goin' Back to Memphis: A Century of Blues, Rock 'n' Roll and Glorious Soul'', Schirmer Books, 1996, pg. 12</ref> Later that year, Stuart left Cash's band and landed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n==Recording career==\nStuart released his [[Marty Stuart (album)|self-titled debut album]] on Columbia in 1985. The album accounted for Stuart's first chart entry on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts with his first single release, \"[[Arlene (song)|Arlene]]\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Three other singles charted from the album in 1986: \"Honky Tonker\" and \"All Because of You\", both written by [[Steve Forbert]], and Stuart's own \"Do You Really Want My Lovin'\". However, these songs were less successful on the charts.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The success of \"Arlene\" helped Marty to receive a nomination by the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Male Artist of the Year|Top New Male Vocalist]], losing to [[Randy Travis]]. [[AllMusic]] writer Jim Worbois gave the album a mixed review, stating that it was \"Not a great album, but made somewhat more interesting by some of the people appearing on the record and the inclusion of two Steve Forbert songs.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/marty-stuart-mw0000083078 | title=''Marty Stuart'' review | publisher=AllMusic | access-date=August 12, 2020 | author=Jim Worbois}}</ref> He recorded a second album for Columbia titled ''[[Let There Be Country]]'', which charted two singles in 1988: the [[Merle Haggard]] composition \"Mirrors Don't Lie\" and \"Matches\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> Due to the underperformance of the singles, Columbia chose not to release the album, and Stuart exited the label to return to Mississippi.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n===1989-91: Beginning of MCA Records tenure===\nAfter briefly rejoining the Sullivans, he returned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and signed with [[MCA Records]] in 1989.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> That label issued the album ''[[Hillbilly Rock]]'' that year. Co-produced by [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]] and session guitarist [[Richard Bennett (guitarist)|Richard Bennett]], the album charted four singles on Hot Country Songs. First was a cover of Cash's \"[[Cry! Cry! Cry!]]\", followed by \"Don't Leave Her Lonely Too Long\", which Stuart wrote with [[Kostas (songwriter)|Kostas]]. While these were unsuccessful on the charts, the album's [[Hillbilly Rock (song)|title track]] (written by [[Paul Kennerley]]) became Stuart's first top-ten country hit in 1990.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The album's final release was \"[[Western Girls (Marty Stuart song)|Western Girls]]\", which Stuart also co-wrote.<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> ''Hillbilly Rock'' was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) in 1997 for shipments of 500,000 copies.<ref name=\"riaa\">{{cite web | url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=marty+stuart#search_section | title=Search results for Marty Stuart | publisher=Recording Industry Association of America | access-date=August 14, 2020}}</ref>\n\nHis second MCA album, ''[[Tempted (Marty Stuart album)|Tempted]]'', followed in 1991.

In October 2005, Stuart released a concept album, ''Badlands: Ballads of the Lakota'', which pays tribute to the [[Sioux]] culture in what is now [[South Dakota]].

Some of his collection was exhibited at the [[Tennessee State Museum]] in 2007 as \"Sparkle & Twang: Marty Stuart's American Musical Odyssey.\" The  exhibit later appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland, Ohio, and at the Arkansas Statehouse Museum.  In early 2018, Stuart co-curated, along with the [[Grammy Museum]], an exhibit at the [[Woody Guthrie Center]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], entitled \"Marty Stuart's Way Out West: A Country Music Odyssey\".

White was inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] Hall of Fame in 2016, and was inducted a second time in 2019 as a member of the Kentucky Colonels.\n\n==Early years==\nClarence Joseph LeBlanc was born on June 7, 1944, in [[Lewiston, Maine]].<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/> The LeBlanc family, who later changed their surname to White, were of French-Canadian

and as a result, he briefly switched to [[ukulele]], awaiting a time when his young hands would be big enough to confidently grapple with the guitar.<ref name=\"timeless\"/>\n\nIn 1954, when Clarence was ten, the White family relocated to Burbank, California and soon after, Clarence joined his brothers [[Roland White|Roland]] and Eric Jr. (who played [[mandolin]] and banjo respectively) in a trio called Three Little Country Boys.<ref name=\"hjort\"/>  Although they initially started out playing contemporary [[country music]], the group soon switched to a purely [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] repertoire, as a result of Roland's burgeoning interest in the genre.<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/>\n\nIn 1957, banjoist Billy Ray Latham and [[Dobro]] player LeRoy Mack were added to the line-up,<ref

music.<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/>  After attending a performance by [[Doc Watson]] at the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]] folk club in Los Angeles, where he also met the guitarist, Clarence began to explore the possibilities of the acoustic guitar's role in bluegrass music.<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/>  At that time, the guitar was largely regarded as a rhythm instrument in bluegrass, with only a few performers, such as  Watson, exploring its potential for soloing.<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/>  White soon began to integrate elements of Watson's playing style\u2014including the use of open strings and syncopation\u2014into his own flatpicking guitar technique.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>  His breathtaking speed and virtuosity on the instrument<ref name=\"timeless2\"/> was largely responsible for making the guitar a lead instrument within bluegrass.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-guitarists-1234814010/clarence-white-3-1234814623/|title=250 Greatest

and made many live appearances throughout California and the United States.<ref name=\"hjort\"/>  Between bookings with the Colonels, White also made a guest appearance on [[Eric Weissberg]] and [[Marshall Brickman]]'s ''New Dimensions in Banjo & Bluegrass'' album, which would be re-released in 1973 as the [[soundtrack album]] to the film ''[[Deliverance]]'' (with Weissberg and Steve

appearances at various clubs, concert halls and festivals.<ref name=\"hjort\"/> The Colonels' second album, ''[[Appalachian Swing!]]'',<ref name=\"timeless2\"/> was a commercial success and saw

Taylor]] on a Dobro-themed album that was released by World Pacific Records in late 1964 as ''Dobro Country''.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>  Although the brothers were employed as session musicians, the album was credited to Tut Taylor, Roland and Clarence White upon release.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>\n\nAlthough the Colonels were a successful recording act, it was becoming increasingly difficult for them to make a living, due to the waning popularity of the [[American folk music revival]] due to the [[British Invasion]] and homegrown [[folk rock]] acts, such as [[the Byrds]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>  As a result, the Colonels switched to [[electric instrument]]ation<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/> and hired a [[drummer]].<ref>{{Cite

spite of these changes, the Kentucky Colonels dissolved as a band following a show on October 31, 1965.<ref name=\"timeless2\"/>  Clarence, Roland and Eric Jr. formed a new line-up of the Colonels in 1966, with several other musicians, but this second version of the group was short-lived and by early 1967 they had broken up.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\">{{cite

work (1966\u20131968)==\nDuring 1964, White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards [[rock 'n' roll]] as an avenue for artistic expression.<ref name=\"timeless\"/>  Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like [[Doc Watson]], [[Don Reno]] and [[Joe Maphis]], he also idolized the playing of [[jazz guitarist]] [[Django Reinhardt]], rock 'n' roller [[Chuck Berry]], and studio musician [[James Burton]].<ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/>  White even anticipated the viability of a folk/rock hybrid when, in the summer of 1964, he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" with electric instruments.<ref name=\"timeless\"/>  However, despite White's enthusiasm for the project, he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiment's validity<ref name=\"timeless\"/> and ultimately, the song was instead recorded by Dickson's proteges, the Byrds.<ref>{{cite

Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-313-33845-8}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the original line-up of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965, White had become a respected and well-known guitarist.<ref name=\"timeless\"/>  Abandoning bluegrass temporarily, he switched from his [[Martin D-28]] acoustic guitar to an electric [[Fender Telecaster]], with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burton.<ref name=\"lightning\"/>  Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique, switch from [[open chord]]ing to [[fret]]ting the whole [[Neck (music)|guitar neck]] with his left hand, and practice using the tone and volume controls.<ref name=\"lightning\"/>  However, he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and, between 1965 and 1968, he undertook session work for artists including [[Ricky Nelson]], [[the Monkees]], and the [[Vern Gosdin|Gosdin Brothers]].<ref name=\"timeless\"/><ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/> \n  \nAs 1965 turned into 1966, White met [[Gene Parsons]] and [[Gib Guilbeau]] at a recording session for the Gosdin Brothers and, shortly after, he began to perform live with the duo in local California clubs, as well as doing regular session work on their records, which were released under the moniker of Cajun Gib and Gene.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/>  1966 also saw White

Prior to the advent of the more aggressive flatpicking style pioneered by guitarists like Watson and White, the guitar was strictly a rhythm instrument, save for a few exceptions (such as the occasional guitar track by banjoist [[Don Reno]]). Many of the most influential flatpickers of the 20th century cite White as a primary influence, including [[Dan Crary]], [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]], and [[Tony Rice]].  Rice owned and played White's highly modified 1935 [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] D-28. [[David Grier]] and [[Russ Barenberg]] are two other acoustic guitarists who were heavily influenced by White's guitar work.  White's bluegrass playing with the Kentucky Colonels was also a considerable influence on [[Jerry Garcia]] of the [[Grateful Dead]],<ref name=\"lightning\"/> who traveled with the band during 1964.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Livin' in the Past|others=[[Kentucky Colonels]]|year=2003|first=John|last=Delgatto|page=2|type=CD booklet|publisher=Sierra Records|location=Pasadena}}</ref>\n\nOn the electric side of the guitar spectrum, White was similarly influential.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Together with fellow Byrds bandmember [[Gene Parsons]], White invented the [[B-Bender]] device. This device raises the B-string (second string) of the guitar a whole step by the use of pulleys and levers attached to both the upper strap knob and the second string on the guitar. It is activated by pushing down on the neck, and produces a \"[[pedal steel]]\" type sound. [[Arlen Roth]], heavily influenced by this style, did not at the time know that White and Parsons had invented a B-bender, so instead developed his own unique all-finger bending version of this technique. This was heavily documented in his ground-breaking book, \"Nashville Guitar\", all of his recordings, as well as his book \"Masters of the Telecaster\". Subsequently, his [[Telecaster]] sound became as notable as his bluegrass playing. [[Marty Stuart]], another guitarist influenced by White's playing, now owns and regularly plays White's 1954 [[Fender Telecaster]] with the prototype B-Bender.<ref>[http://www.martystuart.com/ZArt-GuitarPlayer8-94.htm] Gill, Chris: \"Steel And Wood, Heart And Soul - The Marty Stuart Guitar Collection,\" reprinted from ''Guitar Player Magazine'', August 1994.</ref>\n\nMusic archivist and writer [[Alec Palao]] has called White \"one of a handful of true greats amongst the instrumentalists of 20th century popular music\", before adding that \"the waves created by the guitarist's idiosyncratic style are still forming ripples within bluegrass, country and rock 'n' roll.\"<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Tuff & Stringy: Sessions 1966-68|chapter=Part One: Sometimes the Journey Can Be as Interesting as the Destination|others=Clarence White|year=2003|last=Palao|first=Alec|page=4|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[Ace Records (United Kingdom)|Ace Records]]|location=London}}</ref>  In 2003, White was ranked No.&nbsp;41 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.

She appeared on national TV shows ''[[Hee Haw]]'', ''[[Nashville Now]]'', ''[[Crook & Chase]]'', and NBC's ''[[Hot Country Nights]]''.\n\nUlisse's debut album ''Trouble at the Door'' charted the singles \"Things Are Mostly Fine\" and \"When Was the Last Time\".<ref name=\"whitburn\"/> The former received a positive review in ''[[Cash Box]]'' magazine which stated that she \"generates a soothing ballad quilted with a powerful force of emotion and inspiration\".<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/90s/1990/CB-1990-12-08.pdf | title=Reviews | journal=Cash Box | pages=22 | date=December 8, 1990}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Atlantic Records in the early 1990\u2019s, Ulisse took some time off and concentrated on song writing, however she did make some appearances. She returned in 2007, this time recording bluegrass music, with a new album ''When I Look Back'' on Hadley Music Group. Ulisse toured with her band The Poor Mountain Boys performing at festivals and concert venues.

In 1931, Jones joined the Pine Ridge String Band, which provided the musical accompaniment for the ''[[Lum and Abner]]'' show. By 1935 his pursuit of a musical career took him to [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]] radio in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], where he met musician/songwriter [[Bradley Kincaid]], who gave him the nickname \"Grandpa Jones\" when he was 22 years old, because of his off-stage grumpiness at early-morning radio shows. Jones liked the name and decided to create a stage persona based around it. Later in life, he lived in [[Mountain View, Arkansas]]. In the 1940s he met rising country radio star [[Cousin Emmy]], from whom he learned to play the [[banjo]].\n\n==Career==\nPerforming as Grandpa Jones, he played the guitar or [[banjo]], [[yodeling|yodeled]], and sang mostly old-time [[ballad]]s. By 1937, Jones had made his way to West Virginia, where [[Cousin Emmy]] taught Jones the art of the [[clawhammer]] style of [[banjo]] playing, which gave a rough backwoods flavor to his performances.<ref name=\"Wadey\">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-grandpa-jones-1147179.html|title=Obituary: Grandpa Jones|last1=Wadey|first1=Paul|date=27 February 1998|access-date=9 January 2018|publisher=Independent}}</ref>  First experience playing music in public came at the age of 11 or thereabouts The music of the WLS Barn Dance in Chicago was a major influence on Louis, as were the [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] records his sister brought home. <!--He won a contest which is featured as singer and host in 1929, \"I won fifty dollars in ten dollar gold pieces, and of course I went right out and brought a better guitar!\" Wonder Hall, \u201cThe Red Headed Music Maker\u201d (famous for \u201cIt Ain\u2019t gonna Rain No More\u201d The winning songs were \u201cGoing Back To Texas\u201d and \u201c My Dear Old Southern Home.\u201d ????

It was there that he met fellow Kentuckian [[Merle Travis]]. In 1943, they made their recording debuts together for [[Syd Nathan]]'s upstart [[King Records (United States)|King Records]].<ref name=\"Encyclopedia\" /> Jones was making records under his own name for King by 1944 and had his first hit with \"It's Raining Here This Morning.\"\n\nHis recording career was put on hold when he enlisted in the United States Army during [[World War II]]. Discharged in 1946, he recorded again for King. Through 1946\u20131949, when he and several Opry cast members ([[Clyde Moody]] and [[Chubby Wise]] among them) were invited to become a part of the burgeoning world of television by Washington D.C. entrepreneur Connie B Gay, he became a cast member at the Old Dominion Barn Dance, broadcast over WRVA in Richmond, Virginia.<ref name=\"Bluegrass\"/> In March 1946, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and started performing on the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. He married Ramona Riggins on October 14, 1946. As an accomplished performer herself, she would take part in his performances. Jones' vaudeville humor was a bridge to television. His more famous songs include \"T For Texas,\" \"Are You From Dixie,\" \"Night Train To Memphis,\" \"[[Good Old Mountain Dew|Mountain Dew]],\" and \"Eight More Miles To Louisville.\"\n\nIn the fall of 1968,<ref name=\"Bluegrass\"/> Jones became a charter cast member on the long-running television show ''[[Hee Haw]]'', often responding to the show's skits with his trademark phrase \"Outrageous.\" He also played banjo, by himself or with banjo player [[David \"Stringbean\" Akeman]]. A musical segment featured in the early years had Jones and \"his lovely wife Ramona\" singing while ringing bells held in their hands and strapped to their ankles. A favorite skit had off-camera cast members ask, \"Hey Grandpa, what's for supper?\" in which he would describe a delicious, country-style meal, often in a rhyming, [[talking blues]] style. Sometimes he would describe something not so good; i.e. \"Because you were bad, thawed out [[TV dinner]]s!\"\n\n==Testimony==\nA resident of rural [[Ridgetop, Tennessee]], outside Nashville, he was a neighbor and friend of fellow musician [[David \"Stringbean\" Akeman]]. On the morning of November 11, 1973, Jones discovered the bodies of Akeman and his wife, Estelle, who had been murdered during the night by robbers.<ref>Cooper, Peter (15 October 2014). \"1973 killings brought fear to Nashville\".

They played one of their first shows at the Station Inn in February 2004 with special guest [[Osborne Brothers|Bobby Osborne]]. The Grascals began recording their first album in 2004, which would simply be a self-titled album on [[Rounder Records]]. This album featured such songs as \"Me and John and Paul\" written by [[Harley Allen]], \"[[Where Corn Don't Grow]]\" and another popular cover song, \"Viva Las Vegas,\" which featured Dolly Parton.  During the recording, [[Dolly Parton]] showed interest in wanting to play with the Grascals.  The band soon became Dolly's opening act, as well as her bluegrass band.<ref name=\"bluegrasstoday.com\"/> Performing at [[Dollywood]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]], the band and Dolly played a cover version of [[Elvis]]'s song, [[Viva Las Vegas (song)|\"Viva Las Vegas.\"]] The [[The grascals (album)|first album]] made it on to the Billboard charts, as well as many country and bluegrass charts.

In addition to singing, he plays guitar, [[fiddle]], [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], [[bouzouki]] and [[mandocello]]. He has released more than ten studio albums, in addition to charting a duet with [[Kathy Mattea]] entitled \"The Battle Hymn of Love\", a No.&nbsp;9 hit on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts in 1990. In November 2013 he was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.\n\n== Early life ==\nTim O'Brien was born on March 16, 1954, and raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], the youngest in a family of five children. At the age of 12, he first heard a [[Bob Dylan]] record, played by his older sister [[Mollie O'Brien|Mollie]], afterwards deciding to take up music.  Throughout his teens, he taught himself to play guitar, [[fiddle|violin]], and [[mandolin]].\n\nIn high school, he and his sister Mollie, a singer, began performing [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]] songs as a duo at church and local coffeehouses.<ref name=\"bio\"/>\n\n== Music career ==\n\n=== Hot Rize ===\n[[File:Hot Rize-by Eric Frommer.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Hot Rize in 2004: [[Pete Wernick]], [[eTown|Nick Forster]], Tim O'Brien, [[Bryan Sutton]]]]\nIn 1973, he dropped out of [[Colby College]] to pursue music professionally.  He wrote to his mother at the time, saying, \"I'm heading west.  I know 200 songs now, and I figure if I keep learning more I should be all right.\"\n\nHe eventually moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], in the 1970s and became part of the music scene there. He played bars around Denver and Boulder with Dan Sadowsky and the Ophelia Swing Band and cut one of his earliest albums, Swing Tunes of the 30's and 40's, with that band in 1977.  In [[Colorado]], he met guitarist/bassist [[Charles Sawtelle]], banjoist [[Pete Wernick]], and guitarist Mike Scap, with whom he formed [[Hot Rize]] in 1978. Mike Scap was soon replaced by Nick Forster on bass with Sawtelle moving to guitar. Over the next twelve years, the quartet earned recognition as one of America's most innovative and entertaining bluegrass bands. Never straying too far from a traditional sound, Hot Rize stood out with fresh harmony singing, Wernick's melodic banjo playing, and O'Brien's easy-going rhythmic drive.\n\nTo broaden their repertoire, the members of Hot Rize would often split their show with a set of classic and offbeat country and western music in the comic guise of Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers.<ref name=\"Official Website\">{{cite web |url=http://www.timobrien.net/bio.cfm |title=Tim O'Brien - Welcome |access-date=February 27, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313073415/http://www.timobrien.net/bio.cfm |archive-date=March 13, 2008 }} Official Website</ref> The band would walk off stage, change clothes, and reappear as a different band (O'Brien assumed the role of \"Red Knuckles\"), with its own songs, fictional back story and humorous costumes. Hot Rize was the International Bluegrass Music Association's first Entertainer of the Year in 1990, and in 1993, O'Brien took the IBMA's Male Vocalist of the Year honors.\n\nIn 1990, Hot Rize disbanded as a regular touring and recording band.  However, after the death of guitarist Charles Sawtelle, in 2002 Hot Rize was joined by award winning guitarist Bryan Sutton and the band began to once again play limited engagements.\n\n=== Duets with Mollie O'Brien ===\n{{Listen\n|filename=OrphanGirl.ogg\n|title=\"Orphan Girl\"\n|description=Sample of \"Orphan Girl\" off ''Away Out on the Mountain'' with Tim and Mollie O'Brien (1994)\n|format=[[Ogg]]}}In 1984, O'Brien and his sister [[Mollie O'Brien]] reunited for a Mother's Day concert, and four years later recorded the duet album ''Take Me Back''.<ref name=\"all\"/> Chip Renner of [[AllMusic]] gave the album 4.5/5 stars, and called it \"a masterpiece.\"<ref name=\"renner\"/> In 1986 they began performing again as an Americana duo, and produced two more albums, ''Remember Me'' (1992), and ''Away Out on the Mountain'' (1994). All three records were released on [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]].<ref name=\"fame\"/>\n\n=== Solo career ===\nO'Brien, who had already recorded several albums without Hot Rize, embarked on a solo career.  He briefly signed to [[RCA Records]], recording an album with them called \"Odd Man In\", before being dropped. [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]] eventually released the album, and O'Brien has not signed to a major since. In 1990, O'Brien also charted along with [[Kathy Mattea]] on the duet \"The Battle Hymn of Love\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;9 on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/|title=Billboard \u2013 Music Charts, News, Photos & Video|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, O'Brien featured prominently on [[Kris Drever]]'s second solo album, ''Mark the Hard Earth''.  He also produced at least one instructional video/DVD of mandolin and bouzouki instruments.\n\nO'Brien joined Mark Knopfler in his Get Lucky Tour between April 8, 2010 and July 31, 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.markknopflersworld.com/get-lucky-tour.html | title=Get Lucky Tour - Mark Knopfler's World }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LdKEZWTCfQM | title=Working for Mark Knopfler | website=[[YouTube]] }}</ref>\n\n=== Howdy Skies Records ===\nO'Brien started his own record label, [[Howdy Skies Records]], in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://timobrien.net/bio |website=Timobrien.net|title=Bio : Tim O'Brien Band (short version) |date=2019| access-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Style and sound ==\n{{blockquote|I wanted to do the whole spectrum of folk music from one guy singing and playing guitar or fiddle to a full band with electric guitar,\" O'Brien said. And that's how the pair (of albums) came out, like folk music bookends. Fiddler's Green tends toward the intimate and traditional, while Cornbread Nation is a bit funkier and tempo-driven. On both, however, old-time tunes sit comfortably next to originals and a few classic country songs by the likes of Jimmie Rodgers and Harlan Howard. I could have taken all traditional songs, but I love stuff like \"California Blues\" and \"Busted,\" which are like folk songs to me, and they fit with the others, and it shows that what is called country music is just another footstep down the same path.

The band seldom had a [[fiddle]] player, but was often asked to play at [[square dance]]s. Following the example of country guitarists [[Grady Martin]] and [[Hank Garland]], Watson taught himself to play fiddle tunes on his [[Gibson Les Paul]] electric guitar.

As popular as ever, Doc and Merle began playing as a trio with [[T. Michael Coleman]] on bass guitar in 1974.

His guitar playing skills, combined with his authenticity as a mountain musician, made him a highly influential figure during the folk music revival. He pioneered a fast and flashy [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] lead guitar style including fiddle tunes and [[crosspicking]] techniques which were adopted and extended by [[Clarence White]], [[Tony Rice]] and many others. Watson was also an accomplished banjo player and sometimes accompanied himself on harmonica as well. Known also for his distinctive and rich [[baritone]] voice, Watson over the years developed a vast repertoire of mountain [[ballad]]s, which he learned via the [[oral tradition]] of his home area in [[Deep Gap, North Carolina]].\n\nWatson played a [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] model D-18 guitar on his earliest recordings. In 1968, Watson began a relationship with Gallagher Guitars when he started playing their G-50 model. His first Gallagher, which Watson referred to as \"Ol' Hoss\", was on display at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] before residing at the Gallagher shop until 2012, when it was auctioned through [[Christie's]] on November 27, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Release: Christie's to Offer a Range of Fine Musical Instruments in November from Italian Masters to Contemporary Classics |url=https://www.christies.com/about-us/press-archive/details?PressReleaseID=5934&lid=1&mob-is-app=false |access-date=2022-07-23 |website=www.christies.com |language=en}}</ref> In 1974, Gallagher created a customized G-50 line to meet Watson's preferred specifications, which bears the Doc Watson name. In 1991, Gallagher customized a personal [[Cutaway (guitar)|cutaway]] guitar for Watson that he played until his death and which he referred to as \"Donald\" in honor of Gallagher guitar's second-generation proprietor and builder, Don Gallagher.<ref name=\"callow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gallagherguitar.com/flatpickart.html|title=Gallagher Guitars|last=Callow|first=John|date=January 1997|publisher=Flatpicking Guitar Magazine, Vol 1, No 2|work=flatpick.com|access-date=2008-11-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108001406/http://www.gallagherguitar.com/flatpickart.html|archive-date=November 8, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> During his last years, Watson played a [[Dana Bourgeois]] [[Dreadnought (guitar type)|dreadnought]] given to him by [[Ricky Skaggs]] for his 80th birthday. Another of Watson's favorites was his Arnold guitar, \"The Jimmie\", built by luthier John Arnold as a tribute to the famous 1926 Martin 00-18 played by [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].\n\nIn 1994, Watson teamed with musicians [[Randy Scruggs]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] to contribute the classic song \"[[Keep on the Sunny Side]]\" to the AIDS benefit album [[Red Hot + Country]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Merlewatson.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Merle Watson, c. 1979]]\n\nIn his later life, Watson scaled back his touring schedule. He was generally joined onstage by his grandson (Merle's son) Richard, as well as longtime musical partners [[David Holt (musician)|David Holt]] or [[Jack Lawrence (bluegrass)|Jack Lawrence]]. On June 19, 2007, Watson was accompanied by Australian guitar player [[Tommy Emmanuel]] at a concert at the [[Bass Performance Hall]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].

When he was two, his family started going to That Pizza Place, where he listened to John Moore's band Bluegrass Etc. When Thile was four, his family moved to [[Idyllwild, California]].\n\nThile began playing the mandolin at the age of five, taking occasional lessons from John Moore. At age eight, Thile's family and the Watkins family formed [[Nickel Creek]]. The band performed at many California bluegrass festivals, and as a result Chris had to be [[homeschooling|home-schooled]]. At age twelve, he won the mandolin championship at the [[Walnut Valley Festival]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]].\n\nThat same year, 1993, Thile made a demo tape and sent it to the Sugar Hill and Rounder record labels.

During his career, he released only two albums but charted 12 singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts, and 7 more after his death.\n\nBorn in [[Ashland, Kentucky]], Whitley grew up in nearby [[Sandy Hook, Kentucky]]. He began his career there in 1970, performing in [[Ralph Stanley]]'s band. Establishing himself as a lead singer in bluegrass music, Whitley moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1983 and began his recording career there. His first Top 20 Country Hit single, \"[[Miami, My Amy]]\", was released in 1986. In 1988, his first three singles from his studio album ''[[Don't Close Your Eyes (album)|Don't Close Your Eyes]]'', the [[Don't Close Your Eyes (Keith Whitley song)|title song]], \"[[When You Say Nothing at All]]\" and \"[[I'm No Stranger to the Rain]]\" were number one hits. Years of alcoholism severely compromised his health and he died of alcohol intoxication in 1989 at his Goodlettsville home at the age of 34. His later singles, \"[[I Wonder Do You Think of Me (song)|I Wonder Do You Think of Me]]\",  \"[[It Ain't Nothin']]\", and \"[[I'm Over You (Keith Whitley song)|I'm Over You]]\", were released after his death.\n\nIn 2022, Whitley was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]].<ref name=\"cmhof\">{{cite web | url=https://eu.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2022/05/17/country-music-hall-fame-class-2022-inductees/9805843002/ | title=Keith Whitley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Joe Galante are headed to the Country Music Hall of Fame }}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nWhitley was born to Faye Ferguson (editor of ''The Elliott County News'') and Elmer Whitley (an electrician) in [[Ashland, Kentucky]], but was raised 46 miles away in [[Sandy Hook, Kentucky|Sandy Hook]], and attended Sandy Hook High School.<ref name=HicksJ-TKP-1991-09-25>Hicks, Jack. \u2013 \"Singer Keith Whitley's Memory Alive Through Songs, Love in Home Town\". \u2013 ''[[The Cincinnati Post|The Kentucky Post]]''. \u2013 September 25, 1991.</ref><ref name=LH-L-1989-05-10>\"Country Music Star Keith Whitley Dead at 33\". \u2013 ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]''. \u2013 May 10, 1989.</ref> He had two brothers, Randy and Dwight, and a sister, Mary.<ref name=LockwoodFE-LH-L-1998-06-27>Lockwood, Frank E. \u2013 \"Bikers, Sandy Hook Pay Tribute to Favorite Son\". \u2013 Lexington Herald-Leader (KY) \u2013 Saturday, June 27, 1998.</ref><ref name=LockwoodFE-LH-L-1999-06-28>Lockwood, Frank E. \u2013 \"Singing in Rain\". \u2013 Lexington Herald-Leader (KY) \u2013 Saturday, June 28, 1999.</ref> The Whitley family is of [[English Americans|English]] and [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots-Irish]] descent and has lived in the [[Elliott County, Kentucky|Elliott County]] area since the 1840s.\n\nWhile Whitley was a teenager in Sandy Hook, he and his friends would pass the time drinking [[Rum-running|bootleg]] [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] and racing their cars down mountain roads at dangerous speeds. Whitley was once in a car whose driver attempted to round a curve at {{convert|120|mph|kph}}. The car wrecked, killing his friend and almost breaking Whitley's neck. In another incident, he drove his car off a {{convert|120|ft|m|adj=on}} cliff into a frozen river, escaping with only a broken [[collar bone]].<ref name=AP>Associated Press \u2013 \"Whitley Just Getting Started Despite 18-Year Music Career\". \u2013 Salina Journal (KS) \u2013 Thursday, October 27, 1988.</ref>\n\nWhitley's older brother Randy was killed in an October 1983 motorcycle accident.<ref name=\"HicksJ-TKP-1991-09-25\" /><ref name=\"LockwoodFE-LH-L-1998-06-27\" />\n\n==Musical career==\nWhitley is known for his neotraditional brand of country popularized by hit artists such as [[George Strait]] and [[Randy Travis]].\n\nIn 1969, he performed in a musical contest in [[Ezel, Kentucky]], with brother Dwight on five-string banjo. [[Ricky Skaggs]] was also in the contest. Skaggs and Whitley instantly bonded and subsequently became close friends.<ref name=RoweN-RT-D-1986-04-20>Rowe, Norman. \u2013 Album Echoes Country Classics\". \u2013 ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''. \u2013 April 20, 1986</ref>\n\nWhitley and Skaggs, both sixteen years old, were discovered in Ft. Gay, West Virginia, by [[Ralph Stanley]], who was 45 minutes late for a gig due to a flat tire.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Stanley opened the door of the club and heard what he thought was the [[Stanley Brothers]] playing on a jukebox. However, it was Whitley and Skaggs, who \"sounded just like me and Carter in the early days\".{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The two soon joined Stanley's band. Whitley became lead singer for Stanley in 1974.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Whitley also played with [[J.D. Crowe & the New South]] in the mid-1970s.<ref name=AP/> During this period, he established himself as one of the most versatile and talented lead singers in bluegrass. His singing was heavily influenced by [[Carter Stanley]] and [[Lefty Frizzell]]. He moved to [[Nashville]] in 1983 to pursue a country music career and soon signed a record deal with [[RCA Records]].<ref name=AP/>\n\nWhitley's first solo album, ''A Hard Act to Follow'', was released in 1984, and featured a more mainstream country style. While Whitley was working hard to achieve his own style, the songs he produced were inconsistent. Critics regarded the album as too erratic. Whitley honed his sound within the next few years for his next album, ''L.A. to Miami''.\n\n''L.A. to Miami'', released in 1985, would give him his first Top 20 country hit single, \"Miami, My Amy\". The song was followed by three more hit songs: \"Ten Feet Away\", \"Homecoming '63\", and \"Hard Livin'\", The album also included \"[[On the Other Hand]]\" and \"[[Nobody in His Right Mind Would've Left Her]]\". \"On the Other Hand\" was pitched to Whitley before [[Randy Travis]] released the song as a single and when Whitley's version wasn't released as a single, Travis released his in 1986, as did [[George Strait]] with \"Nobody in His Right Mind Would've Left Her\".\n\nDuring his tour to promote ''L.A. to Miami'', he met and began a romantic relationship with country singer [[Lorrie Morgan]]. They were married in November 1986 and  had their only child, a son, Jesse Keith Whitley in June 1987. Whitley also adopted Lorrie's daughter, Morgan, from her first marriage.\n\nDuring the new recording sessions in 1987, Whitley began feeling that the songs he was  were not up to his standards, so he approached RCA and asked if the project of 15 songs could be shelved. He also asked if he could take a major role in creating the songs and in production. The new album, titled ''[[Don't Close Your Eyes (album)|Don't Close Your Eyes]]'', was released in 1988, and the album sold extremely well. The album contained one of the many songs that Whitley had a hand in writing in his years at Tree Publishing, \"It's All Coming Back to Me Now\". On the album was a remake of [[Lefty Frizzell]]'s classic standard \"I Never Go Around Mirrors,\" and the song became a huge hit at Whitley's concerts. The first three singles from the album\u2014\"When You Say Nothing at All,\" \"I'm No Stranger to the Rain,\" and the title cut\u2014all reached No. 1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s country charts during the autumn of 1988 and the winter of 1989, with the title track \"Don't Close Your Eyes\" being ranked as ''Billboard''\u2019s No. 1 Country song of 1988. Shortly thereafter, \"I'm No Stranger to the Rain\" also earned Whitley his first and only [[Country Music Association]] award as a solo artist and a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance|Best Country Vocal Performance, Male]].\n\nIn early 1989, Whitley approached RCA chairman [[Joe Galante]] with the intention of releasing \"I Never Go Around Mirrors\" as a single. Galante approved of the musical flexibility that Whitley achieved with the song; however, he suggested that Whitley record something new and more upbeat. The result was a song Whitley had optioned for his previous album called ''[[I Wonder Do You Think of Me]]'', and was to result in his next album release.\n\nWhitley was scheduled to be invited to join the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in late May 1989. He was posthumously inducted as a former member on October 14, 2023, in a tribute concert held during that night's ''Opry'' broadcast.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Keith Whitley to be celebrated by Garth Brooks, more, at October Opry event |url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/09/15/keith-whitley-to-be-celebrated-by-garth-brooks-more-at-october-opry-event/70863977007/ |access-date=2023-10-15 |website=The Tennessean |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nOn May 9, 1989, Whitley had a brief phone call with his mother and was later visited by his brother-in-law, Lane Palmer.  The two had coffee and were planning a day of golf and lunch, after which Whitley planned to start writing songs for him and Lorrie Morgan to record when she returned from her concert tour. Palmer left at approximately {{nowrap|8:30 a.m.}},<ref name=JinkinsS-FWST-1997-10-14>Jinkins, Shirley. \u2013 \"A country music love story of death, drinking and devotion\". \u2013 ''[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]]''. \u2013 October 14, 1997.</ref> asking Whitley to be ready to leave within an hour. Upon returning, Palmer found Whitley unresponsive on his bed and called an ambulance. Whitley was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. He was 34.\n\nThe official cause of death was acute ethanolism ([[alcohol poisoning]]).<ref name=LH-L-1989-05-10 /> [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] Medical Examiner Charles Harlan stated that Whitley's blood alcohol level was 0.47 (the equivalent of 20 one-ounce shots of 100-[[proof (alcohol)|proof]] whiskey).<ref>\"Alcohol Cuts Short a promising career\". \u2013 [[Associated Press]]. \u2013 (c/o ''[[Salina Journal]]''). \u2013 August 10, 1989.</ref><ref>Edwards, Joe. \u2013 \"Keith Whitley discovered dead \u2013 Alcohol overdose cause of death\". \u2013 ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''. \u2013 May 10, 1989.</ref><ref name=AP-CT-1989-05-10>\"Country Singer Keith Whitley, 33\". \u2013 [[Associated Press]]. \u2013 (c/o ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''). \u2013 May 10, 1989.</ref><ref>Hurst, Jack. \u2013 \"Whitley's Last Days\". \u2013 ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. \u2013 May 14, 1989.</ref><ref>Green, Barbara. \u2013 \"Whitley Fans Hate 'To See a Good Man Go To Waste\". \u2013 ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''. \u2013 May 17, 1989.</ref> He was born in 1954 per his birth certificate and passport, but RCA and his [[Headstone|grave marker]] erroneously recorded his birth year as 1955.<ref name=WhitburnJ-TBBofT40CH-p382>Whitburn, Joel (2006). \u2013 ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country Hits''. \u2013 Second Edition. \u2013 New York: Billboard Books. \u2013 p.382. \u2013 {{ISBN|978-0-8230-8291-9}}.</ref><ref name=\"Birth-Year\">Stambler, Irwin, and Grelun Landon (2000). \u2013 ''Country Music: The Encyclopedia''. \u2013 New York: St. Martin's Press. \u2013 p.533. \u2013 {{ISBN|978-0-312-26487-1}}.<br />\u2014Carlin, Richard (2003). \u2013 ''Country Music: A Biographical Dictionary''. \u2013 New York: Routledge \u2013 p.427. \u2013 {{ISBN|978-0-415-93802-0}}.<br />\u2014Larkin, Colin (1995). \u2013 ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music''. \u2013 New York: Stockton Press \u2013 P.4462. \u2013 {{ISBN|978-0-85112-662-3}}.<br />\u2014Stanton, Scott (2003). \u2013 ''The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians''. \u2013 New York: Pocket Books. \u2013 p.395. \u2013 {{ISBN|978-0-7434-6330-0}}.<br />\u2014Hicks, Jack. \u2013 \"Singer Keith Whitley's Memory Alive Through Songs, Love in Home Town\". \u2013 ''[[The Cincinnati Post|The Kentucky Post]]''. \u2013 September 25, 1991.<br />\u2014\"Country Music Star Keith Whitley Dead at 33\". \u2013 ''[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]''. \u2013 May 10, 1989.<br />\u2014Hurst, Jack. \u2013 \"Whitley's Last Days\". \u2013 ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. \u2013 May 14, 1989.<br />\u2014\"Alcohol Kills Country Singer Keith Whitley\". \u2013 [[United Press International]]. \u2013 (c/o ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]''). \u2013 May 10, 1989.</ref>\n\nThe day after his death, [[Music Row]] was lined with black ribbons in memory of Whitley. He is buried in the [[Spring Hill Cemetery (Nashville)|Spring Hill Cemetery]] outside [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. His gravestone reads, \"Forever yours faithfully\" (part one) and \"His being was my reason\" (part two).\n\n==Posthumous releases==\nAt the time of his death, Whitley had just finished work on his third and final studio album, ''[[I Wonder Do You Think of Me]]''. The album was released three months after his death, on August 1, 1989. The album produced two more No.&nbsp;1 hits, with the title track and \"It Ain't Nothin'.\" \"I'm Over You\" also was in the Top 5 in early 1990, reaching No. 3.\n\nTwo new songs were added to \"Greatest Hits\": The first, \"Tell Lorrie I Love Her\" was written and recorded at home by Whitley for Morgan, originally intended as a work tape for Whitley's friend Curtis 'Mr. Harmony' Young to sing at Whitley's wedding. The second was \"'Til a Tear Becomes a Rose\", a 1987 demo taken from Tree that originally featured harmony vocals by childhood friend Ricky Skaggs. Lorrie Morgan, with creative control and license to Whitley's namesake, recorded her voice alongside Whitley's, and released it as a single, which rose to No. 13 and won them 1990's CMA award for Best Vocal Collaboration as well as a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Vocal Collaboration]].\n\nRCA also released a compilation of performance clips (from his days in the Ralph Stanley-Fronted Clinch Mountain Boys), interviews, and some previously unreleased material under the title \"Kentucky Bluebird\". The album produced hits for Whitley as well, including a duet with [[Earl Thomas Conley]], named \"Brotherly Love,\" which peaked at No. 2 in late 1991 and gave Whitley his second consecutive posthumous Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals|Best Country Vocal Collaboration]].\n\nIn 1994, Whitley's widow, Lorrie Morgan, organized several of Whitley's friends in bluegrass and some of the big names in country at the time to record a [[tribute]] album to Whitley. The album, ''[[Keith Whitley: A Tribute Album]]'', was released in September 1994 via BNA. It included covers of Whitley's songs from artists such as [[Alan Jackson]], [[Diamond Rio]], and Ricky Skaggs. The album also included four previously unreleased tracks recorded by Whitley in 1987, one of which had Morgan dubbed in as a duet partner. The album also included two original songs: \"Little Boy Lost\", co-written and sung by [[Daron Norwood]], and \"A Voice Still Rings True\", a multi-artist song.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/1994/08/11/crowning-touch-3/|title=Crowning Touch 'Red Hot + Country' Album Delayed To Include Crosby, Stills And Nash|last=Hurst|first=Jack|date=August 11, 1994|work=[[The Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=February 17, 2014}}</ref> [[Alison Krauss]]'s rendition of \"When You Say Nothing at All\" was released as a single from the album, reaching number 3 on the country charts in 1995.\n\nIn 1995, the album ''Wherever You Are Tonight'' was released, produced by Lorrie Morgan, featuring restored demos of 1986\u20131988, with crisper 1990s recording techniques and a full orchestra. The album and single of the same name both did very well on the Billboard and R&R charts and \"Super Hits\" and \"The Essential Keith Whitley\" followed in 1996. \"The Essential\" contained the remastered and long since unavailable LP and Whitley's debut, the 6-Track \"A Hard Act to Follow\", and a scrapped song from 1986's \"LA to Miami\", \"I Wonder Where You Are Tonight\".\n\n==Legacy==\nSeveral film projects depicting Whitley's life were slated, but none have come to fruition. One idea was a film version of the George Vescey-Lorrie Morgan-penned ''Forever Yours, Faithfully''. While Morgan's book was a benchmark in piecing together Whitley's final moments, perhaps the most research went into a project titled ''Kentucky Bluebird'', which was to star writer/actor/director [[David L. Keith|David Keith]]. This project was in [[development hell]] for several years, and was halted in late 2006 after difficulties with casting and funding. Another film project, started in 2004 by songwriter Jeff Swope, was a biopic chronicling Whitley's life and passing. The last information about the project came in 2010, when he announced that pre-production was set to begin, pending investors.<ref>Mirrors, The Keith Whitley Story \u2013 [[WordPress]], April 13, 2010</ref>\n\nDespite his brief moment in the spotlight, Whitley's legacy remains.<ref name=\"Watts 2019 m180\">{{cite web | last=Watts | first=Cindy | title=Keith Whitley's family remembers him on 30th anniversary of his death | website=The Tennessean | date=May 8, 2019 | url=https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/2019/05/08/keith-whitley-country-music-hall-of-fame-exhibit-lorrie-morgan/1141495001/ | access-date=September 7, 2023}}</ref><ref name=\"Morris 2009 u881\">{{cite web | last=Morris | first=<!-- -->Edward | title=Keith Whitley's Musical Legacy Endures Two Decades After His Death | website=CMT | date=May 8, 2009 | url=https://www.cmt.com/news/ijbw6b/keith-whitleys-musical-legacy-endures-two-decades-after-his-death | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221206210924/https://www.cmt.com/news/ijbw6b/keith-whitleys-musical-legacy-endures-two-decades-after-his-death | url-status=dead | archive-date=December 6, 2022 | access-date=September 7, 2023}}</ref> He was inducted into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 2022;<ref name=\"cmhof\"/> prior to that, he was the subject of an exhibit detailing his life and legacy.<ref name=\"Hall 2019 z408\">{{cite web | last=Hall | first=Kristin M. | title=New exhibit shows Keith Whitley's tragic, but lasting legacy | website=The Seattle Times | date=May 3, 2019 | url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/new-exhibit-shows-keith-whitleys-tragic-but-lasting-legacy/ | access-date=September 7, 2023}}</ref> Whitley retains a persistent influence on country artists, including [[Tim McGraw]], [[Ronnie Dunn]], and [[Dierks Bentley]].<ref name=\"Roland Roland 2014 w795\">{{cite magazine | last=Roland | first=Tom | title=How Keith Whitley's Conflicted Legacy Spawned an 'Authentic' Country Revival | magazine=Billboard | date=May 6, 2014 | url=https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/keith-whitley-jake-worthington-the-voice-country-authentic-6077549/ | access-date=September 7, 2023}}</ref> Newer artists like [[Morgan Wallen]] are among his progenitors; a song named after Whitley features on Wallen's 2023 double album, ''[[One Thing at a Time]]'',<ref name=\"Nicholson Nicholson 2023 p810\">{{cite magazine | last=Nicholson | first=Jessica | title=Morgan Wallen Celebrates New Album 'One Thing at a Time' For a Packed House in Nashville | magazine=Billboard | date=March 4, 2023 | url=https://www.billboard.com/music/country/morgan-wallen-one-thing-at-a-time-album-nashville-concert-review-1235279928/ | access-date=September 7, 2023}}</ref> which won the approval of Whitley's widow and son.<ref name=\"Country Now 2023 r033\">{{cite web | title=Lorrie Morgan and Jesse Keith Whitley React To Morgan Wallen's New Song That Tributes Keith Whitley | website=Country Now | date=January 12, 2023 | url=https://countrynow.com/lorrie-morgan-and-jesse-keith-whitley-react-to-morgan-wallens-new-song-that-tributes-keith-whitley/ | access-date=September 7, 2023}}</ref>\n\nWhitley is the only person to be posthumously recognized as a former member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]], without ever being an active member. Management had scheduled Whitley for an appearance in late May 1989, where he was to be invited to join, but his death on May 9 interrupted those plans. As the Opry has a policy only inducting living artists as members, Whitley's induction was scrapped. During a Keith Whitley tribute show at the Opry on October 14, 2023, [[Garth Brooks]] and [[Lorrie Morgan]] announced that Whitley's name would be engraved on a plaque and included in the Opry's Member Gallery backstage, alongside every act who has held Opry membership at some point in the show's history, dating to 1925.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Keith Whitley discography}}\n*1984: ''[[A

Though probably best known for his fluid renditions of classic fiddle tunes transcribed for the guitar (\"Fiddler's Dram/Whiskey Before Breakfast\"), Blake has also written songs that have become bluegrass and folk standards, such as \"Ginseng Sullivan\", \"Slow Train through Georgia\", \"Billy Gray\", and \"Church Street Blues\".\n\nBlake has also written and published songs of a political nature, such as \"Don\u2019t Be Afraid of the Neo-Cons.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBlake is known for his tastefully simple-sounding style, saying, \"I\u2019m more interested in the music and the tone than I am the licks.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |last=Campbell |first=Phil |date=2007-11-21 |title=Interview: Norman Blake |url=https://www.fretboardjournal.com/features/interview-norman-blake/ |access-date=2022-11-28 |website=Fretboard Journal |language=en}}</ref>\n\nAlthough known as one of the most prominent steel-string guitar [[flatpicking|flatpickers]], Blake is a multi-instrumentalist and vocalist. Other instruments he plays include the [[mandolin]], [[Guitjo (six-string)|6-string banjo]], [[fiddle]], [[dobro]], [[banjo]] and [[viola]].<ref>CD liner notes from ''The Fields of November'', Flying Fish Records, 1992</ref> He is known for his loose, right-hand guitar technique, which arose out of his mandolin technique.

The group was founded as a side project by record producer and session musician Scott Rouse in 1987, after he began experimenting with dance mixes of bluegrass and country songs, eventually applying the term groovegrass to his mix of music. He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and joined several other country musicians and funk bass guitarist [[Bootsy Collins]], releasing a country version of [[Los del R\u00edo]]'s \"[[Macarena]]\" and two albums. The country cover of \"Macarena\" charted on both the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]], and was the group's only chart entry.\n\n==History==\nRouse, a [[session musician]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], first came up with the idea of GrooveGrass in the mid-1980s when he began experimenting with dance mixes of bluegrass songs such as [[Alton Delmore]]'s \"Deep River Blues\". His mixes became popular at local clubs, eventually leading to one disc jockey terming the blend of music \"groovegrass\".<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p350665/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=GrooveGrass biography |accessdate=2008-08-21 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>\n\nRouse then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], at the request of his friend, musician [[Doc Watson]].

Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo artist after Carter's death, from 1967 until his own death in 2016.\n\n==Early lives==\nCarter and Ralph Stanley were born on a small farm in [[Dickenson County, Virginia]]. Music was a part of their lives even in their early years, and they listened to the [[Bill Monroe|Monroe Brothers]], [[J. E. Mainer|J.&nbsp;E. Mainer's Mountaineers]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on local radio.\n\n==Careers==\nThe brothers formed a band, the Lazy Ramblers, and performed as a duo on [[WJCW|WJHL]] radio in Johnson City, Tennessee.<ref name=\"country_music\">{{cite book |title= Country Music: The Encyclopedia| edition= 3rd |last= Stambler|first= Irwin|author2=Grelun Landon |year= 2000|publisher= St. Martin's Press|location= New York|isbn= 0-312-26487-9|pages= 457\u20138|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C|access-date= February 6, 2010}}</ref> World War II interrupted their musical career, but once both brothers returned from the United States Army, they resumed their musical pursuits.

Additional members of this early band were [[Pee Wee Lambert|Darrell \"Pee Wee\" Lambert]] on [[mandolin]] and Bobby Sumner on [[fiddle]]. Sumner soon was replaced by [[Leslie Keith]].<ref name=r80>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;80.</ref>\n\nOn December 26, 1946, the band began performing at radio station [[WZAP|WCYB]] in Bristol, Tennessee as stalwarts of the famed ''Farm and Fun Time'' radio show.<ref name=w3>Wright 1995, p.&nbsp;3.</ref> They made their recording debut in September 1947 for [[Rich-R-Tone Records]] which had been founded the year before. Their records sold well, \"outselling even [[Eddy Arnold]]\" regionally.<ref name=r82>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;82.</ref> Up to now, Ralph had been playing his banjo with two fingers on recordings and in concerts, but in 1948, he switched to the three-finger style (popularised by [[Earl Scruggs]]).<ref name=r84>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;84.</ref> In March 1949, the Stanley Brothers began recording for [[Columbia Records]].<ref name=r87>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;87.</ref> During this time, [[Bill Monroe]] was not particularly fond of groups like the Stanley Brothers and [[Flatt & Scruggs]] who he believed \"stole\" his music by copying it; they were seen as \"economic threats.\"<ref name=s88>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;88.</ref><ref name=r85>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;85.</ref>\n\nFinancially hard times in the early 1950s forced the brothers to take a short break in their musical career. They began working for the [[Ford Motor Company]] in Detroit. Eventually, Monroe and the Stanley Brothers became friends, and Carter performed for several months with Bill Monroe in the summer of 1951. In August 1951, Ralph was involved in a serious automobile accident that almost ended his career.<ref name=w4>Wright 1995, p.&nbsp;4.</ref> Following his recovery, Carter and Ralph reunited to front their Clinch Mountain Boys.\n\nAs bluegrass music grew less popular in the late 1950s, the Stanley Brothers moved to Live Oak, Florida and headlined the weekly ''Suwannee River Jamboree'' radio show on [[WQHL (AM)|WNER]] from 1958 to 1962. The three-hour show was also syndicated across the Southeast.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Folklife Database: Recording of the Suwannee River Jamboree radio program\n| work = floridamemory.com\n| publisher = State Library and Archives of Florida\n| url = http://www.floridamemory.com/Collections/folklife/profile.cfm?idsThing=4476\n| access-date = 2009-05-20}}\n\n</ref> In 1966, the brothers toured Europe, and upon returning home, they continued to perform together until Carter's death in December 1966.<ref name=w5>Wright 1995, p.&nbsp;5.</ref>\n\nMany years later, Ralph revived the Clinch Mountain Boys until his death in 2016. He performed with them through 2013. He recorded one last album in 2014, ''Side By Side'', with his son, Ralph II. Among the musicians who have played in the revived Clinch Mountain Boys were [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Keith Whitley]], [[Larry Sparks]], [[Curly Ray Cline]], Jack Cooke, Roy Lee Centers, Charlie Sizemore, Ray Goins, and Ralph Stanley II. Ralph's career received a big boost with his prominent role on the very successful soundtrack recording of the 2000 feature film, ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'', which featured the song \"[[Man of Constant Sorrow]]\" among others.\n\n==Legacy==\nThe Stanley Brothers were inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]] in 1992. In 2005, The Barter State Theatre of Virginia premiered an original stage production, ''Man of Constant Sorrow: The Story of the Stanley Brothers'', written by Dr. Douglas Pote.\n\nThe University Press of Mississippi published the first full-length biography of the Stanley Brothers, ''Lonesome Melodies: The Lives and Music of the Stanley Brothers'' by David W.

He described the genre as \"Scottish [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and [[jazz]], and it has a high lonesome sound.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bill Monroe |website=2022 Monroe Mandolin Camp |url=https://monroemandolincamp.com/bill-monroe/ |access-date=2022-11-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nMonroe was born on [[Bill Monroe Farm|his family's farm]] near [[Rosine, Kentucky]], the youngest of eight children of James Buchanan \"Buck\" and Malissa (Vandiver) Monroe. His mother and her brother, [[Pendleton Vandiver|James Pendleton \"Pen\" Vandiver]], were both musically talented, and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at home.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nBill was of [[Scottish Americans|Scottish]] and [[English Americans|English]] heritage. Because his older brothers Birch and [[Charlie Monroe|Charlie]] already played the [[fiddle]] and [[guitar]], Bill was resigned to playing the less desirable [[mandolin]].<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> He recalled that his brothers insisted that he remove four of the mandolin's eight strings so he would not play too loudly.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nMonroe's mother died when he was ten, and his father died six years later.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Eventually, his brothers and sisters moved away, leaving Monroe to bounce between uncles and aunts until finally settling in with his disabled uncle Pendleton Vandiver, whom he often accompanied when Vandiver played the fiddle at dances. This experience inspired one of Monroe's most famous compositions, \"Uncle Pen\", recorded in 1950,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> and the 1972 album ''Bill Monroe's Uncle Pen.'' On that album, Monroe recorded a number of traditional fiddle tunes he had often heard performed by Vandiver. Vandiver has been credited with giving Monroe \"a repertoire of tunes that sank into Bill's aurally trained memory and a sense of rhythm that seeped into his bones.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith |first=Richard D. |url=https://archive.org/details/cantyouhearmecal00smit/ |title=Can't You Hear Me Callin': the Life of Bill Monroe, Father of Bluegrass |date= |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-316-80381-6 |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |page=27 |language=en |oclc=42690222 |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nAlso significant in Monroe's musical life was [[Arnold Shultz]], an influential [[fiddle]]r and guitarist who introduced Monroe to the [[blues]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Bluegrass Breakdown: The Making of the Old Southern Sound|author=Robert Cantwell|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|date=2003|isbn=9780252071171|pages=30\u201332}}</ref><ref>''The Father of Bluegrass Music'', DVD Documentary (1993)</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nIn 1929, Monroe moved to [[Indiana]] to work at an oil refinery with his brothers [[Birch Monroe|Birch]] and Charlie.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Together with a friend, Larry Moore, they formed the \"Monroe Brothers\", to play at local dances and house parties.\n\nBirch and Moore soon left the group, and Bill and Charlie carried on as a duo, eventually winning spots performing live on radio stations, first in Indiana and then, sponsored by Texas Crystals, on several radio broadcasts in [[Shenandoah, Iowa]], [[Nebraska]], [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]] from 1934 to 1936.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> [[RCA Records#Previous labels|RCA Victor]] signed the Monroe Brothers to a recording contract in 1936.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> They scored an immediate hit single with the gospel song \"What Would You Give in Exchange For Your Soul?\" and ultimately recorded 60 tracks for Victor's [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label between 1936 and 1938.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Monroe: American Musician|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Monroe|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=January 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Monroe Brothers disbanded in 1938, Bill Monroe formed The Kentuckians in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], but the group only lasted for three months.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Monroe then left Little Rock for [[Atlanta, Georgia]], to form the first edition of the Blue Grass Boys,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> with singer/guitarist [[Cleo Davis]], fiddler Art Wooten, and bassist [[Amos Garren]].\n\nIn October 1939, Monroe successfully auditioned for a regular spot on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], impressing Opry founder [[George D. Hay]] with his energetic performance of [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]'s \"[[Mule Skinner Blues]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Monroe recorded that song, along with seven others, at his first solo recording session for RCA Victor in 1940; by this time, the Blue Grass Boys consisted of singer/guitarist [[Clyde Moody]], fiddler Tommy Magness, and bassist Bill Wesbrooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://doodah.net/bgb/|title=Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys|website=Doodah.net|access-date=January 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile the fast tempos and instrumental virtuosity characteristic of bluegrass music are apparent even on these early tracks, Monroe was still experimenting with the sound of his group. He seldom sang lead vocals on his Victor recordings, often preferring to contribute high tenor harmonies as he had in the Monroe Brothers. A 1945 session for [[Columbia Records]] featured an [[accordion]], soon dropped from the band. Most importantly, Monroe added [[banjo]] player [[David \"Stringbean\" Akeman]] to the Blue Grass Boys in 1942.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Akeman played the instrument in a relatively primitive style and was rarely featured in instrumental solos. Monroe's pre-1946 recordings represent a transitional style between the [[string band|string-band tradition]] from which he came and the musical innovation to follow.\n\n== \"Original Bluegrass Band\" and Monroe's heyday as a star ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2022}}\nKey developments occurred in Monroe's music with the addition of [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] to the Blue Grass Boys in December 1945.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Flatt played a solid rhythm guitar style that would help to set the course for bluegrass timing. Scruggs played the banjo with a distinctive three-finger picking style that immediately caused a sensation among Opry audiences. Flatt and Scruggs joined a highly accomplished group that included fiddler Howdy Forrester and bassist Joe Forrester and would soon include fiddler [[Chubby Wise]] and bassist [[Howard Watts]], who often performed under the name \"Cedric Rainwater\".\n\nIn retrospect, this line-up of the Blue Grass Boys has been dubbed the \"Original Bluegrass Band\", as the music finally included all the elements that characterize bluegrass music, including breakneck tempos, sophisticated vocal harmony arrangements, and impressive instrumental proficiency demonstrated in solos or \"breaks\" on the mandolin, banjo, and fiddle. By this time, Monroe had acquired the 1923 Gibson F5 model \"Lloyd Loar\" mandolin, which became his trademark instrument for the remainder of his career.<ref>Rosenberg, Neil V. (2005). ''BLUEGRASS: A History''. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press; {{ISBN|0-252-07245-6}}</ref>\n\nThe 28 songs recorded by this version of the Blue Grass Boys for Columbia Records in 1946 and 1947 soon became classics of the genre, including \"Toy Heart\", \"Blue Grass Breakdown\", \"[[Molly and Tenbrooks]]\", \"Wicked Path of Sin\", \"My Rose of Old Kentucky\", \"Little Cabin Home on the Hill\", and Monroe's most famous song \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> which was recorded by [[Elvis Presley]] in 1954, appearing as the B-side of his first single for [[Sun Records]]. Monroe gave his blessing to Presley's [[rock and roll]] cover of the song, originally a slow [[ballad]] in [[waltz]] time, and re-recorded it himself with a faster arrangement after Presley's version became a hit.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Several gospel-themed numbers are credited to the \"Blue Grass Quartet\", which featured four-part vocal arrangements accompanied solely by mandolin and guitar \u2013 Monroe's usual practice when performing \"sacred\" songs.\n\nBoth Flatt and Scruggs left Monroe's band in early 1948, soon forming their own group, the [[Foggy Mountain Boys]]. In 1949, after signing with Decca Records, Monroe entered what has been called the \"golden age\" of his career<ref>''Bill Monroe and Bluegrass'' by Roughstock staff, January 27, 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.roughstock.com/history/bill-monroe-and-bluegrass/ |title=Roughstock's History of Country Music - Bill Monroe and Bluegrass |access-date=June 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620032558/http://www.roughstock.com/history/bill-monroe-and-bluegrass/ |archive-date=June 20, 2009  }}</ref> with what many consider the classic \"high lonesome\" version of the Blue Grass Boys, featuring the lead vocals and rhythm guitar of [[Jimmy Martin]], the banjo of [[Rudy Lyle]] (replacing [[Don Reno]]), and fiddlers such as Merle \"Red\" Taylor, [[Charlie Cline]], [[Bobby Hicks]], and [[Vassar Clements]].\n\nThis band recorded a number of bluegrass classics, including \"My Little Georgia Rose\", \"On and On\", \"Memories of Mother and Dad\", and \"Uncle Pen\", as well as instrumentals such as \"Roanoke\", \"Big Mon\", \"Stoney Lonesome\", \"Get Up John\", and the mandolin feature \"Raw Hide\". [[Carter Stanley]] joined the Blue Grass Boys as guitarist for a short time in 1951 during a period when [[The Stanley Brothers]] had temporarily disbanded.\n\nOn January 16, 1953, Monroe was critically injured in a two-car wreck.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> He and \"Bluegrass Boys\" bass player, [[Bessie Lee Mauldin]], were returning home from a fox hunt north of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. On highway 31-W, near White House, their car was struck by a drunken driver. Monroe, who had suffered injuries to his back, left arm and nose, was rushed to General Hospital in Nashville. It took him almost four months to recover and resume touring.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> In the meantime [[Charlie Cline]] and [[Jimmy Martin]] kept the band together.<ref name=\"Rosenberg\"/>{{Page needed|date=May 2024}}\n\nBy the late 1950s, however, Monroe's commercial fortunes had begun to slip.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> The rise of rock-and-roll and the development of the \"[[Nashville sound]]\" in mainstream [[country music]] both represented threats to the viability of bluegrass. While still a mainstay on the Grand Ole Opry, Monroe found diminishing success on the singles charts, and struggled to keep his band together in the face of declining demand for live performances.\n\n==Folk revival==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}\nMonroe's fortunes began to improve during the [[American folk music revival]] of the early 1960s. Many college students and other young people were beginning to discover Monroe, associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the country-and-western genre with which it had previously been identified.\n\nThe word \"bluegrass\" first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers, [[Reno and Smiley]], [[Jim & Jesse|Jim and Jesse]], and the [[Osborne Brothers]]. While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North, Monroe was slower to respond. Under the influence of [[Ralph Rinzler]], a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroe's manager in 1963, Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuit.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine ''[[Sing Out!]]'' that first publicly referred to Monroe as the \"father\" of bluegrass. Accordingly, at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at [[Roanoke, Virginia]] in 1965, Bill Monroe was the central figure.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nIn 1964, before the [[Grateful Dead]] got together, [[Jerry Garcia]] caravanned across the country from California to tag along with Monroe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gardenandgun.com/articles/jerry-garcias-bluegrass-roots/|title=Jerry Garcia's Bluegrass Roots|date=May 3, 2018|website=Gardenandgun.com|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe growing national popularity of Monroe's music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly diverse background of musicians recruited into his band. Non-southerners who served as Blue Grass Boys during this period included banjo player [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] and singer/guitarist [[Peter Rowan]] from Massachusetts,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> fiddler Gene Lowinger from New Jersey, banjo player Lamar Grier from Maryland, banjo player Steve Arkin from New York, and singer/guitarist [[Roland White]] and fiddler [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]] from California.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Hall of Fame Museum - June 2022 - Sarah Stierch.jpg|thumb|Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Hall of Fame Museum in [[Morgantown, Indiana]]. He founded the Hall in 1984.]]\nEven after the folk revival faded in the mid-1960s, it left a loyal audience for bluegrass music. Bluegrass festivals became common, with fans often traveling long distances to see a number of different acts over several days of performances.\n\nIn 1967, Monroe himself founded an annual bluegrass festival at [[Beanblossom, Indiana|Bean Blossom]] in southern Indiana, a park he had purchased in 1951,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> which routinely attracted a crowd of thousands; a double LP from the festival featuring Monroe, Jimmy Martin, Lester Flatt, and Jim and Jesse was released in 1973. The annual ''Bill Monroe Bean Blossom Bluegrass Festival'' is now the world's oldest continuously running annual bluegrass festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/loc.afc.afc-legacies.200002995/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905004417/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/IN/200002995.html|url-status=dead|title=Bill Monroe Bluegrass Festival in Brown County|first=Representative (9th District) Baron P.

Monroe recorded two albums of duets in the 1980s; the first featured collaborations with country stars such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], while the second paired him with other prominent bluegrass musicians.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> A 1989 live album celebrated his 50th year on the Grand Ole Opry.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Monroe also kept a hectic touring schedule.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> On April 7, 1990, Monroe performed for [[Farm Aid|Farm Aid IV]] in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana along with [[Willie Nelson]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Neil Young]] and with many other artists.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mitchell |first=Dawn |date=18 June 2007 |title=RetroIndy: Farm Aid IV raised a bumper crop of cash |url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2017/06/18/farm-aid-iv-raised-bumper-crop-cash/395865001/ |access-date=2024-05-08 |website=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\nMonroe's last performance occurred on March 15, 1996.

In 2003, [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] had Bill Monroe ranked No.&nbsp;16 on ''CMT 40 Greatest Men of Country Music''.\n\nArtists that claimed to be influenced by or to be playing the bluegrass genre were often bullied by Bill Monroe. He always considered himself the father and caretaker of bluegrass. He would often say of new bands that did not perform to his standards, \"That ain't no part of nothin'.\" Even those who question the scope of bluegrass refer to Monroe as a \"musical giant\" and recognize that \"there would be no bluegrass without Bill Monroe.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Teachout, Terry|title=Kentucky Troubadour: A biography of Bill Monroe and the bluegrass music he invented.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2001|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/09/17/reviews/000917.17teachot.html|access-date=January 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMore than 150 musicians played in the Blue Grass Boys over the nearly 60 years of Monroe's performing career. Monroe tended to recruit promising young musicians who served an apprenticeship with him before becoming accomplished artists in their own right. Some of Monroe's band members who went on to greater prominence include singer/guitarists [[Clyde Moody]], [[Lester Flatt]], Jack Cook, [[Mac Wiseman]], [[Jimmy Martin]], [[Carter Stanley]], [[Del McCoury]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Roland White]], Roland Dunn and [[Riders in the Sky (band)|Doug Green]]; banjo players [[Earl Scruggs]], Bob Black, [[Butch Robins]], [[Buck Trent]], [[Don Reno]], [[David \"Stringbean\" Akeman|Stringbean]], [[Osborne Brothers|Sonny Osborne]], and [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]]; and fiddlers Tommy Magness, [[Chubby Wise]], [[Vassar Clements]], [[Byron Berline]], [[Kenny Baker (fiddler)|Kenny Baker]], [[Bobby Hicks]], [[Gordon Terry]], [[Randall Franks]] and Glen Duncan. Monroe also regularly performed with flat-picking guitar virtuoso [[Doc Watson]].\n\nModern bluegrass singer and mandolin player [[Ricky Skaggs]] was influenced by Monroe. Skaggs was only six years old, in 1960, when he first got to perform on stage with Monroe and his band at the high school in Martha, Kentucky. He stated, \"I think Bill Monroe's importance to American music is as important as someone like Robert Johnson was to blues, or Louis Armstrong.

He began playing music in 1946, originally with his older brother [[Carter Stanley]] as part of [[The Stanley Brothers]], and most often as the leader of his band, '''The Clinch Mountain Boys'''. Ralph was also known as '''Dr. Ralph Stanley'''.\n\nHe was part of the first generation of [[bluegrass music]]ians and was inducted into both the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Honor]] and the [[Grand Ole Opry]].\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Ralph Stanley - Ralph Stanley II - Ron Baker 2008.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Stanley and son Ralph II in 2008]]\nStanley was born, grew up, and lived in rural [[Southwest Virginia]]\u2014\"in a little town called [[McClure, Virginia|McClure]] at a place called Big Spraddle Creek, just up the holler\" from where he moved in 1936. Before that he lived in another part of [[Dickenson County]].<ref name=\"virginia-living55\">\"Old-Time Man\" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 55.</ref> The son of Lee and Lucy Smith Stanley, Ralph did not grow up around a lot of music in his home.  As he said, his \"daddy didn't play an instrument, but sometimes he would sing church music... I'd hear him sing songs like '[[Man of Constant Sorrow]],' '[[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]]' and '[[Omie Wise]].'\"<ref name=\"virginia-living55\"/>\n\n{{blockquote|I got my first banjo when I was a teenager.  I guess I was 15, 16 years old.  My aunt had this old banjo, and Mother bought it for me ... paid $5 for it, which back then was probably like $5,000.  [My parents] had a little store, and I remember my aunt took it out in groceries.<ref name=\"virginia-living55\"/>}}\n\nHe learned to play the [[banjo]], [[clawhammer]] style, from his mother:\n\n{{blockquote|She had 11 brothers and sisters, and all of them could play the five-string banjo.  She played gatherings around the neighborhood, like bean stringin's. She tuned it up for me and played this tune, \"Shout Little Luly,\" and I tried to play it like she did.  But I think I developed my own style of the banjo.<ref name=\"virginia-living55\"/>}}\n\nHe graduated from high school on May 2, 1945, and was inducted into the [[United States Army|Army]] on May 16, serving for \"little more than a year.\" When he got home he immediately began performing:\n\n{{blockquote|... my daddy and Carter picked me up from the (station), and Carter was playing with another group, Roy Sykes and the Blue Ridge Mountain Boys, and they had a personal appearance that night.  So I sung a song with Carter on the radio before I even got home.<ref name=\"virginia-living56\">\"Old-Time Man\" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 56.</ref>}}\n\n===Clinch Mountain Boys===\n[[File:Dr. Ralph Stanley Grass Valley CA February 2006.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stanley in 2006]]\nAfter considering a course in \"veterinary\", he decided instead to join his older guitar-playing brother [[Carter Stanley]] (1925\u20131966) to form the Clinch Mountain Boys in 1946. Drawing heavily on the musical traditions of the area, which included the unique singing style of the [[Primitive Baptist Universalist]] church and the sweet down-home family harmonies of the [[Carter Family]], the two Stanley brothers began playing on local radio stations. They first performed at [[Norton, Virginia]]'s WNVA, but did not stay long there, moving on instead to [[Bristol, Virginia]], and [[WZAP|WCYB]] to start the show ''Farm and Fun Time'', where they stayed \"off and on for 12 years\".<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>\n\nAt first they covered \"a lot of [[Bill Monroe]] music\" (one of the first groups to pick up the new \"bluegrass\" format).<ref name=trischka>Trischka, Tony, \"Ralph Stanley\", ''Banjo Song Book'', Oak Publications, 1977</ref> They soon \"found out that didn't pay off\u2014we needed something of our own. So we started writing songs in 1947, 1948. I guess I wrote 20 or so banjo tunes, but Carter was a better writer than me.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/> When [[Columbia Records]] signed them as The Stanley Brothers, Monroe left in protest joining [[Decca Records]]. Later, Carter went back to sing for the \"Father of Bluegrass\", Monroe.\n\nRalph Stanley gave his opinion on Bill Monroe's apparent change of heart: \"He [Monroe] knew Carter would make him a good singer... Bill Monroe loved our music and loved our singing.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>\n\nThe Stanley Brothers joined [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] in the late '50s, a record company which was so eclectic that it included [[James Brown]] at the time. In fact, James Brown and his band were in the studio when the Stanley Brothers recorded \"[[Finger Poppin' Time]]\". \"James and his band were poppin' their fingers on that\" according to Ralph.<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>  At King Records, they \"went to a more 'Stanley style', the sound that people most know today.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>\n\nRalph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo act after Carter's death, from 1967 until his death in 2016.\n\n===Solo===\nAfter Carter died of complications of cirrhosis in 1966, after ailing for \"a year or so\",<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/> Ralph Stanley faced a hard decision on whether to continue performing on his own. \"I was worried, I didn't know if I could do it by myself. But boy, I got letters, 3,000 of 'em, and phone calls... I went to Syd Nathan at King and asked him if he wanted me to go on, and he said, 'Hell yes! You might be better than both of them.'\"<ref name=\"virginia-living567\">\"Old-Time Man\" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 56-7.</ref>\n\nHe decided to go it alone, eventually reviving The Clinch Mountain Boys. [[Larry Sparks]], Roy Lee Centers, and Charlie Sizemore were among those with whom he played in the revived band. He encountered [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[Keith Whitley]] arriving late to his own show, \"They were about 16 or 17, and they were holding the crowd 'til we got there... They sounded just exactly like (the Stanley Brothers).\"<ref name=\"virginia-living57\">\"Old-Time Man\" interview by Don Harrison June 2008 ''[[Virginia Living]]'', p. 57.</ref> Seeing their potential, he hired them \"to give 'em a chance\", though that meant a seven-member band.<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/> Eventually, his son, Ralph Stanley II, took over as lead singer and rhythm guitarist for The Clinch Mountain Boys.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ralphstanleyii.com/history.html |title=Ralph Stanley II.|website=Ralphstanleyii.com |access-date=September 17, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302005927/http://www.ralphstanleyii.com/history.html |archive-date=March 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His grandson Nathan Stanley became the last lead singer and band leader for The Clinch Mountain Boys.{{Citation needed|date=April 2021}}\n\n===Clinch Mountain Boys members===\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}\n\n====1967 to 2016====\n{{div col|colwidth=24em}}\n*Ralph Stanley ([[Lead vocalist]], [[banjo]])\n*Jack Cooke ([[upright bass|bass]])\n*[[Curly Ray Cline]] ([[fiddle]])\n*[[George Shuffler]] ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]], [[upright bass|bass]])\n*[[Lonesome Pine Fiddlers|Melvin Goins]] ([[upright bass|bass]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*[[Larry Sparks]] ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Roy Lee Centers ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*[[Ricky Skaggs]] ([[mandolin]], [[fiddle]])\n*[[Keith Whitley]] ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Charlie Sizemore ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Hook n Beans (Buddy Moore) lead singer- guitar\n*Ricky Lee ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Junior Blankenship ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Kenneth Davis ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Renfro Proffit ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*[[Dry Branch Fire Squad|Ron Thomason]] ([[mandolin]])\n*Steve Sparkman ([[banjo]])\n*[[James Alan Shelton]] ([[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Sammy Adkins ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Todd Meade ([[fiddle]])\n*Ralph 'Hank' Smith ([[Steel-string guitar|Lead guitar]])\n*Ernie Thacker ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]], [[mandolin]])\n*John Rigsby ([[mandolin]])\n*Dewey Brown ([[fiddle]]),([[Vocals]])\n*Jimmy Cameron ([[Bass guitar|Bass]]), ([[Vocals]])\n*Audey Ratliff ([[upright bass|bass]])\n*Ralph Stanley II ([[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*Nathan Stanley ([[mandolin]], [[Lead vocalist]], [[Steel-string guitar|guitar]])\n*James Price ([[fiddle]])\n*Randall Hibbitts ([[upright bass|bass]])\n*Mitchell Van Dyke ([[banjo]])\n*Jarrod Church ([[banjo]])\n*Alex Hibbitts ([[Mandolin]])\n*Jimmie Vaughan  ([[Rhythm Guitar]], [[Vocals]])\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Political career===\nAbout 1970, Ralph Stanley ran for Clerk of Court and Commissioner of Revenue in [[Dickenson County, Virginia|Dickenson County]] and said:\n\n{{blockquote|What happened is, somebody traded me off\u2014[[dummy candidate|they used my popularity and money to elect somebody else]].

He wanted it in the [[Dock Boggs]] style.  So I got my banjo and learned it the way he did it.  You see, I had recorded \"O Death\" three times, done it with Carter.

Bluegrass legend Bill Monroe thought that Rowan sounded like himself. \u201cWhen the two harmonized together, they were said to reach \u2018heavenly heights.\u2019\"<ref name=\"Peter Rowan Discography\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.peter-rowan.com/biography.html|title=Peter Rowan Discography|website=www.peter-rowan.com|access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref> Rowan co-wrote \u2018Walls Of Time\u2019 with Monroe, which has since become a bluegrass standard. Peter Rowan's Bluegrass Band consists of Blaine Sprouse on fiddle, Christopher Henry on mandolin, Paul Knight on bass, Patrick Sauber on banjo, Jamie Oldaker on drums. The band plays Rowan's original tunes along with Bill Monroe and Carter Family classics. \n\n'''Peter Rowan's Big Twang Theory'''\n\nRowan leads Big Twang Theory with musicians Mike Witcher on dobro, Paul Knight on bass, [[Nina Gerber]] on electric guitar, and Rowan's son Michael Carter Rowan on guitar and vocals. Drummers Larry Attamanuik and Ken Owen and banjo player Jeff Mosier also appear with Rowan's Big Twang Theory when their schedules permit. \"I have always wanted a band that was rooted in bluegrass, but could add the twang of Hank Williams, Carl Perkins and Buddy Holly. They all absorbed Bill Monroe's bluegrass into honky-tonk and rockabilly. I grew up dancing to that music.\u201d<ref name=\"Peter Rowan Discography\"/> \u2013 Peter Rowan.\n\n'''Peter Rowan's Twang an' Groove'''\n\nTwang an\u2019 Groove is a blend of rhythm and blues, reggae, and bluegrass music. The band features Rowan on electric guitar and vocals, Blaine Sprouse on fiddle, Mike Morgan on bass, and virtuoso drummer, Jamie Oldaker.\n<ref name=\"Peter Rowan Discography\"/>\n\n'''Peter Rowan & Crucial Reggae'''\n\nThis outfit is Rowan's nod to reggae music. Rowan's diversity in musical ability ventures beyond his bluegrass roots with Crucial Reggae to bring some of Rowan's most soulful original music to light. He is accompanied by reggae greats Tony Chin and Fully Fullwood, on guitar and bass respectively. Crucial Reggae is sometimes accompanied by other musicians to form an either five or six-piece band. They become a nine-piece band when they are joined by the Burning Spear horn section.\n\n'''The Free Mexican Airforce'''\n\nThe Free Mexican Airforce features Rowan and some of his most beloved songs: \"Come Back to Old Santa Fe\", \"Ride the Wild Mustang\", \"Midnight Moonlight\", and \"Free Mexican Airforce\". This four-piece often features Cindy Cashdollar on pedal steel guitar along with players on bass and drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peter-rowan.com/biography.html|title=Peter Rowan Discography|website=www.peter-rowan.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n{{Further|Peter Rowan discography}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Fiorito, Mike (2023), ''Mescalito Riding His White Horse, Inspired by the Musical Adventures of Peter Rowan'' (O-Books)\n* Goldsmith, Thomas (2004), ''The Bluegrass Reader'', University of Illinois Press\n* Jackson, Blair (), ''Garcia: An American Life'', Penguin\n* Rosenberg, Neil V. \u2013 Wolfe, Charles (1991), Booklet: ''Bill Monroe, Bluegrass 1959\u20131969'', Bear Family BCD 15529\n* Von Schmidt, Eric \u2013 Rooney, Jim (1994), ''Baby, Let Me Follow You Down'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]]\n\n==External links==\n{{cc}}\n* [http://www.peter-rowan.com Official website]\n*{{allmusic}}\n\n{{Old & In the Way}}\n{{New Riders of the Purple Sage}}\n{{International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rowan, Peter}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American Buddhists]]\n[[Category:American folk guitarists]]\n[[Category:American folk singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Boston]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:Old & In the Way members]]\n[[Category:Earth Opera members]]\n[[Category:Muleskinner (band) members]]\n[[Category:Seatrain (band) members]]\n[[Category:Blue Grass Boys members]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

Around the same time, the group switched record labels from [[Rebel Records]] to [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]]. In 1986, Rosenthal and Gray left the band, and were replaced by [[Lou Reid]] and [[T.

Reid left the band in 1992, and Starling briefly returned to the group, performing on their 1994 album ''[[Like We Used to Be]]''. Starling was replaced by [[Moondi Klein]] as the band's lead singer.\n\nDuring 1995 and 1996, Klein, Coleman, and Auldridge, left the Seldom Scene to form a new band called [[Chesapeake (band)|Chesapeake]]. Duffey and Eldridge recruited guitarist Fred Travers, bassist Ronnie Simpkins, and guitarist and singer [[Dudley Connell]] into the Seldom Scene, and together released the album ''[[Dream Scene]]'' in 1996.

Starling and Rosenthal shared their lead vocals on the group's sixth studio album, ''[[Baptizing (album)|Baptizing]]'' (recorded in 1978). Around the same time, the group switched record labels from [[Rebel Records|Rebel]] to [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill]].

His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the traditional way the five-string banjo had previously been played. This new style of playing became popular and elevated the banjo from its previous role as a background rhythm instrument to featured solo status. He popularized the instrument across several genres of music.\n\nScruggs' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in [[Bill Monroe]]'s band, the Blue Grass Boys. \"Bluegrass\" eventually became the name for an entire genre of country music. Despite considerable success with Monroe, performing on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and recording classic hits such as \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\", Scruggs resigned from the group in 1948 because of their exhausting touring schedule. Fellow band member [[Lester Flatt]] resigned as well, and he and Scruggs later paired up in the duo [[Flatt and Scruggs]]. Scruggs' banjo instrumental \"[[Foggy Mountain Breakdown]]\" was recorded in December 1949 and released in March 1950. The song became an enduring hit. The song experienced a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. The song won two [[Grammy Award]]s and, in 2005, was selected for the Library of Congress' [[National Recording Registry]] of works of unusual merit.\n\nFlatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit \"[[The Ballad of Jed Clampett]]\", the theme music for the television sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''\u2014the first Scruggs recording to reach number one on the [[Billboard charts]]. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 [[Single (music)|singles]]. The duo broke up in 1969, chiefly because, while Scruggs wanted to switch styles to fit a more modern sound, Flatt was a traditionalist who opposed the change and believed doing so would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists. Although each of them formed a new band to match their visions, neither of them ever regained the success they had achieved as a team.\n \nScruggs received four Grammy awards, a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and a [[List of recipients of the National Medal of Arts|National Medal of Arts]]. He became a member of the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]] and was given a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 1985, Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and named, as a duo, number 24 on [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]]'s \"40 Greatest Men of Country Music\". Scruggs was awarded a [[National Heritage Fellowship]] by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the highest honor in the [[Folk music|folk]] and traditional arts in the United States.

Endless and unfulfilling clerical jobs along [[Music Row]] motivated this triple-threat singer, writer, and multi-instrumentalist to start her own [[record label]], Addiebelle Music.<ref name=\"adrienneyoung.com\"/> She also formed the short-lived band Liters of Pop with [[Eric McConnell]].\n\nShe learned to play clawhammer-style banjo from Ketch Secor of [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], and set about amassing a catalog of [[old-time music|old-time]] tunes.  As she says:\n\n{{blockquote|I got really into [[traditional music]] when I was longing to connect with my family again, and that led to trying to build up a repertoire that my grandfather was familiar with, the classic [[old-time music|old-time]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tunes.<ref>[http://www.courant.com/ \"Adrienne Young's Activism Keeps Her In Tune\"] by Eric R. Danton, Courant Rock Critic, August 17, 2007 [[Hartford Courant]].</ref>}}\n\nYoung began gaining attention with her 2003 win in the Chris Austin songwriting contest at [[MerleFest]] for \"Sadie's Song\".  Co-written with [[Mark D. Sanders]], the song is a re-telling of the murderous bluegrass standard \"[[Little Sadie]]\" told from the victim's point of view.\n\n== Recordings ==\n\"[[Little Sadie]]\" featured prominently on her first [[CD]], ''[[Plow to the End of the Row]]'', produced with another [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-based musician, [[Will Kimbrough]], and released on her own [[AddieBelle]] [[record label]].  (The label takes its name from a nickname Young was given while working as a tour guide at Nashville's [[Belle Meade Mansion]].)  The [[CD]], which includes a packet of wildflower seeds along with artwork based on the ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'', was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Album Package.\n\nAn early version of ''Plow to the End of the Row'', released in 2003, has become a sought-after collectible.  That version included several tracks with Young backed by [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] and was a top pick for 2003 Debut Artist by the Freeform American Roots DJ Chart.  The nationally-released version, featuring different sequencing, new tracks, and re-recorded versions of several songs, was released on April 13, 2004, one day before an interview with Young aired on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''.  The [[Americana Music Association]] included Young and her band in their nominees for Emerging Artist of the Year, and the ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' named \"Home Remedy\" as Best Country Single of the year.  The CD went on to place at or near the top of numerous \"best of\" lists for the year and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Young \"the [[Americana (music)|Americana]] music find of the year.\"\n\n[[Image:Adrienne Young Andy Thacker Little Sadie Little Grill Collective Harrisonburg VA June 2008.jpg|left|thumb|250px|With Andy Thacker of Little Sadie<br>[[Little Grill Collective]], June 27, 2008.]]\nYoung and her band Little Sadie (at the time, Tyler Grant on guitar, Clayton Campbell on fiddle and mandolin, Amanda Kowalski on bass, and Steven Sandifer on percussion) toured extensively across the U.S. and in England.  The members of the band left to pursue other projects prior to the recording of Young's second CD, ''[[The Art of Virtue]]''.\n\nThat disc, released on June 28, 2005, took its theme from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Benjamin Franklin#Thirteen Virtues|Thirteen Virtues]]''.  A copy of Franklin's pamphlet is included with the CD.  Will Kimbrough co-produced the CD and co-wrote several tracks.  Alongside original songs and traditional tunes, the disc featured a cover of the [[Grateful Dead]] song \"Brokedown Palace\".  Young's AddieBelle label struck a distribution deal with [[Ryko Records]] which insured that her music got placed in more record stores.  She also continued to receive support from [[public radio]] and was invited to appear on ''[[World Cafe (radio program)|World Cafe]]'', ''[[Mountain Stage]]'', and ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]''.  With a new incarnation of Little Sadie (fiddler and banjoist Eric Merrill, guitarist Hans Holzen, bassist Kyle Kegerreis, and percussionist Eric Platz), Young toured even more extensively in 2005.\n\n''The Art of Virtue'' placed third in [[Amazon.com]]'s list of the best folk recordings of the year.  Young was invited to sing in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] on January 17, 2006, as part of Benjamin Franklin's 300th birthday celebration.\n\nIn May 2006, Young took her band to [[Levon Helm]]'s studio in [[Woodstock, New York]] to record tracks for a third album, titled ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]],'' which was released May 22, 2007.\n\n== Social and environmental action ==\nYoung's second CD, ''[[The Art of Virtue]]'' released in 2005, took its theme from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''Thirteen Virtues'' and included copy of Franklin's pamphlet inside.  The title track addressed issues that Young found herself pondering after the 2004 re-election of [[George W. Bush]], specifically how the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had leveraged the theme of [[morality]] as a [[Political campaign|campaign]] tool.  As she said at the time:\n\n{{blockquote|There seems to be a growing passion, collectively and individually, to understand the foundation of our American culture and how we've turned from that. Personally, it steered me back toward a time when our country was rooted in agrarian ideals and words were powerful enough to begin a new world.  Ben Franklin had such a practical approach toward nurturing virtue, the first point being nobody's perfect.}}\n\nSince 2004 Young has been a spokeswoman for the [[FoodRoutes Network]], which aims to aid organizations in rebuilding local, community-based food systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://girlcooksworld.com/|title=Girl Cooks World - Global Cuisine, Cooking Tips, Must-haves & Ideas|website=Girlcooksworld.com|access-date=20 April 2023}}</ref>  Young used the release of the [[CD]] ''[[The Art of Virtue]]'' to call attention to her involvement with the FoodRoutes Network, a non-profit organization that promotes [[sustainable agriculture]] and connects consumers with local farmers who are willing to sell direct.  ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]]'' furthers her involvement in this movement with lyrics and songs directly addressing the issue.\n\n<blockquote>This wasn't the first time she mixed her farm action fever with artistic output: ''Plow to the End of the Row'', her 2004 debut CD, came with a packet of seeds enclosed (and was nominated for the packaging design Grammy).</blockquote>\n\nYoung advocates locally-grown and [[sustainable agriculture]]. A portion of each record sold of ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]]'' goes to the Save A Seed fund, which she created with nonprofit organizations the [[FoodRoutes Network]] and the [[American Community Gardening Association]]. The money will provide non-genetically modified seeds to community gardens across North America.\n\nYoung has toured with help from the organization Buy Fresh Buy Local and each of the 49 FoodRoutes chapters. Along with her performances, each tour stop offered [[sustainable living]] workshops with local sponsors in each community. \"Preserving cultural genetics and agricultural heritage is the key to true security and self-reliance\", she says.\n\nYoung says her music has influenced her activism because she feels at peace in nature and wants to communicate those feelings through her music.\n\nAs of 2010, Adrienne Young has hosted and organized the Backyard Revolution, a group of people sharing and demonstrating unique skills of the past and present to help educate people in self sustainability.  The Backyard Revolution was present at Floyd Fest 9 (2010) and the Heritage Harvest Festival at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. Demonstrations included: Backyard dairy cow (cow included), hide tanning and bow drill fire-making, home fermentation, historic log cabin construction, arrow fletching, soap making, primitive cooking, edible and medicinal wild plants, and more. See www.backyardrevolution.com for more information.\n\n== Sound and style ==\nHer music, created with various incarnations of her band Little Sadie, blends elements of [[bluegrass music|Bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[old-time music]], and [[American folk music]] with a pop sensibility.\n\n{{blockquote|Young's bluegrass chops come through clearly and there's more than enough high-spirited music to get you up and dancing or clapping along, and more than enough substance to keep you reflecting on the lyrics long after the music's done, too.<ref>[http://www.dirtylinen.com review of ''Room to Grow''] August/September 2007 [[Dirty Linen (magazine)|Dirty Linen]].</ref>|review of \"Room to Grow\"|''[[Dirty Linen (magazine)|Dirty Linen]]''}}\n\n<blockquote>. . tightly crafted songs that, like the feel of her home and the flow of her conversation, infuse her love for American tradition with high contemporary energy.

Sons Eddie and Roy Carter stepped in to sing tenor and bass, respectively, which began the tradition of Carter siblings, children, and eventually grandchildren joining the Gang.\n\nBy the mid-1970s, the group was still touring part-time but felt a lack of support from the label they had recorded for during the previous three decades.  Columbia had stopped servicing their songs to radio; thus, airplay had become non-existent. The decision was eventually made to move on from Columbia in the interest of rebuilding the group to a position akin to what it had enjoyed in years past. To that end, in 1979 they began recording for Copperfield Records and remained with that label for several years. <ref>Bob Terrell ''The Chuck Wagon Gang: A Legend Lives On'' 1990</ref>\n\n==1980s to Present Day==\nAfter its relationship with Copperfield Records ended, the Chuck Wagon Gang began recording for Associated Artists.  It was during this era that the group took advantage of its renewed popularity and, in keeping with the gospel sounds of the time, added a piano player to the lineup for live concerts.  Fans responded positively to this sound, eventually culminating in the Gang receiving the \"Best Gospel Group in Country Music\" award at the Music City News Awards in 1988. <ref>Bob Terrell ''The Chuck Wagon Gang: A Legend Lives On'' 1990</ref>\n\nRoy approached Anna's granddaughter Shaye in 1993, asking her to assume the responsibility of singing soprano upon the retirement of member Debbie Trusty.  Shaye accepted Roy's offer and sang soprano with the Gang until the retirement of alto singer Ruth Ellen Carter Yates a few years later, when she moved to her current position of alto singer.   Roy subsequently retired, bringing about a new era for the Gang in which none of Dad Carter's children were members.  As the 21st century dawned, the Gang sought to return to its origins, paring its sound back to the beautiful simplicity of four-part harmony accompanied by a single guitar.  Once again, fans responded positively.  As of 2024, the Gang records for Crossroads Label Group.

He also holds several credits as a session fiddler and mandolinist.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early influences===\nWhen Haynie was nine, he began taking fiddle lessons from his grandmother's cousin, a man named Ted Locke.  He studied the fiddle, for two years, after which he took up the mandolin. He became exceedingly good at both, and within two years he joined a bluegrass band named the Bluegrass Parlor Band. While he was traveling, he got a chance to meet [[Chubby Wise]], a self-styled \"original\" [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]], on many occasions. These opportunities enriched his sense of music, and were a great inspiration to him in his younger years.  Another major influence on Haynie's music was that of Kenny Baker, whose fiddle albums were some of his favorites. Those familiar with Baker's fiddle style might recognize similarities in Haynie's sound.\n\nIn 1990, at age 16, attending the [[Florida]] fiddling championships, and competing, Haynie won first place in the contemporary division for the second time, playing Wild Fiddler's Rag and [[Les Patineurs (waltz)|Skater's Waltz]].<ref>{{cite news |first = Jeff |last = Klinkenberg |title = FIT AS A FIDDLE Series: DATELINE FLORIDA |work = St. Petersburg Times |date = 1990-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1996 Haynie lost two [[violins]] and a [[Violin bow|bow]], when a lightning-induced fire burnt [[Tim Austin (musician)|Tim Austin]]'s [[Doobie Shea Records|Doobie Shea Studios]] to the ground.<ref>{{cite news |first = Mark |last = Morrison |title = Bluegrass Studio up in Flames |work = Roanoke Times & World News |date = 1996-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Madelyn |author-link=Madelyn Rosenberg |date=1997-07-30 |title=A Year After a Fire at the Doobie Shea Studios, Tim Austin has the Music Miked and Tapes Humming the Bands Play On... |work=Roanoke Times & World News}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Haynie won the fiddle category at the 39th Annual [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards.<ref>{{cite news |title = Off-Camera Awards Winners Announced for the 39th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards Live Awards Telecast to Be Broadcast From Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas Wednesday, May 26th at 8:00 PM ET/PT on CBS Television Network |publisher = PR Newswire (U.S.) |date = 2004-05-06}}</ref>\n\nHaynie has been seen appearing in informal music performances under other musicians' headlines, and earned a living as a [[session musician]].\n\n==Discography==\n*''Doin' My Time'' (Sugar Hill, 1997)\n*''A Man Must Carry On'' (Sugar Hill, 2000)\n*''The Bluegrass Fiddle Album'' (Sugar Hill, 2003)\n\n==Awards==\n*[[International Bluegrass Music Association]] Instrumental Album of the Year - 2003 for ''The Bluegrass Fiddle Album'' IBMA Awards - Past Recipients <ref name=\"IBMA Awards - Past Recipients\">[http://www.ibma.org/ibma.awards/recipients/index.asp IBMA Awards - Past Recipients] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223141121/http://www.ibma.org/ibma.awards/recipients/index.asp |date=2009-02-23 }}</ref>\n*[[Academy of Country Music]] Award for fiddle - 2004\n*[[International Bluegrass Music Association]] Recorded Event of the Year - 1996 for ''Bluegrass '95'' (Scott Vestal, Aubrey Haynie, [[Adam Steffey]], Wayne Benson, Barry Bales & Clay Jones) <ref name=\"IBMA Awards - Past Recipients\" />\n*[[International Bluegrass Music Association]] Gospel Recorded Performance of the Year - 1998 - for ''Stanley Gospel Tradition: Songs About Our Savior'' (Tim Austin, Barry Bales, Ronnie Bowman, Aubrey Haynie, James King, Dwight McCall, Dale Perry, Don Rigsby, [[James Alan Shelton]], Junior Sisk, Charlie Sizemore, Craig Smith, Scottie Sparks, Adam Steffey, Ernie Thacker, Dan Tyminski) <ref name=\"IBMA Awards - Past Recipients\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haynie, Aubrey}}\n[[Category:1974 births]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass fiddlers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American session musicians]]\n[[Category:American country fiddlers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Tampa, Florida]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass mandolinists]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Florida]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Florida]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

Both artists stated that both artists can \"be replaced\" by other musicians.<ref>{{cite web|title=Telegraaf.nl 'Ilse gat over The Common Linnets'|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/tv/prive/overig/22677689/___Ilse_gaat_over_The_Common_Linnets___.html|publisher=telegraaf.nl|access-date=28 May 2014}}</ref> Since May 2014 the band consists of Ilse DeLange, JB Meijers, Jake Etheridge and Matthew Crosby (also the writers of the hit song \"Calm After The Storm\").\n\nIlse DeLange was born on 13 May 1977 in [[Almelo]], [[Netherlands]].

Waylon wrote an article on his official Facebook website that \"both members did not foresee the success of the band\" and that he is currently occupied with his album that is going to be released in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Telegraaf.nl 'Waylon is gevonden'|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/filmenuitgaan/muziek/22677591/__Waylon_is_gevonden___.html|publisher=telegraaf.nl|access-date=28 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Facebook: Waylon Music|url=https://www.facebook.com/waylonmusic|publisher=facebook|access-date=28 May 2014}}</ref>\n\nJB Meijers was born on 10 June 1972 in [[Delft]], [[Netherlands]].

Soon, he joined with two first cousins, Red and Gerald, to form a local string band. In his early teens Clements met [[Bill Monroe]] and the [[Blue Grass Boys]] when they came to Florida to visit Clements' stepfather, a friend of fiddler [[Chubby Wise]]. Clements was impressed with his playing.\n\nIn late 1949, Wise left Monroe's group, and the 21 year-old Clements traveled by bus to ask for an audition. When told he would have to return the next day, Clements was crestfallen, lacking the money for either a hotel room or return bus trip. Monroe gave him some money to a night's lodging, and the next day Clements auditioned and was hired. He remained with Monroe for seven years, recording with the band in 1950 and 1951.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nBetween 1957 and 1962, he was a member of the [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band [[Jim and Jesse]] & the Virginia Boys.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>  He also gained recognition joining with the popular bluegrass duo of [[Flatt and Scruggs]] on the popular theme to the hit television sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''. [[Earl Scruggs]]' path-breaking banjo style had premiered with Bill Monroe in the late 1940s, and thereafter gained widespread renown with [[Lester Flatt]] and the Foggy Mountain Boys.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, however, his struggles with alcohol left him making his living in [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar trades]], being employed briefly at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida as a plumber, in a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[paper mill]], and as switchman for [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]].  He even sold insurance and once operated a convenience store while owning a [[potato chip]] [[franchising|franchise]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Sobering up, he returned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1967, where he became a much sought-after studio musician.\n\nAfter a brief touring stint with [[Faron Young]] he joined [[John Hartford]]'s Dobrolic Plectral Society in 1971,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> when he met guitarist [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]] and [[Dobro]] player [[Tut Taylor]], and recorded ''[[Aereo-Plain]]'', a widely acclaimed \"newgrass\" album that helped broaden the bluegrass market and sound. After less than a year he joined up with Earl Scruggs.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nHis 1972 work with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] on their album ''[[Will the Circle be Unbroken (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Will the Circle be Unbroken]]'' earned even wider acclaim, and he later worked on the [[Grateful Dead]]'s ''[[Wake of the Flood]]'' and [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s ''[[A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Within the next two years, Clements would cut his first solo album.\n\nIn 1973, he joined and toured with the bluegrass supergroup [[Old & In the Way]] with [[Jerry Garcia]],<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> [[David Grisman]], [[Peter Rowan]], and [[John Kahn]]; their self-titled live album ''[[Old & In the Way (album)|Old & In the Way]]'' was released in 1975.\n[[File:Vassar Clements, Seattle, 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Clements in 1974]]\nIn 1974 he lent his talents to ''[[Highway Call]]'', a solo album by former [[Allman Brothers Band]] guitarist [[Dickey Betts]].\nHe was considered by many to be an outstanding fiddle virtuoso and he described his talent saying, {{blockquote|It was God's gift, something born in me. I was too dumb to learn it any other way. I listened to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] some. I'd pick it up one note at a time. I was young, with plenty of time and I didn't give up. You'd come home from school, do your lessons and that's it. No other distractions. I don't read music. I play what I hear.}}\n\nIn his 50-year career he played with artists ranging from [[Woody Herman]] and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band to the Grateful Dead, [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Paul McCartney]], and earned at least five [[Grammy Award]] nominations and numerous professional accolades. He once recorded with the pop group [[the Monkees]] by happenstance, when he stayed behind after an earlier recording session. He also appeared in [[Robert Altman]]'s 1975 film ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]''<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and [[Alan Rudolph]]'s 1976 film, ''[[Welcome to L.A.]]''. He made a duet album with [[St\u00e9phane Grappelli]] ''Together at Last'' in 1987.\n\nIn 2004, he performed in concert with jazz quartet Third Stream \u2013 in which a video documentary of the concert was done with Jim Easton (guitar), Tom Strohman (sax), Jim Miller (bass), and John Peifer (drums).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vassarclements.com/tourdates_2004.html|title=Vassar Clements - Tour Dates 2004|website=Vassarclements.com|access-date=August 5, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThough he played numerous instruments, Clements indicated that he chose the fiddle over guitar recalling that, \"I picked up a guitar and fiddle and tried them both out. The guitar was pretty easy, but I couldn't get nothing out of the fiddle. So every time I'd see those instruments sitting side by side, I'd grab that fiddle.\"\n\n[[Big band]] and [[swing music]] were considerable influences upon his style and musical development, and he said that, \"Bands like [[Glenn Miller]], [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Harry James]] and [[Artie Shaw]] were very popular when I was a kid. I always loved rhythm, so I guess in the back of my mind the swing and jazz subconsciously comes out when I play, because when I was learning I was always trying to emulate the big-band sounds I heard on my fiddle.\"\n\nVassar Clements played on over 200 albums, including nearly 40 on which he starred or was featured. His albums often featured newgrass style music and what Clements called \"Hillbilly Jazz\". His last album, ''Livin' With the Blues'', released in 2004, was his only blues recording; it featured guest appearances by [[Elvin Bishop]], [[Norton Buffalo]], [[Maria Muldaur]], and others.\n\nHis 2005 [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]] was for \"Earl's Breakdown,\" by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and featured Clements, Earl Scruggs, Randy Scruggs, and [[Jerry Douglas (musician)|Jerry Douglas]].\n\nClements, whose last performance was February 4, 2005 in [[Jamestown, New York|Jamestown]], [[New York (state)|New York]], died on August 16, 2005, aged 77, of lung cancer.<ref name=\"Billboard\">{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61748/bluegrass-great-vassar-clements-dies |title=Bluegrass Great Vassar Clements Dies |date=2005-08-17 |magazine=Billboard |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1507703/legendary-fiddler-vassar-clements-dead-at-age-77/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713205822/http://www.cmt.com/news/1507703/legendary-fiddler-vassar-clements-dead-at-age-77/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 13, 2019 |title=Legendary Fiddler Vassar Clements Dead at Age 77 |last=Gilbert |first=Calvin |date=2005-08-16 |website=CMT News |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/article.php/20050817130351719 |title=World Music Central - Legendary Fiddler Vassar Clements Dies at 77 |date=2005-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110110716/http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/article.php/20050817130351719 |archive-date=2005-11-10 |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n*''Southern Country Waltzes'' [[Rural Rhythm Records]] (1970)\n*''Vassar'' [[Mercury Records]] (1975)\n*''Superbow'' Mercury Records\n*''Crossing the Catskills'' (1973) Rounder Records\n*''[[Vassar Clements, John Hartford, Dave Holland]]'' (1988) [[Rounder Records]]\n*''Vassar Clements'' MCA Records\n*''The Bluegrass Session'' Flying Records\n*''Grass Routes'' Rounder Records\n*''Saturday Night Shuffle \u2013 A Celebration of Merle Travis'' Shanachie Records\n*''Hillbilly Jazz'' Flying Fish Records\n*''Hillbilly Jazz Rides Again'' (1986) Flying Fish Records   \n*''New Hillbilly Jazz'' Shikata Records\n*''Together at Last'' (Stephane Grappelli & Vassar Clements) Flying Fish Records\n*''Nashville Jam'' Flying Fish Records\n*''Westport Drive Mind'' Dust Records\n*''The Man, The Legend'' Vassillie Productions\n*''Country Classics'' Vassillie Productions\n*''Vassar Clements Reunion with Dixie Gentlemen'' Old Homestead\n*''Once in a While'' (Jam with Miles Davis' ex-band members) Flying Fish Records\n*''Live in Telluride'' (1979) Vassillie Productions\n*''Music City USA'' Vassillie Productions\n*''[[Old & In the Way (album)|Old & In the Way]]'' (1975) Rounder Records\n*''[[That High Lonesome Sound]]'' (1996) Acoustic Disc\n*''[[Breakdown (Old & In the Way album)|Breakdown]]'' (1997) Acoustic Disc\n*''[[Live at the Boarding House]]'' (2008) Acoustic Disc\n*''[[Live at the Boarding House: The Complete Shows]]'' (2013) Acoustic Disc\n*''[[The Bluegrass Sessions: Tales from the Acoustic Planet, Vol. 2]]'' (with [[B\u00e9la Fleck]]) (1999) Warner Bros.

(song)|Charlie and the MTA]]\" in 1963. Two years later, he joined the Down City Ramblers, where he remained through 1971. That year, he made his recording debut on ''15 Bluegrass Instrumentals'' with the band Country Cooking; at the same time, he was also a member of America's premier sports-rock band Country Granola.\n\nIn 1973, he began a three-year stint with Breakfast Special. Between 1974 and 1975, he recorded two solo albums, ''Bluegrass Light'' and ''Heartlands''. Ethnomusicologist Benjamin Krakauer devotes an article to the legacy of this group in the bluegrass community, described as of ''experimental bluegrass musicians from New York City'':<ref name=\"Krakauer\">{{cite journal |last1= Krakauer|first1=Benjamin |date= Summer 2018|title=Music Scene and Its Fringes: Experimental Bluegrass of 1970s New York City |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/americanmusic.36.2.0163 |journal=American Music  |volume= 36|issue=2 |pages=163-193 |doi= 10.5406/americanmusic.36.2.0163|access-date=February 19, 2024}}</ref> {{Blockquote|text=Breakfast Special's innovative music incorporates jazz, avant-garde, psychedelic, klezmer, and various non- Western musical elements into their irreverent and often absurdist performances}}.

Trischka toured with the show in 1978, the year he also played with the [[Monroe Doctrine]].\nIn 1978, Trischka toured Japan and recorded with [[Peter Rowan]] and [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]]. In the early 1980s, he began recording with his group Skyline, which released its first album in 1983. Later albums included ''Robot Plane Flies over Arkansas'' (solo, 1983), ''Stranded in the Moonlight'' (with Skyline, 1984) and ''Hill Country'' (solo, 1985). In 1984, he performed in his first feature film, ''[[Foxfire (1987 film)|Foxfire]]''. Three years later, he worked on the pre-recorded music for the off-Broadway production of ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' that featured Jessica Tandy and [[Morgan Freeman]]. Trischka produced the Belgian group Gold Rush's ''No More Angels'' in 1988. The following year, Skyline recorded its final album, ''Fire of Grace''. He also recorded the theme song for ''Books on the Air'', a popular [[National Public Radio]] show, and continued his affiliation with the network by appearing on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'', ''[[Mountain Stage]]'', ''From Our Front Porch'', and other radio shows. Trischka continued his recording career with 1993's ''World Turning'', 1995's ''Glory Shone Around: A Christmas Collection'' and 1999's ''Bend''. ''New Deal'' followed in 2003.\n\n''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'', featuring appearances by [[Steve Martin]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] and [[Tony Rice]], came out four years later. For this recording Trischka went back to bluegrass and reinvigorated the double banjo tradition. In October 2007, he was given an IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) award for Banjo Player of the Year 2007. ''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'' received IBMA awards for Recorded Event of the Year, Instrumental Album of the Year and a Grammy Nomination.\n\nHe has written over fifteen instructional books and a series of DVDs. In July 2009 he launched the groundbreaking ''Online Banjo School with Tony Trischka'', an interactive, online learning school that teaches students around the world how to play banjo with [[ArtistWorks]]. Trischka is closely associated with \"newgrass,\" which features several innovations to traditional bluegrass, including jazzy arrangements, non-traditional chordal structures, and frequent covers of non-bluegrass songs. Trischka is one of the major innovators of the \"chromatic\" banjo style, which features sinewy, snaky melodic runs not strictly played out of chord positions.\n\n2011 saw ''Give Me the Banjo'' aired on PBS stations nationwide with Trischka as the musical director and co-producer of the documentary. It was released on DVD. He produced [[Steve Martin]]'s Grammy-nominated ''Rare Bird Alert'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]]), which features performances by [[Paul McCartney]], the [[Dixie Chicks]] and the [[Steep Canyon Rangers]].\n\nIn December 2012, Trischka was awarded the United States Artists Friends Fellow in recognition of the excellence of his work.<ref>{{Cite web|title=United States Artists \u00bb Tony Trischka|url=https://www.unitedstatesartists.org/fellow/tony-trischka/|access-date=July 11, 2021|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader===\n* ''Bluegrass Light'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1974)\n* ''Heartlands'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1975)\n* ''Banjoland'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1977)\n* ''Fiddle Tunes for Banjo'' with [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] and [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] (Rounder, 1981)\n* ''A Robot Plane Flies over Arkansas'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1983)\n* ''Hill Country'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1985)\n* ''Alone & Together'' with [[Beppe Gambetta]] ([[Brambus Records|Brambus]], 1991)\n* ''Solo Banjo Works'' with [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1992)\n* ''[[World Turning (Tony Trischka album)|World Turning]]'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1995)\n* ''Glory Shone Around: A Christmas Collection'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1995)\n* ''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 2007)\n* ''Territory'' ([[Smithsonian Folkways]] 2008)\n* ''Great Big World'' (Rounder, 2014)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rounder.com/2014/02/new-releases/great-big-world |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316005112/http://www.rounder.com/2014/02/new-releases/great-big-world |archive-date=March 16, 2014 |title=Great Big World {{!}} Rounder Records}}</ref>\n*Of A Winter's Night (Independent, 2014)\n*The Durban Sessions (Independent, 2019)\n* ''Shall We Hope'' ([[Shefa Records]], 2021)\n* ''Earl Jam'' (2024)\n\n===With the Big Dogs===\n* ''Live at the Birchmere'' ([[Strictly Country]], 1993)\n\n===With Psychograss===\n* ''Psychograss'' ([[Windham Hill Records|Windham Hill]], 1993)\n* ''Like Minds'' ([[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hil]], 1996)\n* ''Now Hear This'' (Adventure Music America, 2005)\n\n===With [[Skyline (musical group)|Skyline]]===\n* ''Late to Work'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1981)\n* ''Stranded in the Moonlight'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1984)\n* ''Skyline Drive'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1986)\n* ''Fire of Grace'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1989)\n\n===With the Wayfaring Strangers===\n* ''Shifting Sands of Time'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 2001)\n* ''This Train'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 2003)\n\n==Television appearances==\n* ''Merv Griffin Show'', 1976\n* Nashville Network's ''Fire on the Mountain'', 1984, 1986\n* Ralph Emery's \"Frets\" Awards Show, The Nashville Network, 1987\n* CBS Hallmark Hall of Fame production of ''Foxfire'' with Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn and John Denver, 1987\n* British television production of ''Echoes of America: History of the Five String Banjo'', 1989\n* ''Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?''

Their sparse and dark musical style, which combines elements of [[Appalachian music]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]], is described by ''[[The New Yorker]]'' as \"at once innovative and obliquely reminiscent of past rural forms.\"<ref name=\"new_yorker\" />\n\nWelch and Rawlings have collaborated on nine critically acclaimed albums, five released under her name, three released under Rawlings' name, and two under both of their names.

This song exemplifies Welch and Rawlings' minimal arrangements and Welch's lyrics about outcasts}}\nAs a child, Welch was introduced to the music of American [[folk singers]] [[Bob Dylan]], [[Woody Guthrie]], and the [[Carter Family]]. She performed folk songs with her peers at the [[The Westland School (Los Angeles)|Westland Elementary School]] in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /><ref name=\"la_times_2004\"/> Welch later attended [[Crossroads School (Santa Monica, California)|Crossroads School]], a high school in [[Santa Monica, California]]. While in high school, a local television program featured her as a student who \"excelled at everything she did.\"<ref name=\"new_yorker\" />\n\nWhile a student at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], Welch played bass in a [[goth music|goth]] band, and drums in a [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] [[surf rock|surf]] band.<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /> In college, a roommate played an album by the bluegrass band [[The Stanley Brothers]], and she had an [[Epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]]:\n\n<blockquote>The first song came on and I just stood up and I kind of walked into the other room as if I was in a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo.

Not ever thinking I was thirty years too late.\"<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /> Rawlings soon followed. In Nashville, after singing \"[[Long Black Veil (song)|Long Black Veil]],\" the two first realized that their voices harmonized well and they started to perform as a duo.<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /> They never considered using a working name, so the duo were simply billed as \"Gillian Welch.\"<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /> A year after moving to Nashville, Welch found a [[Talent manager|manager]], [[Denise Stiff]], who already managed [[Alison Krauss]]. Both Welch and Stiff ignored frequent advice that Welch should stop playing with Rawlings and join a band.<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /><ref name=\"la_times_2004\" /> They eventually signed a recording contract with [[Almo Sounds]].<ref name=\"la_times_2004\" /> Following a performance opening for [[Peter Rowan]] at the [[Station Inn]], producer [[T-Bone Burnett]] expressed interest in recording an album. Burnett did not plan to disturb Welch's and Rawlings' preference for minimal instrumentation, and Welch agreed to take him on as a producer.<ref name=\"no_dep_1996\" />\n\n===''Revival''===\nFor the recording sessions of Welch's debut, ''[[Revival (Gillian Welch album)|Revival]]'', Burnett wanted to recapture the bare sound of Welch's live performance.<ref name=\"no_dep_1996\" /> Welch recalled, \"That first week was really intense. It was just T-Bone, the engineer, and Dave and myself. We got so inside our little world. There was very little distance between our singing and playing. The sound was very immediate. It was so light and small.\"<ref name=\"no_dep_1996\" /> Later, they recorded several more songs and played with an expanded group of musicians:  guitarist and [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] inductee [[James Burton]], bassist [[Roy Huskey, Jr.]], and veteran session drummers [[Jim Keltner]] and [[Buddy Harman]].<ref name=\"no_dep_1996\" />\n\nThe album was released in April 1996 to mostly positive reviews. Mark Deming of [[Allmusic]] called it a \"superb debut\" and wrote, \"Welch's debts to artists of the past are obvious and clearly acknowledged, but there's a maturity, intelligence, and keen eye for detail in her songs you wouldn't expect from someone simply trying to ape the Carter Family.\"<ref name=\"amg_revival\" /> Bill Friskics-Warren of ''[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]]'' praised the album as \"breathtakingly austere evocations of rural culture.\"<ref name=\"no_dep_1996\" /> The Arlington Heights, Illinois ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]''{{'}}s Mark Guarino observed that ''Revival'' was \"cheered and scrutinized as a staunch revivalist of Depression-era music only because her originals sounded so much like that era.\" He attributed this to the biblical imagery of the lyrics, Burnett's threadbare production, and the plainly-sung bleakness in Welch's vocals.<ref name=\"cdh_2003\" /> [[Ann Powers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave ''Revival'' a lukewarm review and criticized Welch for not singing of her own experiences, and \"manufacturing emotion.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone_revival\" /> [[Robert Christgau]] echoed Powers: Welch \"just doesn't have the voice, eye, or way with words to bring her simulation off.\"<ref name=\"robchrist_revival\" />\n\nThe song, \"Orphan Girl,\" from ''Revival'' has been covered by Emmylou Harris, Ann Wilson, Karin Bergquist of Over the Rhine, Mindy Smith, Patty Griffin, Linda Ronstadt, Tim & Mollie O'Brien and Holly Williams.\n\nOthers who have recorded Welch's songs include Joan Baez, Grace Porter, Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile, Punch Brothers, Mike Gordon, Bright Eyes, Calexico, Ani DiFranco, The Decemberists, [[Karl Blau]], Jim James, and JD Pinkus.\n\n''Revival'' was nominated for the [[Grammy Awards of 1997|1997]] [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Folk Album]], but lost to [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s ''[[The Ghost of Tom Joad]].''<ref name=\"nodep_1998\" />\n\n===''Hell Among the Yearlings''===\nThe duo's 1998 ''Hell Among the Yearlings'' continued the rustic and dark themes; the songs' subject matter varies from a female character killing a rapist, a mining accident, a [[murder ballad]], and an ode to [[morphine]] before death.<ref name=\"rs_hell\" /> Like ''Revival'', ''Hell Among The Yearlings'' featured a sparse style that focused on Rawlings and Welch's voices and guitars.<ref name=\"rs_hell\" /><ref name=\"wsj_1998\" />\n\n[[File:Gillian Welch 2007.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Welch singing and playing guitar on stage, wearing a black dress.|Welch performing at the 2007 New Orleans [[Jazz&nbsp;Fest]]]] \nThe album also received favorable reviews.

People would flat-out ask me, 'Don't you have any happy love songs?' Well, as a matter of fact, I don't. I've got songs about orphans and morphine addicts.\"<ref name=\"times_london_2003\" /> To reflect these themes, Welch and Rawlings often employ a slow pace to their songs. Their tempo is compared to a \"slow heartbeat\", and Cowperthwait of ''Rolling Stone'' observed that their songs \"can lull you into near-hypnosis and then make your jaw drop with one final revelation\".<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /><ref name=\"rs_1998\" />\n\n===Reception===\n[[File:Gillian welch.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.66|alt=Welch in a green tanktop sings into a microphone while playing guitar.|Welch performing at the 2009 [[Newport&nbsp;Folk&nbsp;Festival]]]]\n[[Geoffrey Himes]] of ''The Washington Post'' described Welch as \"one of the most interesting singer-songwriters of her generation\".<ref name=\"wash_post_2001\" /> In 2003, Tom Kielty of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' observed that she was \"quietly establishing one of the most impressive catalogs in contemporary roots music\", and a 2007 piece in ''The Guardian'' by John Harris called Welch \"one of the decade's greatest talents\".<ref name=\"guardian_2007\" /><ref name=\"boston_2003\" /> Critic [[Robert Hilburn]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, \"At every turn, she demonstrates a spark and commitment that should endear her to anyone from country and folk to pop and rock fans who appreciate imagination and heart.\"<ref name=\"latimes_1996\" />\n\nWhen Welch's first two albums came out, critics questioned the authenticity of her music, as she was raised in [[Southern California]], but performed [[Appalachia]]n themed songs.<ref name=\"theage_bevhillybilly\" /><ref name=\"wsj_1998\" /><ref name=\"boston_globe_1998\" /> For ''Revival'', Welch was criticized for \"manufacturing emotion\", and a review of ''Hell Among the Yearlings'' by Chris Herrington of ''City Pages'' stated, \"Welch is someone who discovered old-time music in college and decided that her own sheltered life could never be worth writing about\", and that she is \"completely devoid of individuality\".<ref name=\"rollingstone_revival\" /><ref name=\"minn_city_pages\" /> Other critics rejected the notion that her background affects the authenticity of her music. Music critic [[Mark Kemp]] defended Welch in a ''[[New York Times]]'' piece:\n\n<blockquote>The first-person protagonist of Ms. Welch's song (\"Caleb Meyer\") may be a young girl from a time and place that Ms. Welch will never fully understand, but the feelings the singer expresses about rape, and the respect she displays for her chosen musical genre, are nothing if not poignantly authentic. Likewise, it matters not whether Ms. Welch has ever walked the streets of \"the black dust towns of [[East Tennessee]]\" about which she sings in \"Miner's Refrain\" because the sense of foreboding that she expresses for the men who once labored in coal mines with futile hopes of a better life comes through loud and clear.<ref name=\"nyt_1998\" /> </blockquote>\n\n''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'''s Taylor Holliday echoed this: \"Stingy critics give Ms. Welch a hard time because she's a California city girl, not an Appalachian coal miner's daughter. But as [[Lucinda Williams|Lucinda]] or Emmylou might attest, love of the music is not a birthright, but an earned right. Listen to Ms. Welch yodel, in a tune about that no-good \"gal\" Morphine, and you know she's as mountain as they come.\"<ref name=\"wsj_1998\" />\n\nOn September 16, 2015, the duo was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting by the Americana Music Association.\n\n===Influences and collaborations===\n[[File:Bob Weir & Gillian Welch.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A bearded man who looks to be in his 60s wearing a dark red shirt and Welch, smiling, with her arm around him.

She said that \"by and large I listen to people who are dead. I'm really of the tried-and-true school. I let 50 years go by and see what's really relevant.\"<ref name=\"boston_globe_1998\" /> Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the [[Carter Family]], the [[Louvin Brothers]], and the [[Blue Sky Boys]].<ref name=\"new_yorker\" /><ref name=\"nyt_feb_2004\" /> She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, \"I've never tried to be traditional.

The band consists of [[Natalie Maines]] (lead vocals, guitar, bass guitar) and sisters [[Martie Maguire]] (vocals, fiddle, [[mandolin]], guitar) and [[Emily Strayer]] (vocals, guitar, banjo, [[Dobro]]). Maguire and Strayer, both n\u00e9e Erwin, founded the band in 1989, with bassist Laura Lynch and vocalist and guitarist Robin Lynn Macy. They performed [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[country music]], [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits and small venues for six years without attracting a [[major label]]. In 1992, Lynch replaced Macy as the lead vocalist.\n\nAfter releasing three independent albums, the Dixie Chicks signed to [[Monument Records|Monument Records Nashville]] in 1997, by which point Maines had joined. They achieved success with their albums ''[[Wide Open Spaces (album)|Wide Open Spaces]]'' (1998) and ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' (1999). After Monument closed its Nashville branch, the Dixie Chicks moved to [[Columbia Records]] for ''[[Home (Dixie Chicks album)|Home]]'' (2002). These albums achieved [[multi-platinum]] sales in the United States, Canada, and Australia, along with several charting singles on the American ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts. Their successful US singles were \"[[There's Your Trouble]]\", \"[[Wide Open Spaces (song)|Wide Open Spaces]]\", \"[[You Were Mine]]\", \"[[Cowboy Take Me Away]]\", \"[[Without You (Dixie Chicks song)|Without You]]\", and a cover of [[Bruce Robison]]'s \"[[Travelin' Soldier]]\". The Dixie Chicks also reached number one on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart with their 2002 cover of [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s \"[[Landslide (Fleetwood Mac song)|Landslide]]\".\n\nDays before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Maines [[Dixie Chicks comments on George W. Bush|told a London audience that the Dixie Chicks did not endorse the war]] and were ashamed of US President [[George W. Bush]] being from Texas. The remarks triggered boycotts in the US and a backlash from fans. After a hiatus, the Dixie Chicks recorded ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'' in 2006, an album informed by the backlash. \"[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]\" became their biggest crossover single, reaching number four on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. After a second hiatus, Maguire and Strayer recorded as a duo called [[Court Yard Hounds]]. The Dixie Chicks reunited to tour in the 2010s. In 2020, they removed \"[[Dixie]]\" from their name due to negative connotations, and released their first album in 14 years, ''[[Gaslighter (album)|Gaslighter]].''\n\nThe Chicks have won 13 [[Grammy Award]]s, including five in 2007 for ''Taking the Long Way,'' which received the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]], and its single \"[[Not Ready to Make Nice]]\", which received the [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] and the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]].
