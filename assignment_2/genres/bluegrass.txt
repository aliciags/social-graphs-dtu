Sonny went to work with the \"Father of Bluegrass Music\" [[Bill Monroe]]. Following Bobby's discharge, the Osbornes teamed up with [[Jimmy Martin]], performing at radio stations WROL in [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] and [[WJR]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].<ref name=t238>Tribe 2006, p.&nbsp;238.</ref><ref name=o2>Osborne 1964, p.&nbsp;2.</ref> At their only session together, on November 16, 1954, the Osbornes and Martin recorded six songs for RCA Victor.<ref>Booklet, Bear Family Records BCD 15705</ref> In late 1955, the Osbornes left Martin and moved to [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], where they performed on [[WWVA Jamboree]] until Christmas, together with Charlie Bailey.<ref name=r155>Rosenberg 2005, p.&nbsp;155.</ref> They returned to Dayton in early 1956 playing the local clubs with guitarist Enos Johnson. When Johnson left, the Osbornes added guitarist [[Red Allen (bluegrass)|Red Allen]] and fiddler Art Stamper to form a new group.\n\nThe Osborne Brothers and Red Allen (under the pseudonym Stanley Alpine) recorded for Gateway Records in February or March 1956 cutting eight instrumentals. In the spring of 1956, Tommy Sutton, a local disc jockey, helped the Osborne Brothers get a recording contract with [[MGM Records]].<ref name=g67>Goldsmith 2004, p.&nbsp;67.</ref> The new group, with the Osbornes on banjo and mandolin, Allen on guitar, Ernie Newton on bass, Tommy Jackson and Art Stamper on fiddles, made their MGM recording debut on July 1, 1956.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Booklet, Bear Family Records BCD 15598</ref> Their first released 45 RPM single for MGM containing \"Ruby Are You Mad\" became a huge success and led to the Osbornes being signed on as regular members of the WWVA Jamboree in October 1956.<ref name=r155/><ref name=g68>Goldsmith 2004, p.&nbsp;68.</ref> The \"Jamboree version\" of the group comprised Ricky Russell on dobro, Johnny Dacus on fiddle and Ray Anderson on bass. \"Ruby Are You Mad\" marks the first time twin banjos were used on a bluegrass recording.<ref name=g68/> On October 17, 1957, at their third session for MGM, the Osbornes, always experimenting with their sound, added a dobro and drums, also for the first time on a bluegrass recording. In April 1958, Red Allen, who was the last musician to receive billing next to the Osborne Brothers, left the group.<ref name=g69>Goldsmith 2004, p.&nbsp;69.</ref>\n\nUpon their breaking into the bluegrass scene, the Osborne Brothers quickly became known for their virtuoso instrumentation and tight, melodic vocal harmonies. They first made the country chart in 1958 with \"Once More\", performing as a trio with [[Red Allen (bluegrass)|Red Allen]]. The song featured a novel inverted stacked harmony. Bobby sang the lead line highest, with Sonny singing baritone, and the third singer (Red Allen) singing tenor as the lowest part. This made Bobby's distinctive voice the lead, and the third voice was somewhat interchangeable. As a result, they could hire others guitarist and singers without changing the overall sound. The \"high lead\" vocal trio became their signature, and they used to great effect in the country market with songs like \"Blame Me\", \"Sweethearts Again\", and a remake of the Carter Family's \"Fair and Tender Ladies\".\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Osbornes caused minor controversy among Bluegrass music purists by incorporating electronic and percussion instruments in their live acts and studio work. In 1960 they became the first bluegrass group to play on a college campus, performing at Antioch College.<ref name=wd243>Wolff, Duane 2000, p.&nbsp;243.</ref> In 1963 they signed with [[Decca Records]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> On August 8, 1964, the Osborne Brothers were inducted as members of the [[Grand Ole Opry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.opry.com/MeetTheOpry/Members.aspx?id=116|title=Grand Ole Opry: Members|website=Opry.com|access-date=August 8, 2021|archive-date=September 11, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911013352/http://www.opry.com/MeetTheOpry/Members.aspx?id=116|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Osborne Brothers recorded their hit \u201cRocky Top\u201d in November 1967.

Kentucky Colonels==\n{{main|Kentucky Colonels (band)}}\nFollowing the recording sessions for the Country Boys' debut album, the band changed its name to the [[Kentucky Colonels (band)|Kentucky Colonels]] in September 1962, at the suggestion of country guitarist and friend [[Joe Maphis]].<ref name=\"hjort\"/>  The band's album was released by Briar International under the title ''The New

music.<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/>  After attending a performance by [[Doc Watson]] at the [[Ash Grove (music club)|Ash Grove]] folk club in Los Angeles, where he also met the guitarist, Clarence began to explore the possibilities of the acoustic guitar's role in bluegrass music.<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/>  At that time, the guitar was largely regarded as a rhythm instrument in bluegrass, with only a few performers, such as  Watson, exploring its potential for soloing.<ref name=\"Kingsbury\"/>  White soon began to integrate elements of Watson's playing style\u2014including the use of open strings and syncopation\u2014into his own flatpicking guitar technique.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>  His breathtaking speed and virtuosity on the instrument<ref name=\"timeless2\"/> was largely responsible for making the guitar a lead instrument within bluegrass.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-guitarists-1234814010/clarence-white-3-1234814623/|title=250 Greatest

and made many live appearances throughout California and the United States.<ref name=\"hjort\"/>  Between bookings with the Colonels, White also made a guest appearance on [[Eric Weissberg]] and [[Marshall Brickman]]'s ''New Dimensions in Banjo & Bluegrass'' album, which would be re-released in 1973 as the [[soundtrack album]] to the film ''[[Deliverance]]'' (with Weissberg and Steve Mandell's version of \"[[Dueling Banjos]]\" added to the album's track listing).<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/><ref>{{Cite

appearances at various clubs, concert halls and festivals.<ref name=\"hjort\"/> The Colonels' second album, ''[[Appalachian Swing!]]'',<ref name=\"timeless2\"/> was a commercial success and saw

Taylor]] on a Dobro-themed album that was released by World Pacific Records in late 1964 as ''Dobro Country''.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>  Although the brothers were employed as session musicians, the album was credited to Tut Taylor, Roland and Clarence White upon release.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>\n\nAlthough the Colonels were a successful recording act, it was becoming increasingly difficult for them to make a living, due to the waning popularity of the [[American folk music revival]] due to the [[British Invasion]] and homegrown [[folk rock]] acts, such as [[the Byrds]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/>  As a result, the Colonels switched to [[electric instrument]]ation<ref name=\"byrdwatcher\"/> and hired a [[drummer]].<ref>{{Cite

spite of these changes, the Kentucky Colonels dissolved as a band following a show on October 31, 1965.<ref name=\"timeless2\"/>  Clarence, Roland and Eric Jr. formed a new line-up of the Colonels in 1966, with several other musicians, but this second version of the group was short-lived and by early 1967 they had broken up.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\">{{cite

work (1966\u20131968)==\nDuring 1964, White began to look beyond bluegrass music towards [[rock 'n' roll]] as an avenue for artistic expression.<ref name=\"timeless\"/>  Although he was influenced by Country guitarists like [[Doc Watson]], [[Don Reno]] and [[Joe Maphis]], he also idolized the playing of [[jazz guitarist]] [[Django Reinhardt]], rock 'n' roller [[Chuck Berry]], and studio musician [[James Burton]].<ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/>  White even anticipated the viability of a folk/rock hybrid when, in the summer of 1964, he was approached by Jim Dickson to record a version of the then-unreleased Bob Dylan song \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" with electric instruments.<ref name=\"timeless\"/>  However, despite White's enthusiasm for the project, he was unable to convince his bandmates in the Kentucky Colonels of the experiment's validity<ref name=\"timeless\"/> and ultimately, the song was instead recorded by Dickson's proteges, the Byrds.<ref>{{cite

Press|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-313-33845-8}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the original line-up of the Kentucky Colonels folded in late 1965, White had become a respected and well-known guitarist.<ref name=\"timeless\"/>  Abandoning bluegrass temporarily, he switched from his [[Martin D-28]] acoustic guitar to an electric [[Fender Telecaster]], with the intention of becoming a studio musician like his hero James Burton.<ref name=\"lightning\"/>  Transitioning to electric guitar required White to modify his right hand playing technique, switch from [[open chord]]ing to [[fret]]ting the whole [[Neck (music)|guitar neck]] with his left hand, and practice using the tone and volume controls.<ref name=\"lightning\"/>  However, he soon mastered the intricacies of the instrument and, between 1965 and 1968, he undertook session work for artists including [[Ricky Nelson]], [[the Monkees]], and the [[Vern Gosdin|Gosdin Brothers]].<ref name=\"timeless\"/><ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/> \n  \nAs 1965 turned into 1966, White met [[Gene Parsons]] and [[Gib Guilbeau]] at a recording session for the Gosdin Brothers and, shortly after, he began to perform live with the duo in local California clubs, as well as doing regular session work on their records, which were released under the moniker of Cajun Gib and Gene.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/>  1966 also saw White begin playing with a country group called Trio, which featured drummer Bart Haney and former Kentucky Colonel, Roger Bush, on bass.<ref name=\"byrdwatcher2\"/>  In autumn of that year, as a result of his friendship with Gilbeau, Parsons and the Gosdin Brothers, White was asked to provide [[lead guitar]] to ex-Byrd [[Gene Clark]]'s debut solo album, ''[[Gene Clark with the Gosdin Brothers]]''.<ref

\"Time Between\" and \"The Girl with No Name\", which both appeared on the Byrds' ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'' album.<ref name=\"hjort3\"/>  The country-oriented nature of the songs was something of

Prior to the advent of the more aggressive flatpicking style pioneered by guitarists like Watson and White, the guitar was strictly a rhythm instrument, save for a few exceptions (such as the occasional guitar track by banjoist [[Don Reno]]). Many of the most influential flatpickers of the 20th century cite White as a primary influence, including [[Dan Crary]], [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]], and [[Tony Rice]].  Rice owned and played White's highly modified 1935 [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] D-28. [[David Grier]] and [[Russ Barenberg]] are two other acoustic guitarists who were heavily influenced by White's guitar work.  White's bluegrass playing with the Kentucky Colonels was also a considerable influence on [[Jerry Garcia]] of the [[Grateful Dead]],<ref name=\"lightning\"/> who traveled with the band during 1964.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Livin' in the Past|others=[[Kentucky Colonels]]|year=2003|first=John|last=Delgatto|page=2|type=CD booklet|publisher=Sierra Records|location=Pasadena}}</ref>\n\nOn the electric side of the guitar spectrum, White was similarly influential.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Together with fellow Byrds bandmember [[Gene Parsons]], White invented the [[B-Bender]] device. This device raises the B-string (second string) of the guitar a whole step by the use of pulleys and levers attached to both the upper strap knob and the second string on the guitar. It is activated by pushing down on the neck, and produces a \"[[pedal steel]]\" type sound. [[Arlen Roth]], heavily influenced by this style, did not at the time know that White and Parsons had invented a B-bender, so instead developed his own unique all-finger bending version of this technique. This was heavily documented in his ground-breaking book, \"Nashville Guitar\", all of his recordings, as well as his book \"Masters of the Telecaster\". Subsequently, his [[Telecaster]] sound became as notable as his bluegrass playing. [[Marty Stuart]], another guitarist influenced by White's playing, now owns and regularly plays White's 1954 [[Fender Telecaster]] with the prototype B-Bender.<ref>[http://www.martystuart.com/ZArt-GuitarPlayer8-94.htm] Gill, Chris: \"Steel And Wood, Heart And Soul - The Marty Stuart Guitar Collection,\" reprinted from ''Guitar Player Magazine'', August 1994.</ref>\n\nMusic archivist and writer [[Alec Palao]] has called White \"one of a handful of true greats amongst the instrumentalists of 20th century popular music\", before adding that \"the waves created by the guitarist's idiosyncratic style are still forming ripples within bluegrass, country and rock 'n' roll.\"<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Tuff & Stringy: Sessions 1966-68|chapter=Part One: Sometimes the Journey Can Be as Interesting as the Destination|others=Clarence White|year=2003|last=Palao|first=Alec|page=4|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[Ace Records (United Kingdom)|Ace Records]]|location=London}}</ref>  In 2003, White was ranked No.&nbsp;41 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.

The band seldom had a [[fiddle]] player, but was often asked to play at [[square dance]]s. Following the example of country guitarists [[Grady Martin]] and [[Hank Garland]], Watson taught himself to play fiddle tunes on his [[Gibson Les Paul]] electric guitar.

As popular as ever, Doc and Merle began playing as a trio with [[T. Michael Coleman]] on bass guitar in 1974.

His guitar playing skills, combined with his authenticity as a mountain musician, made him a highly influential figure during the folk music revival. He pioneered a fast and flashy [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] lead guitar style including fiddle tunes and [[crosspicking]] techniques which were adopted and extended by [[Clarence White]], [[Tony Rice]] and many others. Watson was also an accomplished banjo player and sometimes accompanied himself on harmonica as well. Known also for his distinctive and rich [[baritone]] voice, Watson over the years developed a vast repertoire of mountain [[ballad]]s, which he learned via the [[oral tradition]] of his home area in [[Deep Gap, North Carolina]].\n\nWatson played a [[C.F. Martin & Company|Martin]] model D-18 guitar on his earliest recordings. In 1968, Watson began a relationship with Gallagher Guitars when he started playing their G-50 model. His first Gallagher, which Watson referred to as \"Ol' Hoss\", was on display at the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] before residing at the Gallagher shop until 2012, when it was auctioned through [[Christie's]] on November 27, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Release: Christie's to Offer a Range of Fine Musical Instruments in November from Italian Masters to Contemporary Classics |url=https://www.christies.com/about-us/press-archive/details?PressReleaseID=5934&lid=1&mob-is-app=false |access-date=2022-07-23 |website=www.christies.com |language=en}}</ref> In 1974, Gallagher created a customized G-50 line to meet Watson's preferred specifications, which bears the Doc Watson name.

Another of Watson's favorites was his Arnold guitar, \"The Jimmie\", built by luthier John Arnold as a tribute to the famous 1926 Martin 00-18 played by [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]].\n\nIn 1994, Watson teamed with musicians [[Randy Scruggs]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] to contribute the classic song \"[[Keep on the Sunny Side]]\" to the AIDS benefit album [[Red Hot + Country]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n===Later life===\n[[File:Merlewatson.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Merle Watson, c. 1979]]\n\nIn his later life, Watson scaled back his touring schedule. He was generally joined onstage by his grandson (Merle's son) Richard, as well as longtime musical partners [[David Holt (musician)|David Holt]] or [[Jack Lawrence (bluegrass)|Jack Lawrence]]. On June 19, 2007, Watson was accompanied by Australian guitar player [[Tommy Emmanuel]] at a concert at the [[Bass Performance Hall]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. Watson also performed, accompanied by Holt and Richard, at the [[Hardly Strictly Bluegrass]] festival in [[San Francisco]] in 2009, as he had done for several previous festivals.\n\nWatson hosted the annual [[MerleFest]] music festival held every April at [[Wilkes Community College]] in [[Wilkesboro, North Carolina]]. The festival features a vast array of acoustic style music focusing on the folk, bluegrass, [[blues]] and old-time music genres. It was named in honor of Merle Watson and is one of the most popular acoustic music festivals in the world, drawing over 70,000 music fans each year.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/obit/story/2012-05-29/doc-watson-dies/55271498/1 | title=Doc Watson, folk music legend, dies at 89 | work=[[USA Today]] | date=May 30, 2012 | access-date=May 30, 2012 | last=Mansfield | first=Brian | archive-date=May 30, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530103832/http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/obit/story/2012-05-29/doc-watson-dies/55271498/1 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The festival has continued after his death.\n\nWatson was inducted into the [[North Carolina Music Hall of Fame]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=2010 Inductees|url=http://northcarolinamusichalloffame.org/category/inductees/2010-inductees/|publisher=North Carolina Music Hall of Fame|access-date=September 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1947, Watson married Rosa Lee Carlton, the daughter of popular fiddle player [[Gaither Carlton]].

When he was two, his family started going to That Pizza Place, where he listened to John Moore's band Bluegrass Etc. When Thile was four, his family moved to [[Idyllwild, California]].\n\nThile began playing the mandolin at the age of five, taking occasional lessons from John Moore. At age eight, Thile's family and the Watkins family formed [[Nickel Creek]]. The band performed at many California bluegrass festivals, and as a result Chris had to be [[homeschooling|home-schooled]]. At age twelve, he won the mandolin championship at the [[Walnut Valley Festival]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]].\n\nThat same year, 1993, Thile made a demo tape and sent it to the Sugar Hill and Rounder record labels.

The group was founded as a side project by record producer and session musician Scott Rouse in 1987, after he began experimenting with dance mixes of bluegrass and country songs, eventually applying the term groovegrass to his mix of music. He then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], and joined several other country musicians and funk bass guitarist [[Bootsy Collins]], releasing a country version of [[Los del R\u00edo]]'s \"[[Macarena]]\" and two albums. The country cover of \"Macarena\" charted on both the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100]], and was the group's only chart entry.\n\n==History==\nRouse, a [[session musician]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], first came up with the idea of GrooveGrass in the mid-1980s when he began experimenting with dance mixes of bluegrass songs such as [[Alton Delmore]]'s \"Deep River Blues\". His mixes became popular at local clubs, eventually leading to one disc jockey terming the blend of music \"groovegrass\".<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p350665/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=GrooveGrass biography |accessdate=2008-08-21 |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref>\n\nRouse then moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], at the request of his friend, musician [[Doc Watson]].

He described the genre as \"Scottish [[bagpipes]] and ole-time fiddlin'. It's Methodist and Holiness and Baptist. It's blues and [[jazz]], and it has a high lonesome sound.\"<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bill Monroe |website=2022 Monroe Mandolin Camp |url=https://monroemandolincamp.com/bill-monroe/ |access-date=2022-11-12 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nMonroe was born on [[Bill Monroe Farm|his family's farm]] near [[Rosine, Kentucky]], the youngest of eight children of James Buchanan \"Buck\" and Malissa (Vandiver) Monroe. His mother and her brother, [[Pendleton Vandiver|James Pendleton \"Pen\" Vandiver]], were both musically talented, and Monroe and his family grew up playing and singing at home.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nBill was of [[Scottish Americans|Scottish]] and [[English Americans|English]] heritage. Because his older brothers Birch and [[Charlie Monroe|Charlie]] already played the [[fiddle]] and [[guitar]], Bill was resigned to playing the less desirable [[mandolin]].<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> He recalled that his brothers insisted that he remove four of the mandolin's eight strings so he would not play too loudly.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nMonroe's mother died when he was ten, and his father died six years later.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Eventually, his brothers and sisters moved away, leaving Monroe to bounce between uncles and aunts until finally settling in with his disabled uncle Pendleton Vandiver, whom he often accompanied when Vandiver played the fiddle at dances. This experience inspired one of Monroe's most famous compositions, \"Uncle Pen\", recorded in 1950,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> and the 1972 album ''Bill Monroe's Uncle Pen.'' On that album, Monroe recorded a number of traditional fiddle tunes he had often heard performed by Vandiver. Vandiver has been credited with giving Monroe \"a repertoire of tunes that sank into Bill's aurally trained memory and a sense of rhythm that seeped into his bones.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=Smith |first=Richard D. |url=https://archive.org/details/cantyouhearmecal00smit/ |title=Can't You Hear Me Callin': the Life of Bill Monroe, Father of Bluegrass |date= |publisher=[[Da Capo Press]] |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-316-80381-6 |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] |page=27 |language=en |oclc=42690222 |url-access=registration}}</ref>\n\nAlso significant in Monroe's musical life was [[Arnold Shultz]], an influential [[fiddle]]r and guitarist who introduced Monroe to the [[blues]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Bluegrass Breakdown: The Making of the Old Southern Sound|author=Robert Cantwell|publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]|date=2003|isbn=9780252071171|pages=30\u201332}}</ref><ref>''The Father of Bluegrass Music'', DVD Documentary (1993)</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nIn 1929, Monroe moved to [[Indiana]] to work at an oil refinery with his brothers [[Birch Monroe|Birch]] and Charlie.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Together with a friend, Larry Moore, they formed the \"Monroe Brothers\", to play at local dances and house parties.\n\nBirch and Moore soon left the group, and Bill and Charlie carried on as a duo, eventually winning spots performing live on radio stations, first in Indiana and then, sponsored by Texas Crystals, on several radio broadcasts in [[Shenandoah, Iowa]], [[Nebraska]], [[South Carolina]] and [[North Carolina]] from 1934 to 1936.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> [[RCA Records#Previous labels|RCA Victor]] signed the Monroe Brothers to a recording contract in 1936.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> They scored an immediate hit single with the gospel song \"What Would You Give in Exchange For Your Soul?\" and ultimately recorded 60 tracks for Victor's [[Bluebird Records|Bluebird]] label between 1936 and 1938.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Monroe: American Musician|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Monroe|website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=January 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAfter the Monroe Brothers disbanded in 1938, Bill Monroe formed The Kentuckians in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]], but the group only lasted for three months.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Monroe then left Little Rock for [[Atlanta, Georgia]], to form the first edition of the Blue Grass Boys,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> with singer/guitarist [[Cleo Davis]], fiddler Art Wooten, and bassist [[Amos Garren]].\n\nIn October 1939, Monroe successfully auditioned for a regular spot on the [[Grand Ole Opry]], impressing Opry founder [[George D. Hay]] with his energetic performance of [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]'s \"[[Mule Skinner Blues]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Monroe recorded that song, along with seven others, at his first solo recording session for RCA Victor in 1940; by this time, the Blue Grass Boys consisted of singer/guitarist [[Clyde Moody]], fiddler Tommy Magness, and bassist Bill Wesbrooks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://doodah.net/bgb/|title=Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys|website=Doodah.net|access-date=January 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWhile the fast tempos and instrumental virtuosity characteristic of bluegrass music are apparent even on these early tracks, Monroe was still experimenting with the sound of his group. He seldom sang lead vocals on his Victor recordings, often preferring to contribute high tenor harmonies as he had in the Monroe Brothers. A 1945 session for [[Columbia Records]] featured an [[accordion]], soon dropped from the band. Most importantly, Monroe added [[banjo]] player [[David \"Stringbean\" Akeman]] to the Blue Grass Boys in 1942.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Akeman played the instrument in a relatively primitive style and was rarely featured in instrumental solos. Monroe's pre-1946 recordings represent a transitional style between the [[string band|string-band tradition]] from which he came and the musical innovation to follow.\n\n== \"Original Bluegrass Band\" and Monroe's heyday as a star ==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=September 2022}}\nKey developments occurred in Monroe's music with the addition of [[Lester Flatt]] and [[Earl Scruggs]] to the Blue Grass Boys in December 1945.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Flatt played a solid rhythm guitar style that would help to set the course for bluegrass timing. Scruggs played the banjo with a distinctive three-finger picking style that immediately caused a sensation among Opry audiences. Flatt and Scruggs joined a highly accomplished group that included fiddler Howdy Forrester and bassist Joe Forrester and would soon include fiddler [[Chubby Wise]] and bassist [[Howard Watts]], who often performed under the name \"Cedric Rainwater\".\n\nIn retrospect, this line-up of the Blue Grass Boys has been dubbed the \"Original Bluegrass Band\", as the music finally included all the elements that characterize bluegrass music, including breakneck tempos, sophisticated vocal harmony arrangements, and impressive instrumental proficiency demonstrated in solos or \"breaks\" on the mandolin, banjo, and fiddle. By this time, Monroe had acquired the 1923 Gibson F5 model \"Lloyd Loar\" mandolin, which became his trademark instrument for the remainder of his career.<ref>Rosenberg, Neil V. (2005). ''BLUEGRASS: A History''. Urbana, Ill.: University of Illinois Press; {{ISBN|0-252-07245-6}}</ref>\n\nThe 28 songs recorded by this version of the Blue Grass Boys for Columbia Records in 1946 and 1947 soon became classics of the genre, including \"Toy Heart\", \"Blue Grass Breakdown\", \"[[Molly and Tenbrooks]]\", \"Wicked Path of Sin\", \"My Rose of Old Kentucky\", \"Little Cabin Home on the Hill\", and Monroe's most famous song \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\",<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> which was recorded by [[Elvis Presley]] in 1954, appearing as the B-side of his first single for [[Sun Records]]. Monroe gave his blessing to Presley's [[rock and roll]] cover of the song, originally a slow [[ballad]] in [[waltz]] time, and re-recorded it himself with a faster arrangement after Presley's version became a hit.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Several gospel-themed numbers are credited to the \"Blue Grass Quartet\", which featured four-part vocal arrangements accompanied solely by mandolin and guitar \u2013 Monroe's usual practice when performing \"sacred\" songs.\n\nBoth Flatt and Scruggs left Monroe's band in early 1948, soon forming their own group, the [[Foggy Mountain Boys]]. In 1949, after signing with Decca Records, Monroe entered what has been called the \"golden age\" of his career<ref>''Bill Monroe and Bluegrass'' by Roughstock staff, January 27, 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.roughstock.com/history/bill-monroe-and-bluegrass/ |title=Roughstock's History of Country Music - Bill Monroe and Bluegrass |access-date=June 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620032558/http://www.roughstock.com/history/bill-monroe-and-bluegrass/ |archive-date=June 20, 2009  }}</ref> with what many consider the classic \"high lonesome\" version of the Blue Grass Boys, featuring the lead vocals and rhythm guitar of [[Jimmy Martin]], the banjo of [[Rudy Lyle]] (replacing [[Don Reno]]), and fiddlers such as Merle \"Red\" Taylor, [[Charlie Cline]], [[Bobby Hicks]], and [[Vassar Clements]].\n\nThis band recorded a number of bluegrass classics, including \"My Little Georgia Rose\", \"On and On\", \"Memories of Mother and Dad\", and \"Uncle Pen\", as well as instrumentals such as \"Roanoke\", \"Big Mon\", \"Stoney Lonesome\", \"Get Up John\", and the mandolin feature \"Raw Hide\". [[Carter Stanley]] joined the Blue Grass Boys as guitarist for a short time in 1951 during a period when [[The Stanley Brothers]] had temporarily disbanded.\n\nOn January 16, 1953, Monroe was critically injured in a two-car wreck.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> He and \"Bluegrass Boys\" bass player, [[Bessie Lee Mauldin]], were returning home from a fox hunt north of [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. On highway 31-W, near White House, their car was struck by a drunken driver. Monroe, who had suffered injuries to his back, left arm and nose, was rushed to General Hospital in Nashville. It took him almost four months to recover and resume touring.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> In the meantime [[Charlie Cline]] and [[Jimmy Martin]] kept the band together.<ref name=\"Rosenberg\"/>{{Page needed|date=May 2024}}\n\nBy the late 1950s, however, Monroe's commercial fortunes had begun to slip.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> The rise of rock-and-roll and the development of the \"[[Nashville sound]]\" in mainstream [[country music]] both represented threats to the viability of bluegrass. While still a mainstay on the Grand Ole Opry, Monroe found diminishing success on the singles charts, and struggled to keep his band together in the face of declining demand for live performances.\n\n==Folk revival==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}\nMonroe's fortunes began to improve during the [[American folk music revival]] of the early 1960s. Many college students and other young people were beginning to discover Monroe, associating his style more with traditional folk music than with the country-and-western genre with which it had previously been identified.\n\nThe word \"bluegrass\" first appeared around this time to describe the sound of Monroe and similar artists such as Flatt and Scruggs, the Stanley Brothers, [[Reno and Smiley]], [[Jim & Jesse|Jim and Jesse]], and the [[Osborne Brothers]]. While Flatt and Scruggs immediately recognized the potential for a lucrative new audience in cities and on college campuses in the North, Monroe was slower to respond. Under the influence of [[Ralph Rinzler]], a young musician and folklorist from New Jersey who briefly became Monroe's manager in 1963, Monroe gradually expanded his geographic reach beyond the traditional southern country music circuit.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Rinzler was also responsible for a lengthy profile and interview in the influential folk music magazine ''[[Sing Out!]]'' that first publicly referred to Monroe as the \"father\" of bluegrass. Accordingly, at the first bluegrass festival organized by Carlton Haney at [[Roanoke, Virginia]] in 1965, Bill Monroe was the central figure.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/>\n\nIn 1964, before the [[Grateful Dead]] got together, [[Jerry Garcia]] caravanned across the country from California to tag along with Monroe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gardenandgun.com/articles/jerry-garcias-bluegrass-roots/|title=Jerry Garcia's Bluegrass Roots|date=May 3, 2018|website=Gardenandgun.com|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThe growing national popularity of Monroe's music during the 1960s was also apparent in the increasingly diverse background of musicians recruited into his band. Non-southerners who served as Blue Grass Boys during this period included banjo player [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] and singer/guitarist [[Peter Rowan]] from Massachusetts,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> fiddler Gene Lowinger from New Jersey, banjo player Lamar Grier from Maryland, banjo player Steve Arkin from New York, and singer/guitarist [[Roland White]] and fiddler [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]] from California.\n\n==Later years==\n[[File:Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Hall of Fame Museum - June 2022 - Sarah Stierch.jpg|thumb|Bill Monroe's Bluegrass Hall of Fame Museum in [[Morgantown, Indiana]]. He founded the Hall in 1984.]]\nEven after the folk revival faded in the mid-1960s, it left a loyal audience for bluegrass music. Bluegrass festivals became common, with fans often traveling long distances to see a number of different acts over several days of performances.\n\nIn 1967, Monroe himself founded an annual bluegrass festival at [[Beanblossom, Indiana|Bean Blossom]] in southern Indiana, a park he had purchased in 1951,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> which routinely attracted a crowd of thousands; a double LP from the festival featuring Monroe, Jimmy Martin, Lester Flatt, and Jim and Jesse was released in 1973. The annual ''Bill Monroe Bean Blossom Bluegrass Festival'' is now the world's oldest continuously running annual bluegrass festival.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/loc.afc.afc-legacies.200002995/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905004417/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/diglib/legacies/IN/200002995.html|url-status=dead|title=Bill Monroe Bluegrass Festival in Brown County|first=Representative (9th District) Baron P.

Monroe recorded two albums of duets in the 1980s; the first featured collaborations with country stars such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Waylon Jennings]], and [[The Oak Ridge Boys]], while the second paired him with other prominent bluegrass musicians.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> A 1989 live album celebrated his 50th year on the Grand Ole Opry.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Monroe also kept a hectic touring schedule.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> On April 7, 1990, Monroe performed for [[Farm Aid|Farm Aid IV]] in [[Indianapolis]], Indiana along with [[Willie Nelson]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Neil Young]] and with many other artists.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mitchell |first=Dawn |date=18 June 2007 |title=RetroIndy: Farm Aid IV raised a bumper crop of cash |url=https://www.indystar.com/story/news/history/retroindy/2017/06/18/farm-aid-iv-raised-bumper-crop-cash/395865001/ |access-date=2024-05-08 |website=[[The Indianapolis Star]] |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=== Death ===\nMonroe's last performance occurred on March 15, 1996.

In 2003, [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] had Bill Monroe ranked No.&nbsp;16 on ''CMT 40 Greatest Men of Country Music''.\n\nArtists that claimed to be influenced by or to be playing the bluegrass genre were often bullied by Bill Monroe. He always considered himself the father and caretaker of bluegrass. He would often say of new bands that did not perform to his standards, \"That ain't no part of nothin'.\" Even those who question the scope of bluegrass refer to Monroe as a \"musical giant\" and recognize that \"there would be no bluegrass without Bill Monroe.\"<ref>{{cite news|author=Teachout, Terry|title=Kentucky Troubadour: A biography of Bill Monroe and the bluegrass music he invented.|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 2001|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/09/17/reviews/000917.17teachot.html|access-date=January 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nMore than 150 musicians played in the Blue Grass Boys over the nearly 60 years of Monroe's performing career. Monroe tended to recruit promising young musicians who served an apprenticeship with him before becoming accomplished artists in their own right. Some of Monroe's band members who went on to greater prominence include singer/guitarists [[Clyde Moody]], [[Lester Flatt]], Jack Cook, [[Mac Wiseman]], [[Jimmy Martin]], [[Carter Stanley]], [[Del McCoury]], [[Peter Rowan]], [[Roland White]], Roland Dunn and [[Riders in the Sky (band)|Doug Green]]; banjo players [[Earl Scruggs]], Bob Black, [[Butch Robins]], [[Buck Trent]], [[Don Reno]], [[David \"Stringbean\" Akeman|Stringbean]], [[Osborne Brothers|Sonny Osborne]], and [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]]; and fiddlers Tommy Magness, [[Chubby Wise]], [[Vassar Clements]], [[Byron Berline]], [[Kenny Baker (fiddler)|Kenny Baker]], [[Bobby Hicks]], [[Gordon Terry]], [[Randall Franks]] and Glen Duncan. Monroe also regularly performed with flat-picking guitar virtuoso [[Doc Watson]].\n\nModern bluegrass singer and mandolin player [[Ricky Skaggs]] was influenced by Monroe. Skaggs was only six years old, in 1960, when he first got to perform on stage with Monroe and his band at the high school in Martha, Kentucky. He stated, \"I think Bill Monroe's importance to American music is as important as someone like Robert Johnson was to blues, or Louis Armstrong.

I'd hear him sing songs like '[[Man of Constant Sorrow]],' '[[Pretty Polly (ballad)|Pretty Polly]]' and '[[Omie Wise]].'\"<ref name=\"virginia-living55\"/>\n\n{{blockquote|I got my first banjo when I was a teenager.

Drawing heavily on the musical traditions of the area, which included the unique singing style of the [[Primitive Baptist Universalist]] church and the sweet down-home family harmonies of the [[Carter Family]], the two Stanley brothers began playing on local radio stations. They first performed at [[Norton, Virginia]]'s WNVA, but did not stay long there, moving on instead to [[Bristol, Virginia]], and [[WZAP|WCYB]] to start the show ''Farm and Fun Time'', where they stayed \"off and on for 12 years\".<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>\n\nAt first they covered \"a lot of [[Bill Monroe]] music\" (one of the first groups to pick up the new \"bluegrass\" format).<ref name=trischka>Trischka, Tony, \"Ralph Stanley\", ''Banjo Song Book'', Oak Publications, 1977</ref> They soon \"found out that didn't pay off\u2014we needed something of our own. So we started writing songs in 1947, 1948. I guess I wrote 20 or so banjo tunes, but Carter was a better writer than me.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/> When [[Columbia Records]] signed them as The Stanley Brothers, Monroe left in protest joining [[Decca Records]]. Later, Carter went back to sing for the \"Father of Bluegrass\", Monroe.\n\nRalph Stanley gave his opinion on Bill Monroe's apparent change of heart: \"He [Monroe] knew Carter would make him a good singer... Bill Monroe loved our music and loved our singing.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>\n\nThe Stanley Brothers joined [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] in the late '50s, a record company which was so eclectic that it included [[James Brown]] at the time. In fact, James Brown and his band were in the studio when the Stanley Brothers recorded \"[[Finger Poppin' Time]]\". \"James and his band were poppin' their fingers on that\" according to Ralph.<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>  At King Records, they \"went to a more 'Stanley style', the sound that people most know today.\"<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/>\n\nRalph and Carter performed as The Stanley Brothers with their band, The Clinch Mountain Boys, from 1946 to 1966. Ralph kept the band name when he continued as a solo act after Carter's death, from 1967 until his death in 2016.\n\n===Solo===\nAfter Carter died of complications of cirrhosis in 1966, after ailing for \"a year or so\",<ref name=\"virginia-living56\"/> Ralph Stanley faced a hard decision on whether to continue performing on his own. \"I was worried, I didn't know if I could do it by myself. But boy, I got letters, 3,000 of 'em, and phone calls... I went to Syd Nathan at King and asked him if he wanted me to go on, and he said, 'Hell yes!

He is accompanied by reggae greats Tony Chin and Fully Fullwood, on guitar and bass respectively. Crucial Reggae is sometimes accompanied by other musicians to form an either five or six-piece band. They become a nine-piece band when they are joined by the Burning Spear horn section.\n\n'''The Free Mexican Airforce'''\n\nThe Free Mexican Airforce features Rowan and some of his most beloved songs: \"Come Back to Old Santa Fe\", \"Ride the Wild Mustang\", \"Midnight Moonlight\", and \"Free Mexican Airforce\". This four-piece often features Cindy Cashdollar on pedal steel guitar along with players on bass and drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peter-rowan.com/biography.html|title=Peter Rowan Discography|website=www.peter-rowan.com|access-date=2018-06-11}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n{{Further|Peter Rowan discography}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Fiorito, Mike (2023), ''Mescalito Riding His White Horse, Inspired by the Musical Adventures of Peter Rowan'' (O-Books)\n* Goldsmith, Thomas (2004), ''The Bluegrass Reader'', University of Illinois Press\n* Jackson, Blair (), ''Garcia: An American Life'', Penguin\n* Rosenberg, Neil V. \u2013 Wolfe, Charles (1991), Booklet: ''Bill Monroe, Bluegrass 1959\u20131969'', Bear Family BCD 15529\n* Von Schmidt, Eric \u2013 Rooney, Jim (1994), ''Baby, Let Me Follow You Down'', [[University of Massachusetts Press]]\n\n==External links==\n{{cc}}\n* [http://www.peter-rowan.com Official website]\n*{{allmusic}}\n\n{{Old & In the Way}}\n{{New Riders of the Purple Sage}}\n{{International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Rowan, Peter}}\n[[Category:1942 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American Buddhists]]\n[[Category:American folk guitarists]]\n[[Category:American folk singers]]\n[[Category:American male singers]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass guitarists]]\n[[Category:American male guitarists]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass musicians]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Boston]]\n[[Category:Guitarists from Massachusetts]]\n[[Category:20th-century American guitarists]]\n[[Category:20th-century American male musicians]]\n[[Category:Old & In the Way members]]\n[[Category:Earth Opera members]]\n[[Category:Muleskinner (band) members]]\n[[Category:Seatrain (band) members]]\n[[Category:Blue Grass Boys members]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

Together they released their debut studio album, ''[[Act I (Seldom Scene album)|Act I]]'', in 1972, followed by both ''[[Act Two (The Seldom Scene album)|Act II]]'' and ''[[Act III (The Seldom Scene album)|Act III]]'' in 1973.\n\nIn 1977, Starling left the group and was replaced by singer-songwriter Phil Rosenthal. Starling and Rosenthal shared lead vocals on the group's sixth studio album, ''[[Baptizing (album)|Baptizing]]'', released in 1978. Around the same time, the group switched record labels from [[Rebel Records]] to [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill Records]]. In 1986, Rosenthal and Gray left the band, and were replaced by [[Lou Reid]] and [[T. Michael Coleman]], respectively; Reid and Coleman first appeared on the band's 1988 album ''[[A Change of Scenery]]''. Reid left the band in 1992, and Starling briefly returned to the group, performing on their 1994 album ''[[Like We Used to Be]]''. Starling was replaced by [[Moondi Klein]] as the band's lead singer.\n\nDuring 1995 and 1996, Klein, Coleman, and Auldridge, left the Seldom Scene to form a new band called [[Chesapeake (band)|Chesapeake]]. Duffey and Eldridge recruited guitarist Fred Travers, bassist Ronnie Simpkins, and guitarist and singer [[Dudley Connell]] into the Seldom Scene, and together released the album ''[[Dream Scene]]'' in 1996. That same year, Duffey died of a [[heart attack]]. Reid returned to the band to replace Duffey on mandolin, and the group released the album ''[[Scene It All]]'' in 2000. The group's 2007 album ''[[Scenechronized]]'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album]]. The band's original members (Auldridge, Duffey, Eldridge, Gray, and Starling) were inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]] in 2014.\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early career (1971)===\nThe Seldom Scene was established in 1971, and they would practice in Ben Eldridge's basement.<ref name=\"Smithsonian\">{{cite web |last1=Fawcett |first1=Kirstin |title=Seldom Scene, Often Heard: A Bluegrass Band Returns to its Roots With a New Album |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/seldom-scene-often-heard-bluegrass-band-return-roots-new-album-180950161/ |website=Smithsonian |access-date=21 June 2019 |archive-date=21 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621203357/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/seldom-scene-often-heard-bluegrass-band-return-roots-new-album-180950161/ |url-status=live }}</ref> These practice sessions included [[John Starling (musician)|John Starling]] on [[guitar]] and lead vocals, [[Mike Auldridge]] on Dobro and baritone vocals, and former [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] member [[Tom Gray (bluegrass musician)|Tom Gray]] on [[string bass|bass]].

Starling and Rosenthal shared their lead vocals on the group's sixth studio album, ''[[Baptizing (album)|Baptizing]]'' (recorded in 1978). Around the same time, the group switched record labels from [[Rebel Records|Rebel]] to [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hill]]. Starling recorded a solo album for Sugar Hill in 1980 called \"Long Time Gone\" and another in 1982 called \"Waitin' On a Southern Train\", on both of which Mike Auldridge played.\n\nThe lineup of Rosenthal-Duffey-Gray-Auldridge-Eldridge recorded five albums of a comparable popularity to the ones with the founding members, including John Starling. Rosenthal proved to be as good lead singer as Starling and his baritone voice contrasted well with Duffey's high tenor extravaganzas. He also wrote typically two to three songs on each of the albums and also added acoustic guitar solos to the group.<ref>{{Citation |title=Act Four - The Seldom Scene {{!}} Album {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/act-four-mw0000646266 |access-date=2024-07-11 |language=en |archive-date=2023-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231104151257/https://www.allmusic.com/album/act-four-mw0000646266 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===More changes in lineup (1986\u20131996)===\nIn 1986, Phil Rosenthal and Tom Gray both left the band to focus on other pursuits, and were replaced by [[Lou Reid]] and [[T.

Coleman proved to be very controversial, as many purists objected to his use of an electric bass in what is nominally an acoustic genre, but the albums produced by the band after Coleman's arrival maintained the traditional appeal of any of the Scene's earlier albums.\n\nReid left the band in 1992, and Duffey convinced former member John Starling to return to the band for the next year.<ref name=\"allbook\">{{Cite book |last1=Bogdanov |first1=Vladimir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0VRvgAACAAJ |title=All Music Guide to Country: The Definitive Guide to Country Music |last2=Woodstra |first2=Chris |last3=Erlewine |first3=Stephen Thomas |date=2003 |publisher=Backbeat Books |isbn=978-0-87930-760-8 |pages=679 |language=en |access-date=2024-07-11 |archive-date=2024-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240711132848/https://books.google.ca/books/about/All_Music_Guide_to_Country.html?id=H0VRvgAACAAJ&source=kp_book_description&redir_esc=y |url-status=live }}</ref> During that year the Scene recorded the album ''[[Like We Used to Be (album)|Like We Used to Be]]'', but Starling did not wish to stay with the band long term.

His three-finger style of playing was radically different from the traditional way the five-string banjo had previously been played. This new style of playing became popular and elevated the banjo from its previous role as a background rhythm instrument to featured solo status. He popularized the instrument across several genres of music.\n\nScruggs' career began at age 21 when he was hired to play in [[Bill Monroe]]'s band, the Blue Grass Boys. \"Bluegrass\" eventually became the name for an entire genre of country music. Despite considerable success with Monroe, performing on the [[Grand Ole Opry]] and recording classic hits such as \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\", Scruggs resigned from the group in 1948 because of their exhausting touring schedule. Fellow band member [[Lester Flatt]] resigned as well, and he and Scruggs later paired up in the duo [[Flatt and Scruggs]]. Scruggs' banjo instrumental \"[[Foggy Mountain Breakdown]]\" was recorded in December 1949 and released in March 1950. The song became an enduring hit. The song experienced a rebirth of popularity to a younger generation when it was featured in the 1967 film ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]''. The song won two [[Grammy Award]]s and, in 2005, was selected for the Library of Congress' [[National Recording Registry]] of works of unusual merit.\n\nFlatt and Scruggs brought bluegrass music into mainstream popularity in the early 1960s with their country hit \"[[The Ballad of Jed Clampett]]\", the theme music for the television sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''\u2014the first Scruggs recording to reach number one on the [[Billboard charts]]. Over their 20-year association, Flatt and Scruggs recorded over 50 albums and 75 [[Single (music)|singles]]. The duo broke up in 1969, chiefly because, while Scruggs wanted to switch styles to fit a more modern sound, Flatt was a traditionalist who opposed the change and believed doing so would alienate a fan base of bluegrass purists. Although each of them formed a new band to match their visions, neither of them ever regained the success they had achieved as a team.\n \nScruggs received four Grammy awards, a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and a [[List of recipients of the National Medal of Arts|National Medal of Arts]]. He became a member of the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]] and was given a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. In 1985, Flatt and Scruggs were inducted together into the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and named, as a duo, number 24 on [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]]'s \"40 Greatest Men of Country Music\". Scruggs was awarded a [[National Heritage Fellowship]] by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the highest honor in the [[Folk music|folk]] and traditional arts in the United States. Four works by Scruggs have been placed in the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]]. After Scruggs' death in 2012 at age 88, the [[Cleveland County Courthouse (Shelby, North Carolina)|Earl Scruggs Center]] was founded in Shelby, North Carolina, near his birthplace with the aid of a federal grant and corporate donors. The center is a $5.5 million facility that features the musical contributions of Scruggs and serves as an educational center providing classes and field trips for students.\n\n==Early life==\n{{external media | width = 210px | float = right | audio1 = [https://freshairarchive.org/segments/bluegrass-musician-earl-scruggs-1 Bluegrass Musician Earl Scruggs], interviewed by [[Terry Gross]] on ''[[Fresh Air]]'', 34:58, January 9, 2004.<ref name=\"Fresh Air\">{{cite web |title=Bluegrass Musician Earl Scruggs |work=[[Fresh Air]] |publisher=[[WHYY-FM|WHYY]] ([[NPR]]) |date=January 9, 2004 |url=https://freshairarchive.org/segments/bluegrass-musician-earl-scruggs-1 |access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref> }}\n\nEarl Scruggs was born January 6, 1924, in the Flint Hill community of [[Cleveland County, North Carolina|Cleveland County]], North Carolina, a small community just outside of [[Boiling Springs, North Carolina|Boiling Springs]], about 10 miles west of [[Shelby, North Carolina|Shelby]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Reitwiesner |first=William Addams |title=Ancestry of Earl Scruggs |publisher=William Addams Reitwiesner Genealogical Services |url=http://www.wargs.com/other/scruggs.html |access-date=July 14, 2009 |author-link=William Addams Reitwiesner |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109065732/http://www.wargs.com/other/scruggs.html |archive-date=January 9, 2009}}</ref> His father, George Elam Scruggs, was a farmer and a bookkeeper who died of a protracted illness when Earl was four years old.<ref name=\"scruggsbio\">{{cite web |url=http://earlscruggs.com/biography.html |title=Earl Scruggs Biography |publisher=Earlscruggs.com |access-date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> Upon his father's death, Scruggs' mother, Georgia Lula Ruppe (called Lula), was left to take care of the farm and five children, of which Earl was the youngest.<ref name=\"biography-dot-com\">{{cite web |title=Earl Scruggs Biography |url=http://www.biography.com/people/earl-scruggs-20638979#synopsis |website=biography.com |publisher=A&E Television Networks |access-date=February 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222052637/http://www.biography.com/people/earl-scruggs-20638979#synopsis |archive-date=February 22, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe family members all played music.

He was flying his 1974 Cessna Skyhawk II aircraft home to Nashville around midnight from a performance of the Earl Scruggs Revue in Murray, Kentucky. On his landing approach he was enveloped in dense fog and overshot the runway at [[Cornelia Fort Airpark]] in Nashville and the plane flipped over. The automatic crash alert system in the plane did not function, and Scruggs remained without help for five hours. He crawled about 150 feet from the wreckage with a broken ankle, broken nose, and facial lacerations, afraid that the plane might catch fire. His family was driving home from the same concert and was unaware of the crash, but his niece became worried when he did not arrive.

She is the lead vocalist for the country band [[the Chicks]].\n\nIn 1995, after leaving [[Berklee College of Music]], Maines was recruited by the Dixie Chicks to replace their lead singer, Laura Lynch. With Maines as lead vocalist, the band earned 10 [[Country Music Association Awards]] and 13 [[Grammy Award]]s for their work between 1998 and 2007.\n\nIn 2006, with Maines still acting as lead singer, the Dixie Chicks released ''[[Taking the Long Way]]''. The album subsequently won five [[Grammy Awards]] (including [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]). After dropping the \"Dixie\", the Chicks new album ''[[Gaslighter (album)|Gaslighter]]'' was released on July 17, 2020. As a solo artist, Maines released the album, ''[[Mother (Natalie Maines album)|Mother]]'', on May 7, 2013.\n\n== Early life ==\nMaines was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]], to country musician and producer [[Lloyd Maines]] and Tina May Maines. She attended Nat Williams Elementary School in Lubbock, where her second grade teacher recalls being told by Maines during a math lesson, \"Teacher, I don't need to learn this stuff\u2014I'm gonna be a star.\"<ref name=\"Dickerson\" /> Maines was a cheerleader while attending O.

My parents sent me and my sister to public minority schools so I always felt like a hippie and a rebel. ... As a teenager I always loved not thinking in the way I knew the majority of people thought. I always stood up for minorities. ... I've always stood up for homosexuals. I just always had these really strong convictions about doing so.\"<ref name=\"Heysen\">Heysen, Kristen.

Retrieved April 3, 2007.</ref>\n\nFollowing the completion of high school, Maines attended several colleges. She spent two semesters pursuing an undeclared major at [[West Texas A&M University|West Texas A&M]] where her studies focused heavily on radio, then a year and a half at [[South Plains College]]. One of Maines's instructors at South Plains, and a former member of [[The Maines Brothers Band]], Cary Banks, recalled \"She was mostly into [[rock'n'roll]], [[rhythm and blues]] ... [[alternative rock]].\" When Banks encountered Maines on campus, he said that she usually needed to vent a little steam. \"She would get into a lot of political arguments\" at the predominantly Republican school, and was a fan of Texas Governor [[Ann Richards]]. \"She's always been opinionated and hardheaded like her dad.\"<ref name=\"Dickerson\" />  In December 1994, Maines auditioned for and received a full vocal scholarship to Berklee College of Music. She pursued the diploma program at Berklee but dropped out before the completion of her studies. Even though Maines is from Lubbock, home of [[Texas Tech University]], she attended only one class at the school, a 1995 summer course in \"Introductory Wildlife\".<ref name=\"Dickerson\" />\n\n== Career ==\nMaines's first professional recording was lead vocals on the song \"White Women's Clothes\" on Andy Wilkinson's album \"Charlie Goodnight's Life in Poetry and Song.\" Maines's first commercially released work was [[backing vocalist|background vocals]] on [[Pat Green]]'s debut album, ''Dancehall Dreamer'', produced by her father Lloyd Maines and released in 1995. At the end of 1995, at age 21, Maines joined the all-female [[country music]] band, the then named [[Dixie Chicks]], which had been performing since 1989, but which had been unsuccessful in gaining more than local attention. Maines replaced founding lead singer Laura Lynch.  She plays guitar and bass in concert in the band.<ref>{{cite web |last=Davis |first=Rob |url=http://dixiechicksfaq.homestead.com/files/chicks.htm#_28.__What |title=Dixie Chicks FAQ No.&nbsp;30 |access-date=April 12, 2007}}</ref>\n\nMaines co-wrote four tracks for The Chicks' first three albums, including the ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles & Tracks]] chart number one hit \"[[Without You (Dixie Chicks song)|Without You]]\" on ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]''.

Endless and unfulfilling clerical jobs along [[Music Row]] motivated this triple-threat singer, writer, and multi-instrumentalist to start her own [[record label]], Addiebelle Music.<ref name=\"adrienneyoung.com\"/> She also formed the short-lived band Liters of Pop with [[Eric McConnell]].\n\nShe learned to play clawhammer-style banjo from Ketch Secor of [[Old Crow Medicine Show]], and set about amassing a catalog of [[old-time music|old-time]] tunes.  As she says:\n\n{{blockquote|I got really into [[traditional music]] when I was longing to connect with my family again, and that led to trying to build up a repertoire that my grandfather was familiar with, the classic [[old-time music|old-time]] and [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] tunes.<ref>[http://www.courant.com/ \"Adrienne Young's Activism Keeps Her In Tune\"] by Eric R. Danton, Courant Rock Critic, August 17, 2007 [[Hartford Courant]].</ref>}}\n\nYoung began gaining attention with her 2003 win in the Chris Austin songwriting contest at [[MerleFest]] for \"Sadie's Song\".  Co-written with [[Mark D. Sanders]], the song is a re-telling of the murderous bluegrass standard \"[[Little Sadie]]\" told from the victim's point of view.\n\n== Recordings ==\n\"[[Little Sadie]]\" featured prominently on her first [[CD]], ''[[Plow to the End of the Row]]'', produced with another [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]-based musician, [[Will Kimbrough]], and released on her own [[AddieBelle]] [[record label]].  (The label takes its name from a nickname Young was given while working as a tour guide at Nashville's [[Belle Meade Mansion]].)  The [[CD]], which includes a packet of wildflower seeds along with artwork based on the ''[[Farmers' Almanac]]'', was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Album Package.\n\nAn early version of ''Plow to the End of the Row'', released in 2003, has become a sought-after collectible.  That version included several tracks with Young backed by [[Old Crow Medicine Show]] and was a top pick for 2003 Debut Artist by the Freeform American Roots DJ Chart.  The nationally-released version, featuring different sequencing, new tracks, and re-recorded versions of several songs, was released on April 13, 2004, one day before an interview with Young aired on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''.  The [[Americana Music Association]] included Young and her band in their nominees for Emerging Artist of the Year, and the ''[[Nashville Scene]]'' named \"Home Remedy\" as Best Country Single of the year.  The CD went on to place at or near the top of numerous \"best of\" lists for the year and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called Young \"the [[Americana (music)|Americana]] music find of the year.\"\n\n[[Image:Adrienne Young Andy Thacker Little Sadie Little Grill Collective Harrisonburg VA June 2008.jpg|left|thumb|250px|With Andy Thacker of Little Sadie<br>[[Little Grill Collective]], June 27, 2008.]]\nYoung and her band Little Sadie (at the time, Tyler Grant on guitar, Clayton Campbell on fiddle and mandolin, Amanda Kowalski on bass, and Steven Sandifer on percussion) toured extensively across the U.S. and in England.  The members of the band left to pursue other projects prior to the recording of Young's second CD, ''[[The Art of Virtue]]''.\n\nThat disc, released on June 28, 2005, took its theme from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''[[Benjamin Franklin#Thirteen Virtues|Thirteen Virtues]]''.  A copy of Franklin's pamphlet is included with the CD.  Will Kimbrough co-produced the CD and co-wrote several tracks.  Alongside original songs and traditional tunes, the disc featured a cover of the [[Grateful Dead]] song \"Brokedown Palace\".  Young's AddieBelle label struck a distribution deal with [[Ryko Records]] which insured that her music got placed in more record stores.  She also continued to receive support from [[public radio]] and was invited to appear on ''[[World Cafe (radio program)|World Cafe]]'', ''[[Mountain Stage]]'', and ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]''.  With a new incarnation of Little Sadie (fiddler and banjoist Eric Merrill, guitarist Hans Holzen, bassist Kyle Kegerreis, and percussionist Eric Platz), Young toured even more extensively in 2005.\n\n''The Art of Virtue'' placed third in [[Amazon.com]]'s list of the best folk recordings of the year.  Young was invited to sing in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] on January 17, 2006, as part of Benjamin Franklin's 300th birthday celebration.\n\nIn May 2006, Young took her band to [[Levon Helm]]'s studio in [[Woodstock, New York]] to record tracks for a third album, titled ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]],'' which was released May 22, 2007.\n\n== Social and environmental action ==\nYoung's second CD, ''[[The Art of Virtue]]'' released in 2005, took its theme from [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s ''Thirteen Virtues'' and included copy of Franklin's pamphlet inside.  The title track addressed issues that Young found herself pondering after the 2004 re-election of [[George W. Bush]], specifically how the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] had leveraged the theme of [[morality]] as a [[Political campaign|campaign]] tool.  As she said at the time:\n\n{{blockquote|There seems to be a growing passion, collectively and individually, to understand the foundation of our American culture and how we've turned from that. Personally, it steered me back toward a time when our country was rooted in agrarian ideals and words were powerful enough to begin a new world.  Ben Franklin had such a practical approach toward nurturing virtue, the first point being nobody's perfect.}}\n\nSince 2004 Young has been a spokeswoman for the [[FoodRoutes Network]], which aims to aid organizations in rebuilding local, community-based food systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://girlcooksworld.com/|title=Girl Cooks World - Global Cuisine, Cooking Tips, Must-haves & Ideas|website=Girlcooksworld.com|access-date=20 April 2023}}</ref>  Young used the release of the [[CD]] ''[[The Art of Virtue]]'' to call attention to her involvement with the FoodRoutes Network, a non-profit organization that promotes [[sustainable agriculture]] and connects consumers with local farmers who are willing to sell direct.  ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]]'' furthers her involvement in this movement with lyrics and songs directly addressing the issue.\n\n<blockquote>This wasn't the first time she mixed her farm action fever with artistic output: ''Plow to the End of the Row'', her 2004 debut CD, came with a packet of seeds enclosed (and was nominated for the packaging design Grammy).</blockquote>\n\nYoung advocates locally-grown and [[sustainable agriculture]]. A portion of each record sold of ''[[Room to Grow (album)|Room to Grow]]'' goes to the Save A Seed fund, which she created with nonprofit organizations the [[FoodRoutes Network]] and the [[American Community Gardening Association]]. The money will provide non-genetically modified seeds to community gardens across North America.\n\nYoung has toured with help from the organization Buy Fresh Buy Local and each of the 49 FoodRoutes chapters. Along with her performances, each tour stop offered [[sustainable living]] workshops with local sponsors in each community. \"Preserving cultural genetics and agricultural heritage is the key to true security and self-reliance\", she says.\n\nYoung says her music has influenced her activism because she feels at peace in nature and wants to communicate those feelings through her music.\n\nAs of 2010, Adrienne Young has hosted and organized the Backyard Revolution, a group of people sharing and demonstrating unique skills of the past and present to help educate people in self sustainability.  The Backyard Revolution was present at Floyd Fest 9 (2010) and the Heritage Harvest Festival at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello. Demonstrations included: Backyard dairy cow (cow included), hide tanning and bow drill fire-making, home fermentation, historic log cabin construction, arrow fletching, soap making, primitive cooking, edible and medicinal wild plants, and more. See www.backyardrevolution.com for more information.\n\n== Sound and style ==\nHer music, created with various incarnations of her band Little Sadie, blends elements of [[bluegrass music|Bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[old-time music]], and [[American folk music]] with a pop sensibility.\n\n{{blockquote|Young's bluegrass chops come through clearly and there's more than enough high-spirited music to get you up and dancing or clapping along, and more than enough substance to keep you reflecting on the lyrics long after the music's done, too.<ref>[http://www.dirtylinen.com review of ''Room to Grow''] August/September 2007 [[Dirty Linen (magazine)|Dirty Linen]].</ref>|review of \"Room to Grow\"|''[[Dirty Linen (magazine)|Dirty Linen]]''}}\n\n<blockquote>. . tightly crafted songs that, like the feel of her home and the flow of her conversation, infuse her love for American tradition with high contemporary energy.

In his career, he has recorded three studio albums for the [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] label, all three of which contained mostly songs that he wrote himself. He also holds several credits as a session fiddler and mandolinist.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early influences===\nWhen Haynie was nine, he began taking fiddle lessons from his grandmother's cousin, a man named Ted Locke.  He studied the fiddle, for two years, after which he took up the mandolin. He became exceedingly good at both, and within two years he joined a bluegrass band named the Bluegrass Parlor Band. While he was traveling, he got a chance to meet [[Chubby Wise]], a self-styled \"original\" [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]] [[fiddler]], on many occasions. These opportunities enriched his sense of music, and were a great inspiration to him in his younger years.  Another major influence on Haynie's music was that of Kenny Baker, whose fiddle albums were some of his favorites. Those familiar with Baker's fiddle style might recognize similarities in Haynie's sound.\n\nIn 1990, at age 16, attending the [[Florida]] fiddling championships, and competing, Haynie won first place in the contemporary division for the second time, playing Wild Fiddler's Rag and [[Les Patineurs (waltz)|Skater's Waltz]].<ref>{{cite news |first = Jeff |last = Klinkenberg |title = FIT AS A FIDDLE Series: DATELINE FLORIDA |work = St. Petersburg Times |date = 1990-06-03}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1996 Haynie lost two [[violins]] and a [[Violin bow|bow]], when a lightning-induced fire burnt [[Tim Austin (musician)|Tim Austin]]'s [[Doobie Shea Records|Doobie Shea Studios]] to the ground.<ref>{{cite news |first = Mark |last = Morrison |title = Bluegrass Studio up in Flames |work = Roanoke Times & World News |date = 1996-08-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Rosenberg |first=Madelyn |author-link=Madelyn Rosenberg |date=1997-07-30 |title=A Year After a Fire at the Doobie Shea Studios, Tim Austin has the Music Miked and Tapes Humming the Bands Play On... |work=Roanoke Times & World News}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 Haynie won the fiddle category at the 39th Annual [[Academy of Country Music]] Awards.<ref>{{cite news |title = Off-Camera Awards Winners Announced for the 39th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards Live Awards Telecast to Be Broadcast From Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas Wednesday, May 26th at 8:00 PM ET/PT on CBS Television Network |publisher = PR Newswire (U.S.) |date = 2004-05-06}}</ref>\n\nHaynie has been seen appearing in informal music performances under other musicians' headlines, and earned a living as a [[session musician]].\n\n==Discography==\n*''Doin' My Time'' (Sugar Hill, 1997)\n*''A Man Must Carry On'' (Sugar Hill, 2000)\n*''The Bluegrass Fiddle Album'' (Sugar Hill, 2003)\n\n==Awards==\n*[[International Bluegrass Music Association]] Instrumental Album of the Year - 2003 for ''The Bluegrass Fiddle Album'' IBMA Awards - Past Recipients <ref name=\"IBMA Awards - Past Recipients\">[http://www.ibma.org/ibma.awards/recipients/index.asp IBMA Awards - Past Recipients] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223141121/http://www.ibma.org/ibma.awards/recipients/index.asp |date=2009-02-23 }}</ref>\n*[[Academy of Country Music]] Award for fiddle - 2004\n*[[International Bluegrass Music Association]] Recorded Event of the Year - 1996 for ''Bluegrass '95'' (Scott Vestal, Aubrey Haynie, [[Adam Steffey]], Wayne Benson, Barry Bales & Clay Jones) <ref name=\"IBMA Awards - Past Recipients\" />\n*[[International Bluegrass Music Association]] Gospel Recorded Performance of the Year - 1998 - for ''Stanley Gospel Tradition: Songs About Our Savior'' (Tim Austin, Barry Bales, Ronnie Bowman, Aubrey Haynie, James King, Dwight McCall, Dale Perry, Don Rigsby, [[James Alan Shelton]], Junior Sisk, Charlie Sizemore, Craig Smith, Scottie Sparks, Adam Steffey, Ernie Thacker, Dan Tyminski) <ref name=\"IBMA Awards - Past Recipients\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Haynie, Aubrey}}\n[[Category:1974 births]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass fiddlers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American session musicians]]\n[[Category:American country fiddlers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Musicians from Tampa, Florida]]\n[[Category:American bluegrass mandolinists]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Florida]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Florida]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

Clements has been dubbed the Father of Hillbilly Jazz, an improvisational style that blends and borrows from swing, hot jazz, and bluegrass along with roots also in country and other musical traditions.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ledgin |first=Stephanie P. |date=2004 |title=Homegrown Music: Discovering Bluegrass|url=https://archive.org/details/homegrownmusicdi00step |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/homegrownmusicdi00step/page/60 60]|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic |isbn=0275981150}}</ref> He was posthumously inducted into the [[International Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame]] in 2018.\n\n==Biography==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=September 2022}}\nClements was born in [[Kinard, Florida]]<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=83}}</ref> and grew up in [[Kissimmee, Florida|Kissimmee]]. He taught himself to play the fiddle at age 7, learning \"There's an Old Spinning Wheel in the Parlor\" as his first song. Soon, he joined with two first cousins, Red and Gerald, to form a local string band. In his early teens Clements met [[Bill Monroe]] and the [[Blue Grass Boys]] when they came to Florida to visit Clements' stepfather, a friend of fiddler [[Chubby Wise]]. Clements was impressed with his playing.\n\nIn late 1949, Wise left Monroe's group, and the 21 year-old Clements traveled by bus to ask for an audition. When told he would have to return the next day, Clements was crestfallen, lacking the money for either a hotel room or return bus trip. Monroe gave him some money to a night's lodging, and the next day Clements auditioned and was hired. He remained with Monroe for seven years, recording with the band in 1950 and 1951.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nBetween 1957 and 1962, he was a member of the [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] band [[Jim and Jesse]] & the Virginia Boys.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>  He also gained recognition joining with the popular bluegrass duo of [[Flatt and Scruggs]] on the popular theme to the hit television sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]''. [[Earl Scruggs]]' path-breaking banjo style had premiered with Bill Monroe in the late 1940s, and thereafter gained widespread renown with [[Lester Flatt]] and the Foggy Mountain Boys.\n\nBy the mid-1960s, however, his struggles with alcohol left him making his living in [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar trades]], being employed briefly at the [[Kennedy Space Center]] in Florida as a plumber, in a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[paper mill]], and as switchman for [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]].  He even sold insurance and once operated a convenience store while owning a [[potato chip]] [[franchising|franchise]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]]. Sobering up, he returned to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in 1967, where he became a much sought-after studio musician.\n\nAfter a brief touring stint with [[Faron Young]] he joined [[John Hartford]]'s Dobrolic Plectral Society in 1971,<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> when he met guitarist [[Norman Blake (American musician)|Norman Blake]] and [[Dobro]] player [[Tut Taylor]], and recorded ''[[Aereo-Plain]]'', a widely acclaimed \"newgrass\" album that helped broaden the bluegrass market and sound. After less than a year he joined up with Earl Scruggs.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/>\n\nHis 1972 work with the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] on their album ''[[Will the Circle be Unbroken (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band album)|Will the Circle be Unbroken]]'' earned even wider acclaim, and he later worked on the [[Grateful Dead]]'s ''[[Wake of the Flood]]'' and [[Jimmy Buffett]]'s ''[[A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean]]''.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Within the next two years, Clements would cut his first solo album.\n\nIn 1973, he joined and toured with the bluegrass supergroup [[Old & In the Way]] with [[Jerry Garcia]],<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> [[David Grisman]], [[Peter Rowan]], and [[John Kahn]]; their self-titled live album ''[[Old & In the Way (album)|Old & In the Way]]'' was released in 1975.\n[[File:Vassar Clements, Seattle, 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Clements in 1974]]\nIn 1974 he lent his talents to ''[[Highway Call]]'', a solo album by former [[Allman Brothers Band]] guitarist [[Dickey Betts]].\nHe was considered by many to be an outstanding fiddle virtuoso and he described his talent saying, {{blockquote|It was God's gift, something born in me. I was too dumb to learn it any other way. I listened to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] some. I'd pick it up one note at a time. I was young, with plenty of time and I didn't give up. You'd come home from school, do your lessons and that's it. No other distractions. I don't read music. I play what I hear.}}\n\nIn his 50-year career he played with artists ranging from [[Woody Herman]] and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band to the Grateful Dead, [[Linda Ronstadt]], and [[Paul McCartney]], and earned at least five [[Grammy Award]] nominations and numerous professional accolades. He once recorded with the pop group [[the Monkees]] by happenstance, when he stayed behind after an earlier recording session. He also appeared in [[Robert Altman]]'s 1975 film ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]''<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> and [[Alan Rudolph]]'s 1976 film, ''[[Welcome to L.A.]]''. He made a duet album with [[St\u00e9phane Grappelli]] ''Together at Last'' in 1987.\n\nIn 2004, he performed in concert with jazz quartet Third Stream \u2013 in which a video documentary of the concert was done with Jim Easton (guitar), Tom Strohman (sax), Jim Miller (bass), and John Peifer (drums).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vassarclements.com/tourdates_2004.html|title=Vassar Clements - Tour Dates 2004|website=Vassarclements.com|access-date=August 5, 2021}}</ref>\n\nThough he played numerous instruments, Clements indicated that he chose the fiddle over guitar recalling that, \"I picked up a guitar and fiddle and tried them both out. The guitar was pretty easy, but I couldn't get nothing out of the fiddle. So every time I'd see those instruments sitting side by side, I'd grab that fiddle.\"\n\n[[Big band]] and [[swing music]] were considerable influences upon his style and musical development, and he said that, \"Bands like [[Glenn Miller]], [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Harry James]] and [[Artie Shaw]] were very popular when I was a kid. I always loved rhythm, so I guess in the back of my mind the swing and jazz subconsciously comes out when I play, because when I was learning I was always trying to emulate the big-band sounds I heard on my fiddle.\"\n\nVassar Clements played on over 200 albums, including nearly 40 on which he starred or was featured. His albums often featured newgrass style music and what Clements called \"Hillbilly Jazz\". His last album, ''Livin' With the Blues'', released in 2004, was his only blues recording; it featured guest appearances by [[Elvin Bishop]], [[Norton Buffalo]], [[Maria Muldaur]], and others.\n\nHis 2005 [[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance]] was for \"Earl's Breakdown,\" by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and featured Clements, Earl Scruggs, Randy Scruggs, and [[Jerry Douglas (musician)|Jerry Douglas]].\n\nClements, whose last performance was February 4, 2005 in [[Jamestown, New York|Jamestown]], [[New York (state)|New York]], died on August 16, 2005, aged 77, of lung cancer.<ref name=\"Billboard\">{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/61748/bluegrass-great-vassar-clements-dies |title=Bluegrass Great Vassar Clements Dies |date=2005-08-17 |magazine=Billboard |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/news/1507703/legendary-fiddler-vassar-clements-dead-at-age-77/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713205822/http://www.cmt.com/news/1507703/legendary-fiddler-vassar-clements-dead-at-age-77/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 13, 2019 |title=Legendary Fiddler Vassar Clements Dead at Age 77 |last=Gilbert |first=Calvin |date=2005-08-16 |website=CMT News |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/article.php/20050817130351719 |title=World Music Central - Legendary Fiddler Vassar Clements Dies at 77 |date=2005-08-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110110716/http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/article.php/20050817130351719 |archive-date=2005-11-10 |access-date=2019-07-13}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n*''Southern Country Waltzes'' [[Rural Rhythm Records]] (1970)\n*''Vassar'' [[Mercury Records]] (1975)\n*''Superbow'' Mercury Records\n*''Crossing the Catskills'' (1973) Rounder Records\n*''[[Vassar Clements, John Hartford, Dave Holland]]'' (1988) [[Rounder Records]]\n*''Vassar Clements'' MCA Records\n*''The Bluegrass Session'' Flying Records\n*''Grass Routes'' Rounder Records\n*''Saturday Night Shuffle \u2013 A Celebration of Merle Travis'' Shanachie Records\n*''Hillbilly Jazz'' Flying Fish Records\n*''Hillbilly Jazz Rides Again'' (1986) Flying Fish Records   \n*''New Hillbilly Jazz'' Shikata Records\n*''Together at Last'' (Stephane Grappelli & Vassar Clements) Flying Fish Records\n*''Nashville Jam'' Flying Fish Records\n*''Westport Drive Mind'' Dust Records\n*''The Man, The Legend'' Vassillie Productions\n*''Country Classics'' Vassillie Productions\n*''Vassar Clements Reunion with Dixie Gentlemen'' Old Homestead\n*''Once in a While'' (Jam with Miles Davis' ex-band members) Flying Fish Records\n*''Live in Telluride'' (1979) Vassillie Productions\n*''Music City USA'' Vassillie Productions\n*''[[Old & In the Way (album)|Old & In the Way]]'' (1975) Rounder Records\n*''[[That High Lonesome Sound]]'' (1996) Acoustic Disc\n*''[[Breakdown (Old & In the Way album)|Breakdown]]'' (1997) Acoustic Disc\n*''[[Live at the Boarding House]]'' (2008) Acoustic Disc\n*''[[Live at the Boarding House: The Complete Shows]]'' (2013) Acoustic Disc\n*''[[The Bluegrass Sessions: Tales from the Acoustic Planet, Vol. 2]]'' (with [[B\u00e9la Fleck]]) (1999) Warner Bros.

(song)|Charlie and the MTA]]\" in 1963. Two years later, he joined the Down City Ramblers, where he remained through 1971. That year, he made his recording debut on ''15 Bluegrass Instrumentals'' with the band Country Cooking; at the same time, he was also a member of America's premier sports-rock band Country Granola.\n\nIn 1973, he began a three-year stint with Breakfast Special. Between 1974 and 1975, he recorded two solo albums, ''Bluegrass Light'' and ''Heartlands''. Ethnomusicologist Benjamin Krakauer devotes an article to the legacy of this group in the bluegrass community, described as of ''experimental bluegrass musicians from New York City'':<ref name=\"Krakauer\">{{cite journal |last1= Krakauer|first1=Benjamin |date= Summer 2018|title=Music Scene and Its Fringes: Experimental Bluegrass of 1970s New York City |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/americanmusic.36.2.0163 |journal=American Music  |volume= 36|issue=2 |pages=163-193 |doi= 10.5406/americanmusic.36.2.0163|access-date=February 19, 2024}}</ref> {{Blockquote|text=Breakfast Special's innovative music incorporates jazz, avant-garde, psychedelic, klezmer, and various non- Western musical elements into their irreverent and often absurdist performances}}.

Trischka toured with the show in 1978, the year he also played with the [[Monroe Doctrine]].\nIn 1978, Trischka toured Japan and recorded with [[Peter Rowan]] and [[Richard Greene (musician)|Richard Greene]]. In the early 1980s, he began recording with his group Skyline, which released its first album in 1983. Later albums included ''Robot Plane Flies over Arkansas'' (solo, 1983), ''Stranded in the Moonlight'' (with Skyline, 1984) and ''Hill Country'' (solo, 1985). In 1984, he performed in his first feature film, ''[[Foxfire (1987 film)|Foxfire]]''. Three years later, he worked on the pre-recorded music for the off-Broadway production of ''[[Driving Miss Daisy (play)|Driving Miss Daisy]]'' that featured Jessica Tandy and [[Morgan Freeman]]. Trischka produced the Belgian group Gold Rush's ''No More Angels'' in 1988. The following year, Skyline recorded its final album, ''Fire of Grace''. He also recorded the theme song for ''Books on the Air'', a popular [[National Public Radio]] show, and continued his affiliation with the network by appearing on [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Prairie Home Companion]]'', ''[[Mountain Stage]]'', ''From Our Front Porch'', and other radio shows. Trischka continued his recording career with 1993's ''World Turning'', 1995's ''Glory Shone Around: A Christmas Collection'' and 1999's ''Bend''. ''New Deal'' followed in 2003.\n\n''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'', featuring appearances by [[Steve Martin]], [[Earl Scruggs]], [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] and [[Tony Rice]], came out four years later. For this recording Trischka went back to bluegrass and reinvigorated the double banjo tradition. In October 2007, he was given an IBMA (International Bluegrass Music Association) award for Banjo Player of the Year 2007. ''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'' received IBMA awards for Recorded Event of the Year, Instrumental Album of the Year and a Grammy Nomination.\n\nHe has written over fifteen instructional books and a series of DVDs. In July 2009 he launched the groundbreaking ''Online Banjo School with Tony Trischka'', an interactive, online learning school that teaches students around the world how to play banjo with [[ArtistWorks]]. Trischka is closely associated with \"newgrass,\" which features several innovations to traditional bluegrass, including jazzy arrangements, non-traditional chordal structures, and frequent covers of non-bluegrass songs. Trischka is one of the major innovators of the \"chromatic\" banjo style, which features sinewy, snaky melodic runs not strictly played out of chord positions.\n\n2011 saw ''Give Me the Banjo'' aired on PBS stations nationwide with Trischka as the musical director and co-producer of the documentary. It was released on DVD. He produced [[Steve Martin]]'s Grammy-nominated ''Rare Bird Alert'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]]), which features performances by [[Paul McCartney]], the [[Dixie Chicks]] and the [[Steep Canyon Rangers]].\n\nIn December 2012, Trischka was awarded the United States Artists Friends Fellow in recognition of the excellence of his work.<ref>{{Cite web|title=United States Artists \u00bb Tony Trischka|url=https://www.unitedstatesartists.org/fellow/tony-trischka/|access-date=July 11, 2021|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader===\n* ''Bluegrass Light'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1974)\n* ''Heartlands'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1975)\n* ''Banjoland'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1977)\n* ''Fiddle Tunes for Banjo'' with [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]] and [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] (Rounder, 1981)\n* ''A Robot Plane Flies over Arkansas'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1983)\n* ''Hill Country'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1985)\n* ''Alone & Together'' with [[Beppe Gambetta]] ([[Brambus Records|Brambus]], 1991)\n* ''Solo Banjo Works'' with [[B\u00e9la Fleck]] ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1992)\n* ''[[World Turning (Tony Trischka album)|World Turning]]'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1995)\n* ''Glory Shone Around: A Christmas Collection'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 1995)\n* ''Double Banjo Bluegrass Spectacular'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 2007)\n* ''Territory'' ([[Smithsonian Folkways]] 2008)\n* ''Great Big World'' (Rounder, 2014)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rounder.com/2014/02/new-releases/great-big-world |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316005112/http://www.rounder.com/2014/02/new-releases/great-big-world |archive-date=March 16, 2014 |title=Great Big World {{!}} Rounder Records}}</ref>\n*Of A Winter's Night (Independent, 2014)\n*The Durban Sessions (Independent, 2019)\n* ''Shall We Hope'' ([[Shefa Records]], 2021)\n* ''Earl Jam'' (2024)\n\n===With the Big Dogs===\n* ''Live at the Birchmere'' ([[Strictly Country]], 1993)\n\n===With Psychograss===\n* ''Psychograss'' ([[Windham Hill Records|Windham Hill]], 1993)\n* ''Like Minds'' ([[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass label)|Sugar Hil]], 1996)\n* ''Now Hear This'' (Adventure Music America, 2005)\n\n===With [[Skyline (musical group)|Skyline]]===\n* ''Late to Work'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1981)\n* ''Stranded in the Moonlight'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1984)\n* ''Skyline Drive'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1986)\n* ''Fire of Grace'' ([[Flying Fish Records|Flying Fish]], 1989)\n\n===With the Wayfaring Strangers===\n* ''Shifting Sands of Time'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 2001)\n* ''This Train'' ([[Rounder Records|Rounder]], 2003)\n\n==Television appearances==\n* ''Merv Griffin Show'', 1976\n* Nashville Network's ''Fire on the Mountain'', 1984, 1986\n* Ralph Emery's \"Frets\" Awards Show, The Nashville Network, 1987\n* CBS Hallmark Hall of Fame production of ''Foxfire'' with Jessica Tandy, Hume Cronyn and John Denver, 1987\n* British television production of ''Echoes of America: History of the Five String Banjo'', 1989\n* ''Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?''

After recording her first she was convinced it was so bad that she would never do another. Nonetheless, she has continued to make further videos. Many of the first videos she saw were by bluegrass artists. [[Dan Tyminski]] has noted that the [[Michael Jackson's Thriller (music video)|video for ''Thriller'']] was very popular at the time she was first exposed to music videos. She has made suggestions on the style or theme to some videos, though she tends to leave such decisions to the [[music video director|director]] of the particular video. The group chooses directors by seeking out people who have previously directed videos that band members have enjoyed. The director for a video to \"If I Didn't Know Any Better\" from ''Lonely Runs Both Ways'', for example, was selected because Krauss enjoyed work he had done with [[Def Leppard]] and, she wondered, what he could do with their music. While style decisions are generally left to the various directors of the videos, many&nbsp;\u2013 including for \"[[The Lucky One (Alison Krauss song)|The Lucky One]]\", \"Restless\", \"Goodbye is All We Have\", \"New Favorite\", and \"If I Didn't Know Any Better\" \u2013 follow a pattern. In all of these videos Krauss walks, sometimes interacting with other people, while the rest of the band follows her.<ref name=\"gacvideo\" /><ref name=\"gacinterview\">[http://www.gactv.com/gac/shows_ngt/episode/0,,GAC_26155_44020,00.html Interview with Alison Krauss and Dan Tyminski] on ''GAC Nights''{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.
