An indie label, Sister Ruby, expressed interest in the duo, and the two made another album for the label; it emphasized songs that weren't used for ''St. Christophers's Crossing'', which were quieter songs that couldn't be played in loud clubs.  The album was called ''Words Like Numbers''. Bush cited a large improvement between the two albums, because \"with ''St. Christopher's'' we didn't think, we just did it.

He began releasing demos, outtakes, and live performances from Billy Pilgrim on the website [[MP3.com]]. He appreciated that he was able to release music easily without anyone else's approval. Bush partnered with MP3.com to release an old live performance of Billy Pilgrim at Eddie's Attic in 1998, ''Live from Wildhack, MT'', on the website. The performance also contained unreleased songs. Billy Pilgrim released ''Snow Globe'', a Christmas album, in November 1999, and ''9/23/00'', another live performance from Eddie's Attic, released towards the end of the year.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\nAll the money earned from the downloads on MP3.com Bush used to fund the next album and its physical release. The album, ''Billy In the Time Machine'', was recorded in four separate sessions over the course of eight months.

August 07, 2016</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHelm was born in [[Woodstock, New York]], United States, and spent her childhood between Woodstock, Los Angeles, and New York City.  She attended [[Trinity School (New York City)|Trinity High School]]<ref name=\"Deming\" /> where she studied jazz with Dr. [[Aaron Bell (musician)|Aaron Bell]], while singing in bands, playing in New York City clubs and bars.\n\n==Music career==\nIn 1999, Helm joined her father in his blues band The Barn Burners.  They toured the country playing traditional blues music.\n\nIn 2001, she was a co-founding member of alt-country ensemble [[Ollabelle]], which toured and recorded for 10 years, releasing three critically acclaimed albums, ''[[Ollabelle (album)|Ollabelle]]'' (2004), ''[[Riverside Battle Songs]]'' (2006), and ''Neon Blue Bird'' (2011).\n\nIn 2004, she and her father built the Midnight Ramble concerts at his home in Woodstock, New York. The concerts began as a [[rent party]] and grew into a Woodstock institution, featuring artists such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Allen Toussaint]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Phil Lesh]], and many others.\n\nGrowing out of the Midnight Rambles, [[Levon Helm]] recorded his first album in 25 years, ''[[Dirt Farmer]]'', which was produced by Amy and [[Larry Campbell]]. ''Dirt Farmer'' went on to win the [[Grammy award for Best Traditional Folk Album]] in February 2008. In 2009, they recorded ''[[Electric Dirt]]'', which won the first-ever [[Grammy award for Best Americana Album]] in 2010.  She also was a part of the live album ''[[Ramble at the Ryman]]'', recorded in 2008 at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville. This album won the 2012 Grammy award for Best Americana Album.\n\nHelm has extensive credits as a background vocalist and whistler on records by artists such as [[Steely Dan]], [[Mercury Rev]], [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]], [[William Bell (singer)|William Bell]], [[Rich Robinson]], and [[Rosanne Cash]].\n\nIn 2015, she released her first solo album, ''Didn't It Rain'' which featured her father's last recorded drum performances. The album also featured members of the Midnight Ramble Band and Amy's touring band, as well as other players and singers such as [[John Medeski]], [[Bill Payne]], and [[Catherine Russell (singer)|Catherine Russell]].\n\nIn 2017, Helm recorded her second album with producer [[Joe Henry]] in Los Angeles. The album features musicians [[Doyle Bramhall II]], Tyler Chester, [[Jen Condos]], and [[Jay Bellerose]], as well as a background vocal section consisting of [[Allison Russell]], JT Nero, and Adam Minkoff. The album, entitled ''This Too Shall Light'', was released on September 21, 2018 on [[Yep Roc Records]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://amyhelm.bandcamp.com/album/this-too-shall-light | title=This Too Shall Light \u2014 Amy Helm | publisher=[[Bandcamp]] | date=September 21, 2018 | accessdate=July 22, 2019}}</ref> The album's title track premiered on [[Rolling Stone Country]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/country/news/hear-amy-helms-new-song-this-too-shall-light-w521847|title=Hear Amy Helm's Cathartic, Harmony Rich 'This Too Shall Light'|first=David|last=Menconi|date=22 June 2018|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=22 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nHelm resides in [[Woodstock, New York]].

Though each member was aware of one another, it was only Todd, Tim, and Andy who had played together. Tim, had joined Todd's band From Good Homes on stage, in addition Tim and Andy having a 20-year friendship through their former bands, The Blue Sparks From Hell, and [[New Jersey]] rock outfit [[Kings in Disguise]]. When rehearsals of original music, mostly written by Sheaffer, began occurring, the band soon realized that something musically unique was happening. After three weeks of rehearsing, they went into a local recording studio to track a five-song demo. Recorded live with no overdubs except backing vocals, this untitled demo set Railroad Earth's career in motion.  Within a week, they landed a slot at [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]], an appearance that was only the new band's tenth as Railroad Earth. The previous nine gigs had been little more than warm-ups at small North Jersey bars and Elks lodges and a couple of support slots for regional bands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |title=Railroad Earth &#124; Pollstar - the Concert Hotwire |access-date=2009-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810131640/http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |archive-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Realizing immediately how strong the initial five-song demo was, the band decided to return to the same studio to cut another five tracks to complete an album for release in time to debut at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]]. In early April 2001, the band tracked another five songs, and ''[[The Black Bear Sessions]]'' was completed. It was released to the public in June 2001, just one week before their appearance at Telluride. That album contains what are still some of the most popular songs in Railroad Earth's repertoire, including \"Seven Story Mountain,\" \"Head\" and, of course, \"Railroad Earth.\"\n\nThe band was approached by [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] after seeing their performance at Telluride. Right after their show, Railroad Earth was offered a record deal on the spot.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn June 2002, Railroad Earth released its follow-up album on Sugar Hill titled ''[[Bird in a House]]'', featuring such enduring songs as \"Like A Buddha,\" \"Mighty River,\" and the album's title track. Throughout that year Railroad Earth's touring schedule increased dramatically and their growing fanbase began to emerge as something tangible to promoters, radio stations and other media. They were garnering raves for their unique sound and exciting live shows and had become a staple act on the line-up of any roots, folk or [[jam-band]] festival. Their fans, who were now calling themselves \"Hobos,\" began to grow quickly in number, and the venues were getting larger along with them.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn late March 2003, Dave Von Dollen was replaced by Atlanta-based bassist Johnny Grubb. The following year, the band released its third studio effort, ''[[The Good Life (Railroad Earth album)|The Good Life]]'', featuring \"Storms\", \"Mourning Flies\" and \"Goat\".  The band continued to tour throughout the country, and its first live album, ''[[Elko (album)|Elko]]'', was issued in late January 2006. They performed at the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] on September 15, 2007.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://livemusicblog.com/news/2007-austin-city-limits-music-festival-lineup/|title = 2007 Austin City Limits Music Festival Lineup - LIVE music blog|newspaper = Live Music Blog|date = 10 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe band's fourth studio album, titled ''Amen Corner'', was released on June 10, 2008.

The group, widely known for the song \"[[For What It's Worth]]\",<ref name=\"AM\" /> released three albums and several singles from 1966 to 1968. Their music combined elements of [[folk music]] and [[country music]] with influences from the [[British Invasion]] and [[psychedelic rock]]. Like contemporary band [[the Byrds]], they were key to the early development of [[folk rock]]. The band took their name from a [[steamroller]] parked outside their house.\n\nBuffalo Springfield formed in Los Angeles in 1966 with Stills (guitar, keyboards, vocals), Martin (drums, vocals), Palmer (bass guitar), Furay (guitar, vocals) and Young (guitar, harmonica, piano, vocals).<ref>{{cite book|author=Tony Russell|title=Encyclopedia of Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZjoO9_YhfwC|year=1983|publisher=Crescent Books|isbn=978-0-517-40865-0|page=161}}</ref> The band signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1966 and released their debut single \"[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]\", which became a hit in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"RRHF\">{{cite web|title=Buffalo Springfield|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/buffalo-springfield/bio/|publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=February 18, 2016|archive-date=August 29, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829121654/https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/buffalo-springfield/bio|url-status=live}}</ref> The following January, they released the [[protest song]] \"For What It's Worth\", which became their only US top 10 hit and a [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] anthem.<ref name=\"AM\" /> Their second album, ''[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]'', marked their progression to psychedelia and [[hard rock]]<ref name=\"AM\">{{AllMusic | class=artist|id=mn0000939567| tab=biography| label=Artist Biography| first=Richie| last=Unterberger| access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref> and featured songs such as \"[[Bluebird (Buffalo Springfield song)|Bluebird]]\" and \"[[Mr. Soul]]\".\n\nAfter several drug-related arrests and line-up changes, the group disbanded in 1968.

Stephen Stills went on to form the supergroup [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]] with [[David Crosby]] of the Byrds and [[Graham Nash]] of [[the Hollies]].

Young was there with [[the Squires]], a [[Winnipeg]] group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with [[The Company (folk-rock band)|the Company]], a spin-off from the [[Cafe Au Go Go|Au Go Go Singers]]. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where he worked as a [[session musician]] and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, [[the Monkees]].<ref name=\"Prown Newquist 1997\">{{cite book|author= Pete Prown, HP Newquist|date= 1997|title= Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|page= 45|publisher= Hal Leonard| isbn= 978-0-7935-4042-6}}</ref> Told by record producer [[Barry Friedman]] there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former [[The Squires|Squires]] bass player [[Ken Koblun]] to come join him in [[California]]. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group [[3's a Crowd (band)|3's a Crowd]].\n\nWhile in Toronto in early 1966, Young met [[Bruce Palmer]], a Canadian who was playing bass for [[the Mynah Birds]]. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for [[Motown Records]] when their singer Ricky James Matthews\u2014James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as [[Rick James]]\u2014was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being [[Desertion|AWOL]].\n\nWith their record deal cancelled, Young and Palmer pawned the Mynah Birds' musical equipment and bought a 1953 [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] [[hearse]], which they drove to [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"WFP\">{{cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/one-moment-that-made-music-history-375979631.html|title=One moment that made music history|author=John Einarson|newspaper=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]|date=April 16, 2017|access-date=November 26, 2018|archive-date=November 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181127110629/https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/one-moment-that-made-music-history-375979631.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Young and Palmer arrived in L.A. hoping to meet [[Stephen Stills]], who, as Young had learned, was living in the city. However, after almost a week of searching clubs and coffeehouses, the pair had been unable to find Stills. Consequently, on April 6, 1966, Young and Palmer decided to leave Los Angeles and drive north to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. While the two were stuck in traffic on [[Sunset Boulevard]], they were spotted by Stills and [[Richie Furay]], who were heading the other direction down Sunset. Stills and Furay managed to switch lanes and maneuver behind Young's hearse, at which point the musicians pulled off the road and reunited.<ref name=\"WFP\" />\n\nDrummer [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]], who had played with [[garage rock]] group [[the Standells]] and with [[country music|country]] artists such as [[Patsy Cline]] and [[the Dillards]], joined at the suggestion of [[the Byrds]]' manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of [[steamroller]] made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on 11 April 1966, at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in [[West Hollywood]], five days after the chance encounter on Sunset Boulevard. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for [[the Dillards]] and [[the Byrds]].\n\n=== Management and first recordings ===\n[[Chris Hillman]] of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from [[Sonny & Cher]]'s management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with [[Ahmet Ertegun]] of [[Atlantic Records]] for a four-album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with [[Elektra Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]], and arranged for the band to start recording at [[Gold Star Studios]] in Hollywood.\n[[File:City of Portland OR Archives.jpg|thumb|Buffalo Springfield Steamroller]]\nThe first Buffalo Springfield single, \"[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own [[Monaural|mono]] mix was superior to the [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's [[Buffalo Springfield (album)|eponymous album]] was released by Atlantic subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] in mono and in stereo in October 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6igEAAAAMBAJ&q=buffalo+springfield&pg=PP1|title=Billboard|date=October 22, 1966}}</ref> A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.\n\n[[File:Buffalo Springfield Promotional Photo.png|thumb|The band in late 1966]]\n\nIn November 1966, Stills composed \"[[For What It's Worth]]\", responding to a protest that had turned violent following the closing of the [[Pandora's Box (nightclub)|Pandora's Box]] nightclub on [[Sunset Strip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-aug-05-me-then5-story.html|title=Closing of club ignited the 'Sunset Strip riots'|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|date=August 5, 2007|access-date=June 3, 2017|archive-date=January 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130193147/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/local/me-then5|url-status=live}}</ref> The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] soon afterwards.

Recording sessions were booked, and all the songs that appeared on the final album were recorded by the end of March, usually with Messina producing.\n\nIn the [[Netflix]] documentary ''Echo in the Canyon'', Stills related an incident that illustrated the band's problems with law enforcement. The band were hosting a small rehearsal party, attended by [[Eric Clapton]] among others, in April 1968.<ref name=\"break\" /> Despite reportedly playing at a comfortable sound level, a police officer arrived after a disturbing the peace complaint. During the encounter, the officer smelled marijuana and Stills ran next door to \"call lawyers,\" but in actuality went next door and escaped out the bathroom window. According to Stills, Young was going to chase the police down the street, to which Stills said \"cause he's Canadian and I guess in Canada you can do that\". Ultimately, Young, Furay and Messina were arrested and sent to the [[LA County Jail|Los Angeles County Jail]].\n\nFollowing a gig at the Long Beach Auditorium on 5 May 1968, the band held a meeting with Ertegun to arrange their breakup. Stills and Furay stayed with Atlantic, while Young moved to Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"break\" /> Later, Furay and Messina compiled various tracks recorded between mid-1967 and early 1968 into the third and final studio album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'' (1968).\n\n== New Buffalo Springfield and reunion attempts ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\n\nMartin formed a new version of Buffalo Springfield in September 1968. Dubbed New Buffalo Springfield, the lineup consisted of guitarists Dave Price ([[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]]'s stand-in with [[the Monkees]]), Gary Rowles (son of jazz pianist [[Jimmy Rowles]]) who later joined Arthur Lee's [[Love (band)|Love]], bass player Bob Apperson, drummer Don Poncher (also later a member of Love), and horn player [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]], who later became a top session musician for [[Delaney Bramlett]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Joe Cocker]] and others.\n\nThe new band toured extensively and appeared at the highly publicized Holiday Rock Festival in San Francisco on 25\u201326 December 1968, but soon ran afoul of Stills and Young, who took legal action to prevent Martin from using the band's name. Following an agreement to give up future royalties from Buffalo Springfield's recordings, Martin was allowed to use the name ''New Buffalo''. He attempted to retrieve his rights in 1974 and though the matter was settled out of court, he felt that he had been mistreated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|title=Dewey Martin: Drummer with Buffalo Springfield|date=February 7, 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812233308/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1969, Martin and Dave Price formed a second version of New Buffalo with guitarist Bob \"BJ\" Jones and bass player [[Randy Fuller (musician)|Randy Fuller]], brother of the late [[Bobby Fuller]]. The band made some recordings with producer [[Tom Dowd]] overseeing, but they were scrapped. Another guitarist, Joey Newman (formerly of Don and the Goodtimes, later of the pioneering prog group Touch), was added in June 1969, but two months later Martin was fired, and the remaining members carried on as [[Blue Mountain Eagle (band)|Blue Mountain Eagle]]. Martin then formed a new group called Medicine Ball, which released a lone album in 1970 for [[Uni Records]]. Martin also released two solo singles, one for Uni and one for RCA, which did not appear on the album. During the 1970s, he retired from the music industry and became a car mechanic.\n\nIn 1984, Bruce Palmer teamed up with Frank Wilks (vocals, guitar), [[Stan Endersby]] (guitar) and Alan Prosser (drums) to form the Springfield Band, which became Buffalo Springfield Revisited in 1985 when Dewey Martin was brought up to [[Toronto]] to join, and off they went on tour for the next three to four years under this band name (though Martin dropped out by 1987). Neil Young and Stephen Stills gave Buffalo Springfield Revisited permission to tour with that name.\n\nIn July 1986, Palmer, Martin, Furay, Young and Stills gathered at Stills' house, with Buffalo Springfield Revisited keyboardist Harlan Spector, to rehearse for an apparent reunion tour. One of the 1986 rehearsals was video recorded. It was the last time all five original members performed together. Plans for a subsequent reunion tour were abandoned.\n\nBy 1990, Bruce Palmer and Frank Wilks had moved to [[Topanga, California]], where Dennis Knicely joined to perform percussion. The following year they started White Buffalo along with Dewey Martin and others, then Martin formed the short lived Buffalo Springfield Again in 1991 with Billy Darnell (guitar), Robin Lambe (bass) and [[Michael Curtis (musician)|Michael Curtis]] (vocals, guitar). But Furay issued a [[cease and desist]] order on Martin in 1992, and Martin retired from music again the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|title=Buffalo Springfield Rides Again, Along With Others|date=September 12, 1991|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812233311/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== 2010\u201311 reunion ==\nOn his album ''[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]'' (2000), Young sang of his desire to re-form the group and to \"see those guys again and give it a shot\" in \"Buffalo Springfield Again\".

In 1990, Bush played guitar and sang backup vocals on ''Big Back Porch Songs'', an album by the Hyras. ''Big Back Porch Songs'' was never released but Bush was given a copy.

The Hyras had made plans for future performances, but Annie had accepted a job in [[Miami, Florida]]; Bush replaced her.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\nAfter a year of performing, the two drove to Knoxville where they rented two days of studio time, where they recorded 14 original songs, assisted by their producer Danny Browns. The two released their first album together in 1991, ''St. Christopher's Crossing'', independently under the credit Andrew Hyra and Kristian Bush.<ref name=\"AMBP\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-pilgrim-mn0000770092 |title=Billy Pilgrim - Biography |access-date=October 25, 2023 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> They continued performing shows in southeastern college towns, and Bush reached out to various talent agents with their demos; Jen Stark, an intern at [[Atlantic Records]], recceived a copy, which resulted in commotion about them amongst the company. An indie label, Sister Ruby, expressed interest in the duo, and the two made another album for the label; it emphasized songs that weren't used for ''St. Christophers's Crossing'', which were quieter songs that couldn't be played in loud clubs.  The album was called ''Words Like Numbers''. Bush cited a large improvement between the two albums, because \"with ''St. Christopher's'' we didn't think, we just did it.  This time we had several weeks to think about what we were recording.\"<ref name=\"BP\"/> The album was a success in garnering attention; Atlantic Records held a release party for the two, and they were signed to the label that night,<ref name=\"BP\"/> in New York.<ref name=\"TED\"/> The duo name was officially changed to [[Billy Pilgrim (duo)|Billy Pilgrim]], named after a character from [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Billy Pilgrim Review |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268642485.pdf |last=Cook |first=Sean |date=February 17, 1994 |pages=2 |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]}}</ref><ref name=\"BP\"/><ref name=\"TOCBP\"/>\n\nThe duo released the self-titled album ''Billy Pilgrim'' in 1994, in association with producer [[Hugh Padgham]], who had a group of London musicians overdub the master with additional instruments.<ref name=\"BP\"/><ref name=\"TOCBP\">{{Cite web |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/kristian-bush-pre-sugarland-band-billy-pilgrim-lost-album-time-machine/ |title=Kristian Bush's Pre-Sugarland Album Band Billy Pilgrim Releasing Their Long Lost Album [Listen] |date=July 16, 2020 |access-date=October 25, 2023 |website=[[Taste Of Country]] |last=Trapp |first=Phillip}}</ref> Although the album itself received little attention, \"Get Me Out Of Here\" and \"Insomniac\", two songs on the album were, receiving heavy airplay on AAA radio. In 1995 they opened on a worldwide tour for [[Melissa Etheridge]], but copies for ''Billy Pilgrim'' weren't made in time to be promoted throughout it.<ref name=\"BP\"/> To increase their momentum, Atlantic Records made the two record another album in December 1994; unprepared, they scrambled to write new material two weeks ahead of the date of recording. They were paired with a group of veteran musicians who emphasized sounds that took away from their original music.<ref name=\"BP\"/> Their second album, ''[[Bloom (Billy Pilgrim album)|Bloom]]'', released in 1995. The lead single \"Sweet Louisiana Sound\" was a critical and commercial success, making a full rotation on [[VH1]].

Hyra moved to California but still kept in contact with Bush. Billy Pilgrim went silent temporarily as did Bush; he occasionally played at [[Eddie's Attic]], and did production work [[Ellis Paul]], Beth Wood, and [[Evan and Jaron]]. Bush announced the two were making separate solo albums in 1997, but such albums never released. Bush and Hyra collaborated for a \"farewell\" tour, and although they simply meant they were taking a hiatus, news spread they were disbanding.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\n==== 1999\u20132001: Billy Pilgrim hiatus ====\nIn 1999, Bush took interest in the newly developing format of online music distribution. He began releasing demos, outtakes, and live performances from Billy Pilgrim on the website [[MP3.com]]. He appreciated that he was able to release music easily without anyone else's approval. Bush partnered with MP3.com to release an old live performance of Billy Pilgrim at Eddie's Attic in 1998, ''Live from Wildhack, MT'', on the website. The performance also contained unreleased songs. Billy Pilgrim released ''Snow Globe'', a Christmas album, in November 1999, and ''9/23/00'', another live performance from Eddie's Attic, released towards the end of the year.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\nAll the money earned from the downloads on MP3.com Bush used to fund the next album and its physical release. The album, ''Billy In the Time Machine'', was recorded in four separate sessions over the course of eight months. Bush cited [[U2]]{{'}}s ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and [[Thom Yorke]] as inspiration for the album. It was released May 12, 2001.<ref name=\"BP\"/> The final works the two made together before unofficially disbanding were compiled into masters tapes. The tapes, as well as their studio, burned in a fire in late 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://magnetmagazine.com/2021/03/24/magnet-television-qa-with-kristian-bush-and-andrew-hyra-billy-pilgrim/ |title=Magnet Television: Q&A With Kristian Bush and Andrew Hyra (Billy Pilgrim) |date=March 24, 2021 |access-date=November 19, 2023 |website=[[Magnet Magazine]]}}</ref><ref name=\"BP\"/> One copy was salvaged from the accident and made into a CD, of which 500 copies were made and distributed at their final performance in 2001 at [[Eddie's Attic]].

She attended [[Trinity School (New York City)|Trinity High School]]<ref name=\"Deming\" /> where she studied jazz with Dr. [[Aaron Bell (musician)|Aaron Bell]], while singing in bands, playing in New York City clubs and bars.\n\n==Music career==\nIn 1999, Helm joined her father in his blues band The Barn Burners.  They toured the country playing traditional blues music.\n\nIn 2001, she was a co-founding member of alt-country ensemble [[Ollabelle]], which toured and recorded for 10 years, releasing three critically acclaimed albums, ''[[Ollabelle (album)|Ollabelle]]'' (2004), ''[[Riverside Battle Songs]]'' (2006), and ''Neon Blue Bird'' (2011).\n\nIn 2004, she and her father built the Midnight Ramble concerts at his home in Woodstock, New York. The concerts began as a [[rent party]] and grew into a Woodstock institution, featuring artists such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Allen Toussaint]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Phil Lesh]], and many others.\n\nGrowing out of the Midnight Rambles, [[Levon Helm]] recorded his first album in 25 years, ''[[Dirt Farmer]]'', which was produced by Amy and [[Larry Campbell]]. ''Dirt Farmer'' went on to win the [[Grammy award for Best Traditional Folk Album]] in February 2008. In 2009, they recorded ''[[Electric Dirt]]'', which won the first-ever [[Grammy award for Best Americana Album]] in 2010.  She also was a part of the live album ''[[Ramble at the Ryman]]'', recorded in 2008 at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville. This album won the 2012 Grammy award for Best Americana Album.\n\nHelm has extensive credits as a background vocalist and whistler on records by artists such as [[Steely Dan]], [[Mercury Rev]], [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]], [[William Bell (singer)|William Bell]], [[Rich Robinson]], and [[Rosanne Cash]].\n\nIn 2015, she released her first solo album, ''Didn't It Rain'' which featured her father's last recorded drum performances. The album also featured members of the Midnight Ramble Band and Amy's touring band, as well as other players and singers such as [[John Medeski]], [[Bill Payne]], and [[Catherine Russell (singer)|Catherine Russell]].\n\nIn 2017, Helm recorded her second album with producer [[Joe Henry]] in Los Angeles. The album features musicians [[Doyle Bramhall II]], Tyler Chester, [[Jen Condos]], and [[Jay Bellerose]], as well as a background vocal section consisting of [[Allison Russell]], JT Nero, and Adam Minkoff.

Though each member was aware of one another, it was only Todd, Tim, and Andy who had played together. Tim, had joined Todd's band From Good Homes on stage, in addition Tim and Andy having a 20-year friendship through their former bands, The Blue Sparks From Hell, and [[New Jersey]] rock outfit [[Kings in Disguise]]. When rehearsals of original music, mostly written by Sheaffer, began occurring, the band soon realized that something musically unique was happening. After three weeks of rehearsing, they went into a local recording studio to track a five-song demo. Recorded live with no overdubs except backing vocals, this untitled demo set Railroad Earth's career in motion.  Within a week, they landed a slot at [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]], an appearance that was only the new band's tenth as Railroad Earth. The previous nine gigs had been little more than warm-ups at small North Jersey bars and Elks lodges and a couple of support slots for regional bands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |title=Railroad Earth &#124; Pollstar - the Concert Hotwire |access-date=2009-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810131640/http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |archive-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Realizing immediately how strong the initial five-song demo was, the band decided to return to the same studio to cut another five tracks to complete an album for release in time to debut at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]]. In early April 2001, the band tracked another five songs, and ''[[The Black Bear Sessions]]'' was completed. It was released to the public in June 2001, just one week before their appearance at Telluride. That album contains what are still some of the most popular songs in Railroad Earth's repertoire, including \"Seven Story Mountain,\" \"Head\" and, of course, \"Railroad Earth.\"\n\nThe band was approached by [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] after seeing their performance at Telluride. Right after their show, Railroad Earth was offered a record deal on the spot.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn June 2002, Railroad Earth released its follow-up album on Sugar Hill titled ''[[Bird in a House]]'', featuring such enduring songs as \"Like A Buddha,\" \"Mighty River,\" and the album's title track. Throughout that year Railroad Earth's touring schedule increased dramatically and their growing fanbase began to emerge as something tangible to promoters, radio stations and other media. They were garnering raves for their unique sound and exciting live shows and had become a staple act on the line-up of any roots, folk or [[jam-band]] festival. Their fans, who were now calling themselves \"Hobos,\" began to grow quickly in number, and the venues were getting larger along with them.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn late March 2003, Dave Von Dollen was replaced by Atlanta-based bassist Johnny Grubb. The following year, the band released its third studio effort, ''[[The Good Life (Railroad Earth album)|The Good Life]]'', featuring \"Storms\", \"Mourning Flies\" and \"Goat\".  The band continued to tour throughout the country, and its first live album, ''[[Elko (album)|Elko]]'', was issued in late January 2006.

Consequently, on April 6, 1966, Young and Palmer decided to leave Los Angeles and drive north to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. While the two were stuck in traffic on [[Sunset Boulevard]], they were spotted by Stills and [[Richie Furay]], who were heading the other direction down Sunset. Stills and Furay managed to switch lanes and maneuver behind Young's hearse, at which point the musicians pulled off the road and reunited.<ref name=\"WFP\" />\n\nDrummer [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]], who had played with [[garage rock]] group [[the Standells]] and with [[country music|country]] artists such as [[Patsy Cline]] and [[the Dillards]], joined at the suggestion of [[the Byrds]]' manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of [[steamroller]] made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on 11 April 1966, at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in [[West Hollywood]], five days after the chance encounter on Sunset Boulevard. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for [[the Dillards]] and [[the Byrds]].\n\n=== Management and first recordings ===\n[[Chris Hillman]] of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from [[Sonny & Cher]]'s management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with [[Ahmet Ertegun]] of [[Atlantic Records]] for a four-album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with [[Elektra Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]], and arranged for the band to start recording at [[Gold Star Studios]] in Hollywood.\n[[File:City of Portland OR Archives.jpg|thumb|Buffalo Springfield Steamroller]]\nThe first Buffalo Springfield single, \"[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own [[Monaural|mono]] mix was superior to the [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's [[Buffalo Springfield (album)|eponymous album]] was released by Atlantic subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] in mono and in stereo in October 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6igEAAAAMBAJ&q=buffalo+springfield&pg=PP1|title=Billboard|date=October 22, 1966}}</ref> A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.\n\n[[File:Buffalo Springfield Promotional Photo.png|thumb|The band in late 1966]]\n\nIn November 1966, Stills composed \"[[For What It's Worth]]\", responding to a protest that had turned violent following the closing of the [[Pandora's Box (nightclub)|Pandora's Box]] nightclub on [[Sunset Strip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-aug-05-me-then5-story.html|title=Closing of club ignited the 'Sunset Strip riots'|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|date=August 5, 2007|access-date=June 3, 2017|archive-date=January 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130193147/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/local/me-then5|url-status=live}}</ref> The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] soon afterwards.

Recording sessions were booked, and all the songs that appeared on the final album were recorded by the end of March, usually with Messina producing.\n\nIn the [[Netflix]] documentary ''Echo in the Canyon'', Stills related an incident that illustrated the band's problems with law enforcement. The band were hosting a small rehearsal party, attended by [[Eric Clapton]] among others, in April 1968.<ref name=\"break\" /> Despite reportedly playing at a comfortable sound level, a police officer arrived after a disturbing the peace complaint. During the encounter, the officer smelled marijuana and Stills ran next door to \"call lawyers,\" but in actuality went next door and escaped out the bathroom window. According to Stills, Young was going to chase the police down the street, to which Stills said \"cause he's Canadian and I guess in Canada you can do that\". Ultimately, Young, Furay and Messina were arrested and sent to the [[LA County Jail|Los Angeles County Jail]].\n\nFollowing a gig at the Long Beach Auditorium on 5 May 1968, the band held a meeting with Ertegun to arrange their breakup. Stills and Furay stayed with Atlantic, while Young moved to Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"break\" /> Later, Furay and Messina compiled various tracks recorded between mid-1967 and early 1968 into the third and final studio album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'' (1968).\n\n== New Buffalo Springfield and reunion attempts ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\n\nMartin formed a new version of Buffalo Springfield in September 1968. Dubbed New Buffalo Springfield, the lineup consisted of guitarists Dave Price ([[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]]'s stand-in with [[the Monkees]]), Gary Rowles (son of jazz pianist [[Jimmy Rowles]]) who later joined Arthur Lee's [[Love (band)|Love]], bass player Bob Apperson, drummer Don Poncher (also later a member of Love), and horn player [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]], who later became a top session musician for [[Delaney Bramlett]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Joe Cocker]] and others.\n\nThe new band toured extensively and appeared at the highly publicized Holiday Rock Festival in San Francisco on 25\u201326 December 1968, but soon ran afoul of Stills and Young, who took legal action to prevent Martin from using the band's name. Following an agreement to give up future royalties from Buffalo Springfield's recordings, Martin was allowed to use the name ''New Buffalo''. He attempted to retrieve his rights in 1974 and though the matter was settled out of court, he felt that he had been mistreated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|title=Dewey Martin: Drummer with Buffalo Springfield|date=February 7, 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812233308/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1969, Martin and Dave Price formed a second version of New Buffalo with guitarist Bob \"BJ\" Jones and bass player [[Randy Fuller (musician)|Randy Fuller]], brother of the late [[Bobby Fuller]]. The band made some recordings with producer [[Tom Dowd]] overseeing, but they were scrapped. Another guitarist, Joey Newman (formerly of Don and the Goodtimes, later of the pioneering prog group Touch), was added in June 1969, but two months later Martin was fired, and the remaining members carried on as [[Blue Mountain Eagle (band)|Blue Mountain Eagle]]. Martin then formed a new group called Medicine Ball, which released a lone album in 1970 for [[Uni Records]]. Martin also released two solo singles, one for Uni and one for RCA, which did not appear on the album. During the 1970s, he retired from the music industry and became a car mechanic.\n\nIn 1984, Bruce Palmer teamed up with Frank Wilks (vocals, guitar), [[Stan Endersby]] (guitar) and Alan Prosser (drums) to form the Springfield Band, which became Buffalo Springfield Revisited in 1985 when Dewey Martin was brought up to [[Toronto]] to join, and off they went on tour for the next three to four years under this band name (though Martin dropped out by 1987). Neil Young and Stephen Stills gave Buffalo Springfield Revisited permission to tour with that name.\n\nIn July 1986, Palmer, Martin, Furay, Young and Stills gathered at Stills' house, with Buffalo Springfield Revisited keyboardist Harlan Spector, to rehearse for an apparent reunion tour. One of the 1986 rehearsals was video recorded. It was the last time all five original members performed together. Plans for a subsequent reunion tour were abandoned.\n\nBy 1990, Bruce Palmer and Frank Wilks had moved to [[Topanga, California]], where Dennis Knicely joined to perform percussion. The following year they started White Buffalo along with Dewey Martin and others, then Martin formed the short lived Buffalo Springfield Again in 1991 with Billy Darnell (guitar), Robin Lambe (bass) and [[Michael Curtis (musician)|Michael Curtis]] (vocals, guitar). But Furay issued a [[cease and desist]] order on Martin in 1992, and Martin retired from music again the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|title=Buffalo Springfield Rides Again, Along With Others|date=September 12, 1991|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812233311/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== 2010\u201311 reunion ==\nOn his album ''[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]'' (2000), Young sang of his desire to re-form the group and to \"see those guys again and give it a shot\" in \"Buffalo Springfield Again\".

In 1990, Bush played guitar and sang backup vocals on ''Big Back Porch Songs'', an album by the Hyras. ''Big Back Porch Songs'' was never released but Bush was given a copy.

The Hyras had made plans for future performances, but Annie had accepted a job in [[Miami, Florida]]; Bush replaced her.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\nAfter a year of performing, the two drove to Knoxville where they rented two days of studio time, where they recorded 14 original songs, assisted by their producer Danny Browns. The two released their first album together in 1991, ''St. Christopher's Crossing'', independently under the credit Andrew Hyra and Kristian Bush.<ref name=\"AMBP\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-pilgrim-mn0000770092 |title=Billy Pilgrim - Biography |access-date=October 25, 2023 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> They continued performing shows in southeastern college towns, and Bush reached out to various talent agents with their demos; Jen Stark, an intern at [[Atlantic Records]], recceived a copy, which resulted in commotion about them amongst the company. An indie label, Sister Ruby, expressed interest in the duo, and the two made another album for the label; it emphasized songs that weren't used for ''St. Christophers's Crossing'', which were quieter songs that couldn't be played in loud clubs.  The album was called ''Words Like Numbers''. Bush cited a large improvement between the two albums, because \"with ''St. Christopher's'' we didn't think, we just did it.  This time we had several weeks to think about what we were recording.\"<ref name=\"BP\"/> The album was a success in garnering attention; Atlantic Records held a release party for the two, and they were signed to the label that night,<ref name=\"BP\"/> in New York.<ref name=\"TED\"/> The duo name was officially changed to [[Billy Pilgrim (duo)|Billy Pilgrim]], named after a character from [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Billy Pilgrim Review |url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/268642485.pdf |last=Cook |first=Sean |date=February 17, 1994 |pages=2 |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]}}</ref><ref name=\"BP\"/><ref name=\"TOCBP\"/>\n\nThe duo released the self-titled album ''Billy Pilgrim'' in 1994, in association with producer [[Hugh Padgham]], who had a group of London musicians overdub the master with additional instruments.<ref name=\"BP\"/><ref name=\"TOCBP\">{{Cite web |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/kristian-bush-pre-sugarland-band-billy-pilgrim-lost-album-time-machine/ |title=Kristian Bush's Pre-Sugarland Album Band Billy Pilgrim Releasing Their Long Lost Album [Listen] |date=July 16, 2020 |access-date=October 25, 2023 |website=[[Taste Of Country]] |last=Trapp |first=Phillip}}</ref> Although the album itself received little attention, \"Get Me Out Of Here\" and \"Insomniac\", two songs on the album were, receiving heavy airplay on AAA radio. In 1995 they opened on a worldwide tour for [[Melissa Etheridge]], but copies for ''Billy Pilgrim'' weren't made in time to be promoted throughout it.<ref name=\"BP\"/> To increase their momentum, Atlantic Records made the two record another album in December 1994; unprepared, they scrambled to write new material two weeks ahead of the date of recording. They were paired with a group of veteran musicians who emphasized sounds that took away from their original music.<ref name=\"BP\"/> Their second album, ''[[Bloom (Billy Pilgrim album)|Bloom]]'', released in 1995. The lead single \"Sweet Louisiana Sound\" was a critical and commercial success, making a full rotation on [[VH1]].

Hyra moved to California but still kept in contact with Bush. Billy Pilgrim went silent temporarily as did Bush; he occasionally played at [[Eddie's Attic]], and did production work [[Ellis Paul]], Beth Wood, and [[Evan and Jaron]]. Bush announced the two were making separate solo albums in 1997, but such albums never released. Bush and Hyra collaborated for a \"farewell\" tour, and although they simply meant they were taking a hiatus, news spread they were disbanding.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\n==== 1999\u20132001: Billy Pilgrim hiatus ====\nIn 1999, Bush took interest in the newly developing format of online music distribution. He began releasing demos, outtakes, and live performances from Billy Pilgrim on the website [[MP3.com]]. He appreciated that he was able to release music easily without anyone else's approval. Bush partnered with MP3.com to release an old live performance of Billy Pilgrim at Eddie's Attic in 1998, ''Live from Wildhack, MT'', on the website. The performance also contained unreleased songs. Billy Pilgrim released ''Snow Globe'', a Christmas album, in November 1999, and ''9/23/00'', another live performance from Eddie's Attic, released towards the end of the year.<ref name=\"BP\"/>\n\nAll the money earned from the downloads on MP3.com Bush used to fund the next album and its physical release. The album, ''Billy In the Time Machine'', was recorded in four separate sessions over the course of eight months. Bush cited [[U2]]{{'}}s ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and [[Thom Yorke]] as inspiration for the album. It was released May 12, 2001.<ref name=\"BP\"/> The final works the two made together before unofficially disbanding were compiled into masters tapes. The tapes, as well as their studio, burned in a fire in late 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://magnetmagazine.com/2021/03/24/magnet-television-qa-with-kristian-bush-and-andrew-hyra-billy-pilgrim/ |title=Magnet Television: Q&A With Kristian Bush and Andrew Hyra (Billy Pilgrim) |date=March 24, 2021 |access-date=November 19, 2023 |website=[[Magnet Magazine]]}}</ref><ref name=\"BP\"/> One copy was salvaged from the accident and made into a CD, of which 500 copies were made and distributed at their final performance in 2001 at [[Eddie's Attic]].

She attended [[Trinity School (New York City)|Trinity High School]]<ref name=\"Deming\" /> where she studied jazz with Dr. [[Aaron Bell (musician)|Aaron Bell]], while singing in bands, playing in New York City clubs and bars.\n\n==Music career==\nIn 1999, Helm joined her father in his blues band The Barn Burners.  They toured the country playing traditional blues music.\n\nIn 2001, she was a co-founding member of alt-country ensemble [[Ollabelle]], which toured and recorded for 10 years, releasing three critically acclaimed albums, ''[[Ollabelle (album)|Ollabelle]]'' (2004), ''[[Riverside Battle Songs]]'' (2006), and ''Neon Blue Bird'' (2011).\n\nIn 2004, she and her father built the Midnight Ramble concerts at his home in Woodstock, New York. The concerts began as a [[rent party]] and grew into a Woodstock institution, featuring artists such as [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Allen Toussaint]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Phil Lesh]], and many others.\n\nGrowing out of the Midnight Rambles, [[Levon Helm]] recorded his first album in 25 years, ''[[Dirt Farmer]]'', which was produced by Amy and [[Larry Campbell]]. ''Dirt Farmer'' went on to win the [[Grammy award for Best Traditional Folk Album]] in February 2008. In 2009, they recorded ''[[Electric Dirt]]'', which won the first-ever [[Grammy award for Best Americana Album]] in 2010.  She also was a part of the live album ''[[Ramble at the Ryman]]'', recorded in 2008 at the [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville. This album won the 2012 Grammy award for Best Americana Album.\n\nHelm has extensive credits as a background vocalist and whistler on records by artists such as [[Steely Dan]], [[Mercury Rev]], [[Linda Thompson (singer)|Linda Thompson]], [[William Bell (singer)|William Bell]], [[Rich Robinson]], and [[Rosanne Cash]].\n\nIn 2015, she released her first solo album, ''Didn't It Rain'' which featured her father's last recorded drum performances. The album also featured members of the Midnight Ramble Band and Amy's touring band, as well as other players and singers such as [[John Medeski]], [[Bill Payne]], and [[Catherine Russell (singer)|Catherine Russell]].\n\nIn 2017, Helm recorded her second album with producer [[Joe Henry]] in Los Angeles. The album features musicians [[Doyle Bramhall II]], Tyler Chester, [[Jen Condos]], and [[Jay Bellerose]], as well as a background vocal section consisting of [[Allison Russell]], JT Nero, and Adam Minkoff.

Though each member was aware of one another, it was only Todd, Tim, and Andy who had played together. Tim, had joined Todd's band From Good Homes on stage, in addition Tim and Andy having a 20-year friendship through their former bands, The Blue Sparks From Hell, and [[New Jersey]] rock outfit [[Kings in Disguise]]. When rehearsals of original music, mostly written by Sheaffer, began occurring, the band soon realized that something musically unique was happening. After three weeks of rehearsing, they went into a local recording studio to track a five-song demo. Recorded live with no overdubs except backing vocals, this untitled demo set Railroad Earth's career in motion.  Within a week, they landed a slot at [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]], an appearance that was only the new band's tenth as Railroad Earth. The previous nine gigs had been little more than warm-ups at small North Jersey bars and Elks lodges and a couple of support slots for regional bands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |title=Railroad Earth &#124; Pollstar - the Concert Hotwire |access-date=2009-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810131640/http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2009/06/19/hotstar22833.aspx |archive-date=2009-08-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Realizing immediately how strong the initial five-song demo was, the band decided to return to the same studio to cut another five tracks to complete an album for release in time to debut at the [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]]. In early April 2001, the band tracked another five songs, and ''[[The Black Bear Sessions]]'' was completed. It was released to the public in June 2001, just one week before their appearance at Telluride. That album contains what are still some of the most popular songs in Railroad Earth's repertoire, including \"Seven Story Mountain,\" \"Head\" and, of course, \"Railroad Earth.\"\n\nThe band was approached by [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] after seeing their performance at Telluride. Right after their show, Railroad Earth was offered a record deal on the spot.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn June 2002, Railroad Earth released its follow-up album on Sugar Hill titled ''[[Bird in a House]]'', featuring such enduring songs as \"Like A Buddha,\" \"Mighty River,\" and the album's title track. Throughout that year Railroad Earth's touring schedule increased dramatically and their growing fanbase began to emerge as something tangible to promoters, radio stations and other media. They were garnering raves for their unique sound and exciting live shows and had become a staple act on the line-up of any roots, folk or [[jam-band]] festival. Their fans, who were now calling themselves \"Hobos,\" began to grow quickly in number, and the venues were getting larger along with them.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn late March 2003, Dave Von Dollen was replaced by Atlanta-based bassist Johnny Grubb. The following year, the band released its third studio effort, ''[[The Good Life (Railroad Earth album)|The Good Life]]'', featuring \"Storms\", \"Mourning Flies\" and \"Goat\".  The band continued to tour throughout the country, and its first live album, ''[[Elko (album)|Elko]]'', was issued in late January 2006.

Consequently, on April 6, 1966, Young and Palmer decided to leave Los Angeles and drive north to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. While the two were stuck in traffic on [[Sunset Boulevard]], they were spotted by Stills and [[Richie Furay]], who were heading the other direction down Sunset. Stills and Furay managed to switch lanes and maneuver behind Young's hearse, at which point the musicians pulled off the road and reunited.<ref name=\"WFP\" />\n\nDrummer [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]], who had played with [[garage rock]] group [[the Standells]] and with [[country music|country]] artists such as [[Patsy Cline]] and [[the Dillards]], joined at the suggestion of [[the Byrds]]' manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of [[steamroller]] made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on 11 April 1966, at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]] in [[West Hollywood]], five days after the chance encounter on Sunset Boulevard. A few days later, they began a short tour of California as the opening act for [[the Dillards]] and [[the Byrds]].\n\n=== Management and first recordings ===\n[[Chris Hillman]] of the Byrds persuaded the owners of the [[Whisky a Go Go]] to give Buffalo Springfield an audition, and they essentially became the house band at the Whisky for seven weeks, from May 2 to June 18, 1966. This series of concerts solidified the band's reputation for live performances and attracted interest from a number of record labels. It also brought an invitation from Friedman to Dickie Davis (who had been the Byrds' lighting manager) to become involved in the group's management. In turn, Davis sought advice from [[Sonny & Cher]]'s management team, Charlie Greene and Brian Stone; unbeknownst to Davis and Friedman, Greene and Stone then aggressively pitched themselves to the band to be their new managers. Friedman was fired, and Davis was made the group's tour manager. Greene and Stone made a deal with [[Ahmet Ertegun]] of [[Atlantic Records]] for a four-album contract with a $12,000 advance, following a brief bidding war with [[Elektra Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]], and arranged for the band to start recording at [[Gold Star Studios]] in Hollywood.\n[[File:City of Portland OR Archives.jpg|thumb|Buffalo Springfield Steamroller]]\nThe first Buffalo Springfield single, \"[[Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing]]\", was released in August, but made little impact outside Los Angeles, where it reached the top 25. Young and Stills have long maintained that their own [[Monaural|mono]] mix was superior to the [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]] mix engineered by Greene and Stone. The band's [[Buffalo Springfield (album)|eponymous album]] was released by Atlantic subsidiary [[Atco Records|Atco]] in mono and in stereo in October 1966.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6igEAAAAMBAJ&q=buffalo+springfield&pg=PP1|title=Billboard|date=October 22, 1966}}</ref> A revamped version issued both in mono and stereo with a different track order was issued in March of the following year.\n\n[[File:Buffalo Springfield Promotional Photo.png|thumb|The band in late 1966]]\n\nIn November 1966, Stills composed \"[[For What It's Worth]]\", responding to a protest that had turned violent following the closing of the [[Pandora's Box (nightclub)|Pandora's Box]] nightclub on [[Sunset Strip]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2007-aug-05-me-then5-story.html|title=Closing of club ignited the 'Sunset Strip riots'|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Cecilia Rasmussen|date=August 5, 2007|access-date=June 3, 2017|archive-date=January 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130193147/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/05/local/me-then5|url-status=live}}</ref> The song was performed on Thanksgiving night at the Whisky a Go Go, recorded within the next few days, and on the air in Los Angeles on radio station [[KHJ (AM)|KHJ]] soon afterwards.

Recording sessions were booked, and all the songs that appeared on the final album were recorded by the end of March, usually with Messina producing.\n\nIn the [[Netflix]] documentary ''Echo in the Canyon'', Stills related an incident that illustrated the band's problems with law enforcement. The band were hosting a small rehearsal party, attended by [[Eric Clapton]] among others, in April 1968.<ref name=\"break\" /> Despite reportedly playing at a comfortable sound level, a police officer arrived after a disturbing the peace complaint. During the encounter, the officer smelled marijuana and Stills ran next door to \"call lawyers,\" but in actuality went next door and escaped out the bathroom window. According to Stills, Young was going to chase the police down the street, to which Stills said \"cause he's Canadian and I guess in Canada you can do that\". Ultimately, Young, Furay and Messina were arrested and sent to the [[LA County Jail|Los Angeles County Jail]].\n\nFollowing a gig at the Long Beach Auditorium on 5 May 1968, the band held a meeting with Ertegun to arrange their breakup. Stills and Furay stayed with Atlantic, while Young moved to Warner Brothers.<ref name=\"break\" /> Later, Furay and Messina compiled various tracks recorded between mid-1967 and early 1968 into the third and final studio album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'' (1968).\n\n== New Buffalo Springfield and reunion attempts ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\n\nMartin formed a new version of Buffalo Springfield in September 1968. Dubbed New Buffalo Springfield, the lineup consisted of guitarists Dave Price ([[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]]'s stand-in with [[the Monkees]]), Gary Rowles (son of jazz pianist [[Jimmy Rowles]]) who later joined Arthur Lee's [[Love (band)|Love]], bass player Bob Apperson, drummer Don Poncher (also later a member of Love), and horn player [[Jim Price (musician)|Jim Price]], who later became a top session musician for [[Delaney Bramlett]], [[the Rolling Stones]], [[Joe Cocker]] and others.\n\nThe new band toured extensively and appeared at the highly publicized Holiday Rock Festival in San Francisco on 25\u201326 December 1968, but soon ran afoul of Stills and Young, who took legal action to prevent Martin from using the band's name. Following an agreement to give up future royalties from Buffalo Springfield's recordings, Martin was allowed to use the name ''New Buffalo''. He attempted to retrieve his rights in 1974 and though the matter was settled out of court, he felt that he had been mistreated.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|title=Dewey Martin: Drummer with Buffalo Springfield|date=February 7, 2009|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812233308/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/dewey-martin-drummer-with-buffalo-springfield-1570730.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn February 1969, Martin and Dave Price formed a second version of New Buffalo with guitarist Bob \"BJ\" Jones and bass player [[Randy Fuller (musician)|Randy Fuller]], brother of the late [[Bobby Fuller]]. The band made some recordings with producer [[Tom Dowd]] overseeing, but they were scrapped. Another guitarist, Joey Newman (formerly of Don and the Goodtimes, later of the pioneering prog group Touch), was added in June 1969, but two months later Martin was fired, and the remaining members carried on as [[Blue Mountain Eagle (band)|Blue Mountain Eagle]]. Martin then formed a new group called Medicine Ball, which released a lone album in 1970 for [[Uni Records]]. Martin also released two solo singles, one for Uni and one for RCA, which did not appear on the album. During the 1970s, he retired from the music industry and became a car mechanic.\n\nIn 1984, Bruce Palmer teamed up with Frank Wilks (vocals, guitar), [[Stan Endersby]] (guitar) and Alan Prosser (drums) to form the Springfield Band, which became Buffalo Springfield Revisited in 1985 when Dewey Martin was brought up to [[Toronto]] to join, and off they went on tour for the next three to four years under this band name (though Martin dropped out by 1987). Neil Young and Stephen Stills gave Buffalo Springfield Revisited permission to tour with that name.\n\nIn July 1986, Palmer, Martin, Furay, Young and Stills gathered at Stills' house, with Buffalo Springfield Revisited keyboardist Harlan Spector, to rehearse for an apparent reunion tour. One of the 1986 rehearsals was video recorded. It was the last time all five original members performed together. Plans for a subsequent reunion tour were abandoned.\n\nBy 1990, Bruce Palmer and Frank Wilks had moved to [[Topanga, California]], where Dennis Knicely joined to perform percussion. The following year they started White Buffalo along with Dewey Martin and others, then Martin formed the short lived Buffalo Springfield Again in 1991 with Billy Darnell (guitar), Robin Lambe (bass) and [[Michael Curtis (musician)|Michael Curtis]] (vocals, guitar). But Furay issued a [[cease and desist]] order on Martin in 1992, and Martin retired from music again the following year.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|title=Buffalo Springfield Rides Again, Along With Others|date=September 12, 1991|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=October 16, 2019|archive-date=August 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190812233311/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-09-12-ol-3130-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== 2010\u201311 reunion ==\nOn his album ''[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]'' (2000), Young sang of his desire to re-form the group and to \"see those guys again and give it a shot\" in \"Buffalo Springfield Again\".
