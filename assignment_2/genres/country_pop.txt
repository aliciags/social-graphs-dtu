She is signed to [[Big Machine Records]].\n\nIn collaboration with her family, Scott released the [[Gospel music|gospel]] album ''[[Love Remains (Hillary Scott album)|Love Remains]]'' in 2016 as a solo artist. The album reached number 7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Early life==\nScott was born in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to country music artist [[Linda Davis]] and Lang Scott, a musician and entrepreneur.  She has a younger sister named Rylee Jean, who was born in 2000. She is of Scottish and Native American descent. Scott was homeschooled on the road for kindergarten. She attended elementary school and high school at [[Donelson Christian Academy]] where she graduated in 2004. She lived with her grandparents during the time her parents were touring for her mother's musical career. After joining her mom on stage for a Christmas show, she was convinced to pursue a music career. Scott decided at age 14 to become a country singer, and her sister, Rylee, is 14 years younger than her; so she has a tattoo of the number 14 in honor of those two things.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.homecomingmagazine.com/article/treasures-linda-davis/|title=Treasures: Linda Davis &#124; Homecoming Magazine|website=Homecomingmagazine.com}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nAfter high school Hillary Scott attended [[Middle Tennessee State University]].

She ran into Kelley at a Nashville bar and recognized him from his [[MySpace]] page, where she had been listening to his music. She introduced herself to Kelley and complimented him on his music, which led to his deciding that they should get together with Haywood and write songs. The first song they wrote was \"All We'd Ever Need\". The song was originally written for her to perform; she convinced Kelley it should be a duet, which led to the forming of [[Lady A]], then known as Lady Antebellum. The group first performed together in August 2006 and signed a record deal with Capitol Nashville in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hillary Scott/Lady Antebellum|url=http://www.digitalrodeo.com/HillaryScottLadyAntebellum#fbid=U8pxKPxWoGm|publisher=Digital Rodeo|access-date=July 2, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907044202/http://www.digitalrodeo.com/HillaryScottLadyAntebellum#fbid=U8pxKPxWoGm|archive-date=September 7, 2008}}</ref> Scott says that being<!--to avoid false positives in search for 'being led/lead' typo --> lead singer of Lady A, as opposed to being a solo artist, lessens the pressure on her on stage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lady Antebellum Biography|url=http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,GAC_26071_5788001,00.html|publisher=[[Great American Country|GAC]]|access-date=May 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624182814/http://www.gactv.com/gac/ar_artists_a-z/article/0,,gac_26071_5788001,00.html|archive-date=June 24, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Lady Antebellum===\n{{Main|Lady A}}\nScott formed the country music group as Lady Antebellum in 2006, with co-lead singer [[Charles Kelley]] and backup singer [[Dave Haywood]].

The band's longest-tenured lineup consisted of [[Larry Stewart (singer)|Larry Stewart]] (lead vocals), John Dittrich (drums, vocals), Paul Gregg (bass guitar, vocals), Dave Innis (keyboards, vocals), and Greg Jennings (lead guitar, [[mandolin]], vocals). Record producer [[Tim DuBois]] assembled the band in 1984 to record [[demo (music)|demos]] and chose [[Verlon Thompson]] as the original lead singer, but Thompson was replaced by Stewart in this role before the band had recorded any material. Between 1984 and 1998, Restless Heart recorded for [[RCA Records Nashville]]. They released the albums ''[[Restless Heart (Restless Heart album)|Restless Heart]]'', ''[[Wheels (Restless Heart album)|Wheels]]'', ''[[Big Dreams in a Small Town]]'', and ''[[Fast Movin' Train]]'' in the 1980s.\n\nStewart departed for a solo career in late 1991, shortly before the band's fifth studio album ''[[Big Iron Horses]]''; the other four members began alternating on lead vocals in his absence. Innis also left before 1993's ''[[Matters of the Heart (Restless Heart album)|Matters of the Heart]]'', by which point keyboardist Dwain Rowe and guitarist Chris Hicks were added to their touring lineup. Restless Heart announced a hiatus in 1995, with Stewart continuing to record as a solo artist, Jennings joining [[Vince Gill]]'s touring band, and Dittrich forming [[the Buffalo Club]]. Stewart, Jennings, Dittrich, and Gregg briefly reunited for a tour and greatest-hits album in 1998 before disbanding a second time. They and Innis re-established the band's full lineup in 2001, after which they resumed touring and released their final studio album ''[[Still Restless]]'' in 2004. The band continued to tour and perform until quietly disbanding in 2021, shortly after Stewart began touring as a member of [[the Frontmen]].\n\nRestless Heart has released seven studio albums and two greatest-hits albums. Their second through fifth albums are all certified [[gold album|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. 26 of their singles have entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including six that reached number one: \"[[That Rock Won't Roll]]\", \"[[I'll Still Be Loving You]]\", \"[[Why Does It Have to Be (Wrong or Right)]]\", \"[[Wheels (Restless Heart song)|Wheels]]\", \"[[The Bluest Eyes in Texas]]\", and \"[[A Tender Lie]]\". The band has also had crossover success on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, including a collaboration with saxophonist [[Warren Hill (musician)|Warren Hill]] on \"[[Tell Me What You Dream]]\", which was a number one single on the latter. Restless Heart's sound is defined by their [[country pop]] arrangements and vocal harmony, with many critics comparing them favorably to the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tim Dubois, October, 2019.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Record executive [[Tim DuBois]] assembled Restless Heart in 1984.|alt=A headshot of record executive Tim DuBois.]]\n===Formation and early years===\n[[Tim DuBois]], a [[Nashville, Tennessee]]-based [[record producer]], songwriter, and industry executive, assembled the band in 1984 to record [[demo (music)|demos]] of songs he had written.

The group is composed of [[Hillary Scott]] (lead and background vocals, piano, bass), [[Charles Kelley]] (lead and background vocals, guitar), and [[Dave Haywood]] (lead and background vocals, guitar, piano, mandolin). Scott is the daughter of country music singer [[Linda Davis]], and Kelley is the brother of pop singer [[Josh Kelley]]. The band abbreviated the name to \"Lady A\" in June 2020 during the [[George Floyd protests]] in an attempt to blunt the name's associations with [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[Antebellum South]], inadvertently causing a dispute with Black blues and gospel singer [[Anita White]], who had been using the name Lady A for more than 20 years.\n\nThe group made its debut in 2007 as guest vocalists on [[Jim Brickman]]'s single \"[[Never Alone (Jim Brickman song)|Never Alone]]\", before signing to [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]]. Lady A has released six albums for Capitol: ''[[Lady Antebellum (album)|Lady Antebellum]]'', ''[[Need You Now (Lady Antebellum album)|Need You Now]]'', ''[[Own the Night]]'', ''[[Golden (Lady Antebellum album)|Golden]]'', ''[[747 (album)|747]]'', ''[[Heart Break (Lady Antebellum album)|Heart Break]]'', plus one Christmas album (''[[On This Winter's Night]]''), and one for [[Nashville Harbor Records & Entertainment]]: ''[[Ocean (Lady Antebellum album)|Ocean]]''. The first three albums are [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The albums have produced sixteen singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] and [[Country Airplay]] charts, of which nine have reached number one. The longest-lasting number one single is \"[[Need You Now (Lady Antebellum song)|Need You Now]]\", which spent five weeks at that position in 2009; both that song and 2011's \"[[Just a Kiss (song)|Just a Kiss]]\" reached number one on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary charts]].\n\nLady A was awarded Top New Duo or Group by the [[Academy of Country Music]] and New Artist of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]] in 2008. The band was nominated for two Grammy Awards at the [[51st Annual Grammy Awards]] and two more at the [[52nd Annual Grammy Awards]], winning Best Country Performance by Duo or Group with Vocals for \"I Run to You\". It was awarded Top Vocal Group, Song of the Year (\"Need You Now\"), and Single of the Year (\"Need You Now\") at the 44th [[ACM Awards]] on April 18, 2010. It won five awards at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]], including Song of the Year and Record of the Year for \"Need You Now\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/13/AR2011021303447.html?hpid=top |title=Esperanza Spalding, Arcade Fire top a night of upsets at 2011 Grammys |first=Chris |last=Richards |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 14, 2011 |access-date=February 14, 2011}}</ref> At the [[54th Annual Grammy Awards]], Lady A won the award for [[Grammy Award for Best Country Album|Best Country Album]] for ''Own the Night''.

Trying to become a successful solo country artist, Kelley convinced Haywood to relocate to Nashville in 2006 so they could write music together.

It was again recorded on a new record label: New Door/UMe Records. It was released while Cyrus was filming the show ''[[Hannah Montana]]''. ''Wanna Be Your Joe'' made it to No.&nbsp;24 on the Country charts and No.&nbsp;113 on the all-genre charts. The album initially sold well, but no hit-single was released.

Although not released as a single, a music video was made for the track \"Stand\", a duet with daughter [[Miley Cyrus]].\n\nAlso in 2006, Billy Ray appeared with metal-rock group [[Metal Skool]] (now [[Steel Panther]]), and performed several songs including \"[[Rebel Yell (song)|Rebel Yell]]\" by [[Billy Idol]], and the song \"I Want My Mullet Back\", which appears on ''Wanna Be Your Joe''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpah6c4plII |title=Billy Ray & Metal Skool |publisher=YouTube |date=November 1, 2006 |access-date=August 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924165227/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bpah6c4plII |archive-date=September 24, 2014 |url-status=live  }}</ref>\n\nHe also sang \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner|The Star Spangled Banner]]\" at Game 5 of the [[2006 World Series]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].\n\n===Career re-launch===\nIn mid-2007, Cyrus was a celebrity contestant on the 4th season of the show ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 4)|Dancing with the Stars]]''. Cyrus was partnered with [[Karina Smirnoff]]. He quickly became a fan favorite.

McClain's biggest hits include \"[[Who's Cheatin' Who]]\", \"[[Sleepin' with the Radio On]]\", and \"[[Radio Heart (Charly McClain song)|Radio Heart]]\".\n\n==Early life==\nMcClain was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], United States,<ref name=\"AMG\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/charly-mcclain-mn0000772541/biography|title=Charly McClain &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=8 August 2021}}</ref> to Virginia (n\u00e9e Wiggins; 1934\u20132009) and Niles McClain. The nickname \"Charly\" would come from the neighborhood friends that she played with as a child.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> McClain used it when she began her career playing hotel [[lobby (room)|lounges]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Her first experience recording was when father Niles had [[tuberculosis]] when she was eight.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> As she was under age to comply with [[hospital]] visiting policy, she had to communicate with him through a [[tape recorder]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> That inspired her interest in recording.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> She began her musical career at age 12 performing with her brother Mike and their band, Charlotte & the Volunteers. The band  performed together for the next six years.\n\nHer first TV appearance was on the local [[WBBJ-TV|WBBJ]] morning show in [[Jackson, Tennessee]]. By the age of 17, she was a regular on the club circuit, and appeared at the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] show ''Mid-South Jamboree'' from 1973\u20131975.\n\n==Recording career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2022}}\n\n===Steady rise===\nAt the age of 20, McClain signed her first recording contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1976. McClain's distinct vocal sound provided an edge in recognizability\u2014as did her attractive appearance.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> McClain debuted in late 1976 with her first [[Promotional recording|single]], \"Lay Down,\" which peaked at No. 67 on the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Chart]]. McClain's initial singles in 1976 and 1977, from her debut [[album]] ''Here's Charly McClain,'' failed to appear highly on the country chart. McClain's second album, ''Let Me Be Your Baby,'' was released in 1978. She hit country's Top Ten for the first time in 1978 with \"[[That's What You Do to Me]],\" <ref name=\"AMG\"/> followed by two other Top 25 hits, \"Let Me Be Your Baby,\" and \"Take Me Back.\"\n\nIn 1979 McClain released ''Alone Too Long'', which included the Top-20 hits \"When A Love Ain't Right\" and \"You're a Part of Me\". The ''Women Get Lonely'' album followed in 1980, featuring the Top 10 hit \"[[Men (Charly McClain song)|Men]]\",<ref name=\"AMG\"/> which peaked at No. 7 in 1980, and the Top-20 duet with [[Johnny Rodriguez]], \"I Hate the Way I Love It.\" However, breakthrough success still eluded McClain.\n\n===Achieving success===\nMcClain hit No. 1 on the country chart in 1981 with \"[[Who's Cheatin' Who]]\".<ref name=AOL>{{Cite web |url=http://music.aol.com/artist/charly-mcclain/biography/1001431 |title=Charly McClain biography at AOL.com |access-date=2008-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413194048/http://music.aol.com/artist/charly-mcclain/biography/1001431 |archive-date=2010-04-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1981, McClain scored three Top-10 hits off her ''Surround Me with Love'' album: the [[Surround Me with Love|title track]], \"[[Sleepin' with the Radio On]]\", and \"[[The Very Best Is You]]\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> McClain's albums were beginning to become more successful as well. Her ''Who's Cheatin' Who'' album peaked at No. 28 on the ''Top Country Albums'' chart, and her 1981 album, ''Surround Me With Love'' went to number 9.\n\nIn 1983, McClain hit No. 1 again with her [[Mickey Gilley]] duet \"[[Paradise Tonight]].\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=AOL/> McClain's and Gilley's duet partnership became so successful, they released a duet album the following year titled ''It Takes Believers.'' The record contained the Top-5 hit, \"[[Candy Man (Roy Orbison song)|Candy Man]]\" (No. 5 on the Billboard Country Chart), and the top 20 hit, \"The Right Stuff\".\n\nMcClain also acted; she appeared as a guest star on such shows as ''[[Hart to Hart]]''<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> (in 1981 episode titled \"Rhinestone Harts\") and ''[[CHiPs]]'' (in 1983 episode \"Country Action\"). McClain's lonely life on the road was also chronicled in a 1981 [[HBO]] special titled ''So You Want to Be a Star.''\n\nAfter having a series of hit singles in 1984, McClain released another best-selling album, ''Radio Heart'' in 1985. The album's [[Radio Heart (Charly McClain song)|title track]] became a No. 1 Country hit in 1985; McClain's last No. 1 to date. The album also spawned two other Top-10 hits that year. McClain married former soap star [[Wayne Massey]] in 1984, and their duet \"[[With Just One Look in Your Eyes]]\" reached number five.<ref name=AOL/> The third single off the album was also a duet with Massey. It was titled \"[[You Are My Music, You Are My Song]]\". The ''Radio Heart'' album peaked at No. 15 on the ''Top Country Albums'' chart in 1985. In 1986, Charly and Wayne released a duet album ''When Love Is Right'' and the first single \"[[When It's Down to Me and You]]\" peaked at No. 17.\n\n==Later years==\nAfter 1986, McClain's success began to subside. Her 1987 ''Still I Stay'' album brought only one Top 40 single; \"[[Don't Touch Me There]]\" peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Country Chart. The album became McClain's last album with [[Epic Records|Epic]]. Upon fulfilling her contract, she parted ways with the record label the following year. She continued to chart until her last recording came in 1989.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>   She recorded one studio album with [[Mercury Records]] before the end of the decade.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Her last charted single was \"You Got the Job\", which peaked at No. 65. McClain has not recorded a studio album since 1988's self-titled album on Mercury Records.\n\n==Retirement and family==\nPreferring to spend more time with her husband and their families, McClain retired completely from touring, public appearances, and performances in the early 1990s. Later, she helped to care for her mother Virginia before she died in 2009.<ref name=\"Shackelford Funeral Directors\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.shackelfordfuneraldirectors.com/obituaries/Virginia-Jo-McClain-5820/|website=Shackelfordfuneraldirectors.com|title=Virginia Jo McClain Obituary|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\nCharly McClain and Wayne Massey have no children together. However, Massey does have a son from his first marriage.\n\nSeveral compilation albums of McClain's music have been released over the years. Probably the most noteworthy of these is 1999's ''Anthology.'' It included all of McClain's successful singles from her career with Epic. She continues to reside with her husband Wayne in the Memphis, Tennessee, area.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Charly McClain discography}}\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Organization\n!Award\n!Nominee/Work\n!Result\n|-\n|1979\n|[[Academy of Country Music Awards]]\n|[[Academy of Country Music Award for New Female Artist of the Year|Top New Female Vocalist]]\n|rowspan=2| Charly McClain\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1980\n|Music City News Country Awards\n|Most Promising Female Artist\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3| 1984\n|Academy of Country Music Awards\n|Top Vocal Duo of the Year\n|rowspan=2| [[Mickey Gilley]] and Charly McClain\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| Music City News Country Awards\n|Vocal Duo of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|Female Artist of the Year\n|rowspan=3| Charly McClain\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1985\n|[[American Music Awards]]\n|Favorite Country Female Video Artist\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 1986\n|rowspan=2| Music City News Country Awards\n|Female Artist of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|Vocal Duo of the Year\n|Charly McClain and [[Wayne Massey]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040112054559/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/mcclain_charly/artist.jhtml CMT.com: Charly McClain]\n* {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000772541}}\n* {{discogs artist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Charly McClain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McClain, Charly}}\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:20th-century American women singers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American women country singers]]\n[[Category:Singers from Memphis, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Epic Records artists]]\n[[Category:Mercury Records artists]]\n[[Category:21st-century American women]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

When they broke up, Royce and his wife Melba moved back to Missouri. \n\nRoyce and Melba Kendall's daughter Jeannie proved to be musically talented from an early age, and as a teenager, she became her father's duet partner.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Country Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-726-6|page=215}}</ref> In 1969, when Jeannie was 15 years old, the Kendalls recorded an album for Stop Records, from which a single was released in 1970: a cover of [[John Denver]]'s \"[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]\" (previously a hit for [[Peter, Paul & Mary]]).<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The Kendalls' version narrowly missed the top 50 on the U.S. country chart. \n\nOn June 27, 1970, Jeannie provided vocals for the duet \"I Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way\" on [[Ringo Starr]]'s country album ''[[Beaucoups of Blues]]''.\n\nThe duo signed with [[Dot Records]] in 1972, and released an album and two singles, \"Two Divided By Love\", (a cover version of [[The Grass Roots]]' pop hit) and \"Everything I Own\", a cover of [[Bread (band)|Bread]]'s 1972 hit.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> \n\nThe Kendalls parted with Dot before signing with the independent [[Ovation Records|Ovation]] label in 1977.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Their first single for the label, a cover of the [[Kitty Wells]] hit \"[[Making Believe]],\" made the lower regions of the charts, but was largely overlooked because [[Emmylou Harris]]' version of \"Making Believe\" hit the U.S. country chart around the same time.  \n\nThe Kendalls' second single on Ovation, a \"cheating\" song called \"Heaven's Just a Sin Away\", proved to be their breakthrough.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The song topped the country charts, was a minor crossover pop hit, and won the 1978 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Country Vocal by a Duo or Group.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> \n\nSubsequent hits included \"Just Like Real People\", \"It Don't Feel Like Sinnin' to Me\", \"Sweet Desire\", \"You'd Make an Angel Want to Cheat\", and a cover of [[Dolly Parton]]'s \"[[Put It Off Until Tomorrow]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> (Jeannie Kendall's powerful soprano has often been compared to Parton's.)<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080128131109/http://www.keithcase.com/profiles/xjeannie/bio.html] {{dead link|date=August 2021}}</ref> In 1981, after Ovation Records closed their doors, the duo signed with [[Mercury Records]], and continued to have hits with the \"Teach Me To Cheat\" and \"If You're Waitin' On Me (You're Backin' Up)\", which both made the country top 10.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> More hits followed with \"Movin' Train\" and \"Precious Love\", which made the top 20.\n\nTheir last number-one country hit, 1984's \"Thank God for the Radio\", was also their last single to reach the top 10.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Their last top-20 hits came in 1984 and 1985 with \"My Baby's Gone\" and \"I'll Dance Every Dance With You\". In 1986, they signed with [[MCA Records]], where they scored three midlevel hits. In 1987, they signed with [[Step One Records]], where they scored several minor hits. In 1989, they signed with [[Epic Records]], where their last chart single, \"Blue, Blue Day\", made the top 70. \n\nJeannie Kendall was married to Mack Watkins.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> In the early 1990s, the Kendalls built a supper club in [[Gulf Shores, Alabama]], which featured nightly performances by them; the club closed down two years later. Afterward, they began performing in [[Branson, Missouri]], where the two families had built homes next door to each other. The Kendalls continued to tour and perform and released several CDs, until May 22, 1998, when Royce Kendall died from a stroke while on tour in [[Marquette, Iowa]].<ref name=\"usa-today\"/>\nJeannie Kendall, one of the original founding members of the Kendalls continues to tour and sing today with Carl Acuff Jr. They appear monthly at the Nashville Roadhouse Live, The Branson Star Theater in Branson Missouri. Jeannie Kendall is currently signed with Leaping Hawk Records, in the Ozarks. Jeannie and Carl tour as The Kendalls performing past hits and new.\n\n==Jeannie Kendall's solo career ==\nIn the years since her father's death, Jeannie has pursued a solo career, recording two solo albums, including a self-titled acoustic/[[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] CD on the [[Rounder Records|Rounder]] label that featured two songs recorded with Royce and several guest artists.<ref name=\"usa-today\"/> These guest artists included [[Alan Jackson]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Alison Krauss]], [[Rhonda Vincent]], and Johnny Long, who had been the Kendalls' backup singer on the road. The second was ''All The Girls I Am'', a much harder-edged pop/country CD released in 2005 on Golden. \nIn 2022 she released an album with Carl Acuff Jr. entitled \u201cYou Got Me\u201d recorded on The Leaping Hawk Records label. \n\nJeannie continues to tour and perform as The Kendalls, teaming up with Carl Acuff Jr. on harmony and lead vocals. \nThe Kendalls released a new single \u201cIsland in The Kitchen\u201d on CDX on the Leaping Hawk Records label, working with Bonnie and Rune Trulove, in 2022. \nThe Kendalls are managed by the Truloves. \nwww.jeanniekendall.com\nwww.leapinghawkrecords.com\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|The Kendalls discography}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1676/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography] at [[allmusic]]\n* {{Find a Grave|10910745|Royce Kendall}}\n{{Portal bar|Biography|Music}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kendalls, The}}\n[[Category:American country music groups]]\n[[Category:American country music duos]]\n[[Category:Grammy Award winners]]\n[[Category:Family musical groups]]\n[[Category:Ovation Records artists]]\n[[Category:Mercury Records artists]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1969]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

The group consisted of [[Gary LeVox]] (lead vocals), [[Jay DeMarcus]] (bass guitar, background vocals), and [[Joe Don Rooney]] (lead guitar, background vocals). DeMarcus is LeVox's second cousin, a brother-in-law of country music singer [[James Otto]], and was previously a member of the [[contemporary Christian music]] duo [[East to West]]. LeVox and DeMarcus are both natives of [[Columbus, Ohio]].\n\nFrom 2000 to 2010, the band recorded for [[Disney Music Group]]'s former [[Lyric Street Records]] division. While on that label, it released six studio albums, all of which were [[RIAA certification|certified]] platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The group's self-titled debut ''[[Rascal Flatts (album)|Rascal Flatts]]'' was released in 2000, and ''[[Melt (Rascal Flatts album)|Melt]]'' (2002), garnered their first number-one single, \"[[These Days (Rascal Flatts song)|These Days]]\". ''[[Feels Like Today]]'' (2004), ''[[Me and My Gang]]'' (2006), ''[[Still Feels Good]]'' (2007), and ''[[Unstoppable (Rascal Flatts album)|Unstoppable]]'' (2009) all topped the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] upon release. After Lyric Street closed in 2010, they moved to [[Big Machine Records]]. During their tenure with that label, they recorded five more studio albums: ''[[Nothing Like This (album)|Nothing Like This]]'' (2010), ''[[Changed (album)|Changed]]'' (2012), ''[[Rewind (Rascal Flatts album)|Rewind]]'' (2014), a Christmas album entitled ''[[The Greatest Gift of All]]'' (2016), and their final studio album ''[[Back to Us]]'' (2017).\n\nRascal Flatts released more than forty singles, sixteen of which reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]], [[Country Airplay]], and/or [[Canada Country]] charts. Their longest-running number-one, a cover of [[Marcus Hummon]]'s \"[[Bless the Broken Road#Rascal Flatts version|Bless the Broken Road]]\", spent five weeks at number one on Hot Country Songs in 2005. Through 2006 and 2007, \"[[What Hurts the Most#Rascal Flatts version|What Hurts the Most]]\" was number one on both the Hot Country Songs and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, and garnered their highest peak on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at number six. The band also had commercial success with a cover of [[Tom Cochrane]]'s \"[[Life Is a Highway#Rascal Flatts version|Life Is a Highway]]\", which they recorded for the [[Cars (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the [[Pixar]] animated film ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'' (2006). Rascal Flatts' music is defined by [[country pop]] influences, as well as their distinct [[Vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]]. In addition to their own music, DeMarcus has produced albums for [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Jennette McCurdy]], and [[Brooks & Dunn]] member [[Kix Brooks]].\n\nThe band was named [[Country Music Association Award for Vocal Group of the Year|Vocal Group of the Year]] by the [[Country Music Association]] every year from 2003 to 2008, Top Vocal Group by the [[Academy of Country Music]] from 2003 to 2009 and won the [[American Music Award for Artist of the Year]] in 2006. They were inducted into the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 2011 and received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2012. \"Bless the Broken Road\" was also named [[Grammy Award for Best Country Song|Best Country Song]] at the [[48th Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\nOn January 7, 2020, Rascal Flatts announced that they would be disbanding following a farewell tour after twenty years together. However, this farewell tour was canceled due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]; the group's disbandment was officially confirmed in October 2021.\n\n== Origins ==\n{{quote box|quote=We're not just business partners, we are good friends.

During his time on the tribe, he was quickly attracted to fellow contestant Brenda Lowe, who became aware of his attraction and used it to her advantage, recruiting him and several others into an alliance. After La Flor won three of the first four tribal immunity challenges, the tribes were blended and Rice ended up on the new version of the original \"older contestants\" tribe, Espada, while Lowe remained on the new version of the La Flor tribe. Rice and Lowe both ultimately made it to the merged group, Libertad, where their alliance successfully caused the eliminations of Alina Wilson and Marty Piombo, before turning on Lowe and eliminating her as a threat. Following Lowe's elimination, Rice continued with the alliance under new leader Matthew \"Sash\" Lenahan. After two contestants (NaOnka Mixon and \"Purple Kelly\" Shinn) quit, the alliance continued eliminating targets Ben \"Benry\" Henry, Jane Bright, Dan Lembo, and Holly Hoffman, although Bright and Hoffman were members of the alliance. The alliance tried to eliminate [[Jud Birza|Jud \"Fabio\" Birza]] as a threat against the jury, but Birza managed to evade them by winning the last three immunity challenges. Rice performed exceptionally well in the post-merge challenges, being on the winning team in two of the three team-oriented rewards, and winning the last two individual rewards. Eventually, Rice made it to the final three with Lenahan and Birza, where he had a chance to win the $1 million as \"Sole Survivor\". In pleading his case to the jury, Rice claimed that he was being open about how he played the game, but was criticized both for his rash decisions and occasional indecisiveness, as well as being perceived as a follower under both Lowe and Lenahan. Although both Rice and Lenahan tried to accuse Birza of not knowing what was going on in the competition, the jury still ultimately chose Birza who received five of the nine votes; Rice received the votes of Hoffman, Bright, Lowe, and Wilson.\n\nOn the nationally televised reunion show, Rice played his single \"Buzz Back\".<ref name=\"Country Song on Season Finale\">{{cite web|last=Wilkening|first=Matthew|title='Survivor' Finalist Chase Rice Debuts Country Song on Season Finale|date=December 20, 2010 |url=http://tasteofcountry.com/survivor-finalist-chase-rice-country-song-season-finale/|publisher=Taste of Country}}</ref> Although he received national media attention on the show, he says that reality show stardom did not help propel his country music career; instead, he cited it as an important life event that was more valuable than money and that put his life in perspective.\n\nIn the official issue of ''[[CBS Watch]]'' magazine, commemorating the 15th anniversary of ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' in 2015, Rice was voted by viewers as the 10th \"steamiest\" male contestant in ''Survivor'' history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/DaltonRoss/status/565168330513080320 |title=Wait, where's @JohnMCochran? |publisher=Twitter |first=Dalton |last=Ross |date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=February 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Country music career==\n[[File:Chase Rice Mojo Club 2020.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Rice in 2020]]\nChase Rice began playing guitar in college.

The album revitalized Parton's music career, spending five weeks at number one on ''Billboard's'' Country Albums chart, and also reached the Top{{spaces}}10 on ''Billboard''{{'s}} Top{{spaces}}200 Albums chart. It sold several million copies and produced four Top{{spaces}}10 country hits, including [[Phil Spector]]'s \"[[To Know Him Is to Love Him]]\", which went to number one.

''[[White Limozeen]]'' (1989) produced two number one hits in \"[[Why'd You Come in Here Lookin' Like That]]\" and \"[[Yellow Roses (Dolly Parton song)|Yellow Roses]]\". Although Parton's career appeared to be revived, it was actually just a brief revival before contemporary country music came in the early 1990s and moved most veteran artists off the charts.<ref name=allMusicGuide/>\n\n[[File:Dolly Parton with square red earrings.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Dolly Parton at a recording session {{circa|1989}}]]\nA duet with [[Ricky Van Shelton]], \"[[Rockin' Years]]\" (1991) reached number one, though Parton's greatest commercial fortune of the decade came when Whitney Houston recorded \"I Will Always Love You\" for the soundtrack of the feature film ''[[The Bodyguard (1992 film)|The Bodyguard]]'' (1992). Both the single and the album were massively successful. Parton's soundtrack album from the 1992 film, ''[[Straight Talk]]'', however, was less successful.

It was founded in 1981 in [[Apopka, Florida]], by Mark Miller (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Gregg \"Hobie\" Hubbard (keyboards, vocals), Bobby Randall (lead guitar, vocals), Joe \"Curly\" Smyth (drums), and Jim Scholten (bass guitar).<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=1057}}</ref> The five musicians were originally members of country singer [[Don King (musician)|Don King]]'s road band, but chose to stay together after King retired in 1981.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> After competing on the television competition series ''[[Star Search]]'' and winning that show's grand prize, they signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1984.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The band recorded for Capitol between then and 1991, and for [[Curb Records]] between 1991 and 2005,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> except for a short time in 2003 when they were signed to [[Lyric Street Records]]. Duncan Cameron, formerly of the [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]], replaced Randall in 1991, and Shayne Hill replaced him in 2004.\n\nSawyer Brown has released 18 studio albums and has charted over 50 times on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including three No.&nbsp;1 singles: \"[[Step That Step]]\" (1985), \"[[Some Girls Do (song)|Some Girls Do]]\" (1992), and \"[[Thank God for You]]\" (1993). The band's sound is largely defined by [[country pop]] and [[rock music]] influences, with cover versions of songs by [[George Jones]], [[Michael Johnson (singer)|Michael Johnson]], and [[Dave Dudley]] also among their hit singles. Artists with whom they have collaborated include [[Randy Scruggs]], [[Joe Bonsall]], and [[Mac McAnally]].\n\n==History==\nThe group's members were originally part of [[country pop]] singer [[Don King (musician)|Don King]]'s road band.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> When King stopped touring in 1981, the group decided to stay together. The band played up to five sets a night, six days a week (for a time at Knight's Corral, on Nolensville Rd., in Nashville, as \"Bobby, Mark, and Sandgap\"), until they auditioned for the TV show ''[[Star Search]]'' in 1983. They won the grand prize of $100,000 and a recording contract.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/sawyer-brown-mn0000837985/biography|title=Sawyer Brown biography|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=Allmusic|access-date=August 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe band originally chose the name Savanna. When another band with a similar name emerged, the group decided to change its own moniker.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> They met at their manager's office in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and began looking through area [[telephone book]]s for inspiration. They blindly landed on the name of a nearby thoroughfare, Sawyer Brown Road, and derived the new band name \"Sawyer Brown\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"oldies\">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Sawyer-Brown.html |title=Sawyer Brown biography |access-date=2007-12-09 |website=Oldies.com}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sawyer Brown.jpg|thumb|Sawyer Brown, 1987]]\nThe band signed with [[Capitol Records]] and scored a Top 20 hit with their first single, \"Leona\", in 1984.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> That success was quickly followed by their first No.&nbsp;1 hit, \"Step That Step\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> The band had their ups and downs on the charts throughout the 1980s, landing only sporadic Top 10 hits. However, by 1990 they had accumulated enough hits for a Greatest Hits package, and were successful on the touring circuit.\n\nOriginally, Sawyer Brown was known for a primarily [[country pop]] sound dominated largely by novelty tunes; by 1991, however, the band began to express a more serious side to its music by adding ballads to its repertoire.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> That year, the band also dropped its affiliation with Capitol, and Curb Records assumed promotion and distribution of all subsequent albums and singles (except for 2003, when Sawyer Brown temporarily switched to [[Lyric Street Records]]). Bobby Randall also left the band in 1991, and was replaced by Duncan Cameron.<ref name=\"oldies\"/> Cameron subsequently departed in 2004, with Shayne Hill assuming the role of lead guitarist.\n\nIn 1991, after the release of their album ''Buick'', guitarist Bobby Randall left the group to remain close to his family and host a short-lived TV [[talent show]], ''Be a Star''. Bobby Randall joined to band called \"Dallas County Line\" formed in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], in late 1991 & early 2003 are disbanded. Duncan Cameron, formerly of The [[Amazing Rhythm Aces]], was chosen as his replacement just as Sawyer Brown was about to become country music's \"it\" band. The band then switched labels, moving to [[Curb Records]] and releasing the albums ''The Dirt Road'', ''Caf\u00e9 on the Corner'', and ''Outskirts of Town'', which saw hit after hit for the band in the early to mid-1990s.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>\n\nPart of the band's new-found success was due to singer-songwriter [[Mac McAnally]], who wrote several songs for the group. The McAnally-penned songs, mostly ballads, helped to re-define Sawyer Brown, who up until this point had been reviled by many critics for being a flamboyant \"bubble gum\" pop act that emphasized style over substance. \"The Walk\", the final single off the ''Buick'' album, is said to be the turning point for the group.\n\nFollowing \"The Walk\", the band scored a number of Top 5 and Top 10 hits, including 2 more Billboard No.&nbsp;1s with 1992's \"[[Some Girls Do (song)|Some Girls Do]]\", and 1993's \"[[Thank God for You]]\", which Mark Miller co-wrote with Mac McAnally. By 1995, Sawyer Brown had enough hits for a second Greatest Hits package. The album, titled ''Greatest Hits 1990 to 1995'', included two new singles, \"This Time\" and \"I Don't Believe in Goodbye\", which themselves became Top 5 hits.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1990s, the group seemed to gradually fall out of favor with country radio, despite a crossover hit in 1999 with \"Drive Me Wild\". They parted ways with Curb in 2003 and signed with [[Lyric Street Records]]. One single was released on Lyric Street before Sawyer Brown left that label as well. 2004 saw the group returning to Curb Records, just as Duncan Cameron decided to leave the group to pursue a lifelong dream of flying for [[Southwest Airlines]]. Guitarist Shayne Hill replaced Duncan's post as guitarist, although both Cameron and Hill are in the credits on ''Mission Temple Fireworks Stand''. The album's title track, featuring [[Robert Randolph (guitarist)|Robert Randolph]], peaked at No.&nbsp;55. The second single off that album, \"They Don't Understand\", was a minor Top 40 hit on the country charts, and Top 20 on the Christian single charts.\n\nSawyer Brown has released twenty studio albums, of which three have been certified gold in the United States for sales of 500,000 copies. More than 50 of their singles have entered the U.S. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including three Number One singles. Sawyer Brown also received a Horizon Award from the [[Country Music Association]] in 1985, as well as a Vocal Group of the Year award in 1997 from the [[Academy of Country Music]] and five Vocal Band of The Year Awards from the TNN Music City News Country Awards.\n\nSawyer Brown wrote \"The Nebraska Song\" in honor of [[Brook Berringer]], a [[Nebraska Cornhuskers]] quarterback who died in a plane crash on April 18, 1996. (The song was actually written before his death.) The song appears on the group's album ''[[Six Days on the Road (album)|Six Days on the Road]]''. Mark Miller also served as a pallbearer at Berringer's funeral. In 1998, the band appeared at the [[Unforgiven: In Your House]] Pay Per View and performed a lip synced version of \"Some Girls Do\" with [[Jeff Jarrett]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/wwe-unforgiven-1998-best-and-worst-in-your-house/|title=The Best And Worst Of WWF Unforgiven: In Your House 1998|date=2018-12-03|website=UPROXX|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Mark Miller formed Christian music label [[Beach Street Records]]. One of the first acts he began producing for the label was [[Casting Crowns]]. In August 2021, bass guitarist Jim Scholten left Sawyer Brown in [[Seattle, Washington]].\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Sawyer Brown discography}}\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n=== Grammy Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[36th Grammy Awards|1994]]\n|\"[[All These Years]]\"\n|[[Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== American Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[American Music Awards of 1987|1987]]\n|rowspan=3| Sawyer Brown\n|Favorite Country Band/Duo/Group Video Artist\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[American Music Awards of 1993|1993]]\n|rowspan=2| [[American Music Award for Favorite Country Band/Duo/Group|Favorite Country Band/Duo/Group]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[American Music Awards of 1998|1998]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Music City News Country Awards & TNN/Music City News Country Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[20th Music City News Country Awards|1986]]\n|rowspan=10| Sawyer Brown\n|Star of Tomorrow\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| Vocal Group of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[26th TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1992]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[27th TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1993]]\n|rowspan=7| Vocal Band of the Year\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[28th TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1994]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[29th TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1995]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[30th TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1996]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[31st TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1997]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[32nd TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1998]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[33rd TNN/Music City News Country Awards|1999]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Academy of Country Music Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[21st Academy of Country Music Awards|1986]]\n|rowspan=4| Sawyer Brown\n|rowspan=4| Top Vocal Group of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[28th Academy of Country Music Awards|1993]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[29th Academy of Country Music Awards|1994]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[30th Academy of Country Music Awards|1995]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|\"[[This Time (Sawyer Brown song)|This Time]]\"\n|Video of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[31st Academy of Country Music Awards|1996]]\n|rowspan=2| Sawyer Brown\n|rowspan=2| Top Vocal Group of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[32nd Academy of Country Music Awards|1997]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[33rd Academy of Country Music Awards|1998]]\n|rowspan=2| Sawyer Brown\n|rowspan=2| Top Vocal Duo or Group of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| [[34th Academy of Country Music Awards|1999]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|\"[[Drive Me Wild (song)|Drive Me Wild]]\"\n|Video of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[35th Academy of Country Music Awards|2000]]\n|rowspan=2| Sawyer Brown\n|Top Vocal Duo or Group of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|Entertainer of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[36th Academy of Country Music Awards|2001]]\n|Sawyer Brown\n|Top Vocal Duo or Group of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n=== Country Music Association Awards ===\n\n{{awards table}}\n|-\n|[[1985 Country Music Association Awards|1985]]\n|rowspan=8| Sawyer Brown\n|[[Country Music Association Award for New Artist of the Year|Horizon Award]]\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|[[1992 Country Music Association Awards|1992]]\n|rowspan=7| [[Country Music Association Award for Vocal Group of the Year|Vocal Group of the Year]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[1993 Country Music Association Awards|1993]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[1994 Country Music Association Awards|1994]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[1995 Country Music Association Awards|1995]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[1996 Country Music Association Awards|1996]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[1997 Country Music Association Awards|1997]]\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|[[1998 Country Music Association Awards|1998]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.sawyerbrown.com/ Official website]\n\n{{Sawyer Brown}}\n{{CMA New Artist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Country music groups from Florida]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1981]]\n[[Category:Capitol Records artists]]\n[[Category:Curb Records artists]]\n[[Category:Beach Street Records artists]]\n[[Category:Lyric Street Records artists]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

Her mother was the country music star [[Dottie West]], whose career spanned three decades. The younger West reached her peak in popularity during the 1980s before mostly retiring in the wake of her mother's death.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===1981\u20131987===\nWest was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and rose to prominence at the same time as her mother Dottie was reinventing herself as a [[country pop]] star, and Shelly's style was not significantly different from that of her mother's. West is best known for her hit [[duet]]s with [[David Frizzell]], especially their number-one hit \"[[You're the Reason God Made Oklahoma]]\". She also was a successful solo artist, having her own number-one hit, \"[[Jos\u00e9 Cuervo (song)|Jos\u00e9 Cuervo]]\" in 1983. West was married to [[Gary Hood]] 1983-2000.\n\n===1987\u20131992: Retirement===\nWest did reunite with Frizzell for a few shows in the late 1980s. West married Garry Hood in 1983 and had twin sons.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p137248/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography at Allmusic.com]</ref> In 1990, Shelly toured with her mother, Dottie; together, they were popular on the road. On August 30, 1991, Dottie was involved in a major car accident, eventually dying five days later, on September 4, from injuries sustained in the accident. West was a technical adviser for a television biopic about her mother's life, ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', produced by and starring actress [[Michele Lee]]. At that point, amid major changes in the country music industry that impacted the careers of many established country stars, the younger West retired to focus on her family.\n\n===Post-retirement===\nIn June 2005, CMT honored Shelly and her duet partner, David Frizzell, when they were voted number six on its ''100 Greatest Duets Special''. Although they did not perform any songs, Shelly West and David Frizzell appeared on the special, for which West was interviewed. West appeared on numerous episodes of ''Country Family Reunion'' on [[RFD-TV]].\n\nWest has returned to performing occasionally since 2012. She reunited with David Frizzell for two shows on October 13, 2012, at the God and Country Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]]. The duo played another show on November 2, 2013 at the Americana Theater in Branson.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n!

The duo consists of singer-songwriters [[Jennifer Nettles]] (lead vocals) and [[Kristian Bush]] (vocals, guitar, mandolin). They were founded in 2002, at which point [[Kristen Hall]] (vocals, guitar) was also a member. All three had experience in [[folk rock]]: Nettles had recorded in the groups Soul Miner's Daughter and Jennifer Nettles Band, Bush had recorded two albums as one-half of the duo [[Billy Pilgrim (duo)|Billy Pilgrim]], and Hall had recorded two solo albums. After Hall left in 2006, Nettles and Bush continued as a duo.\n\nSigned to [[Universal Music Group Nashville|Mercury Nashville Records]] in 2004, Sugarland recorded four studio albums, one Christmas album, and one live album for that label between then and 2010. These albums accounted for fifteen singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including the number-one singles \"[[Want To]]\", \"[[Settlin']]\", \"[[All I Want to Do (Sugarland song)|All I Want to Do]]\", \"[[Already Gone (Sugarland song)|Already Gone]]\", and \"[[It Happens]]\". Nettles was also a featured vocalist on rock band [[Bon Jovi]]'s late 2005-early 2006 single \"[[Who Says You Can't Go Home]]\", which also topped the country music charts. Their four studio albums for this label \u2014 ''[[Twice the Speed of Life]]'', ''[[Enjoy the Ride (Sugarland album)|Enjoy the Ride]]'', ''[[Love on the Inside]]'', and ''[[The Incredible Machine (album)|The Incredible Machine]]'' \u2014 are all [[Music recording certification|certified platinum]] or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The duo went on hiatus in 2012, during which time both Nettles and Bush recorded solo albums. They reunited officially in 2017 for ''[[Bigger (album)|Bigger]]'', a studio album issued on [[Big Machine Records]].\n\n==Career==\n===2004\u20132005: ''Twice the Speed of Life''===\nNettles, Bush, and Hall were regulars in Atlanta's [[folk-rock]] scene in the 1990s and early 2000s before Sugarland was formed, playing frequently at [[Eddie's Attic]] in [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]], Georgia, which Nettles' ex-husband owned for a time.\n\nSugarland's debut album, ''[[Twice the Speed of Life]]'', was released October 26, 2004. Serving as its lead-off single was the song \"[[Baby Girl (Sugarland song)|Baby Girl]],\" which peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts and set a record for the longest chart run since the inception of [[Nielsen SoundScan]] in 1990; it was also the highest-peaking debut single for a group in 13 years. Also released from the album were the singles \"Something More\", \"Just Might (Make Me Believe),\" and \"Down in Mississippi (Up to No Good),\" which peaked on the country charts at No.&nbsp;2, No.&nbsp;7, and No.&nbsp;17, respectively. The album received Multi-Platinum certification for sales of three million copies, becoming their first album to achieve that status. In late 2005, the trio performed with [[Bon Jovi]] on [[Country Music Television]]'s musical fusion show, ''[[Crossroads (CMT TV series)|Crossroads]].'' Nettles sang with Bon Jovi on their single \"[[Who Says You Can't Go Home]].\" The song later went on to become a No.&nbsp;1 hit on the country charts. They toured the U.S. and Canada performing with [[Brad Paisley]] in 2005 and with [[Kenny Chesney]] on his ''Flip Flop Summer Tour'' in 2006\u20132007''.''<ref>{{cite news |last=Mansfield |first=Brian |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2006-11-01-sugarland_x.htm |title=Sweet success for Sugarland |work=[[USA Today]] |date=2006-11-01 |access-date=2008-09-03 }}</ref>\n\n===2006\u20132007: ''Enjoy the Ride''===\n[[File:Sugarland 2006-11-06.jpg|thumb|Sugarland performing in 2006]]\nKristen Hall left the group in December 2005.

She has placed seventeen [[Single (music)|singles]] in the top ten of the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. Eight of these songs reached the number one spot on the Country music chart.<ref name=\"Country Songs\">{{cite magazine |title=Janie Fricke chart history (Country Songs) |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/janie-fricke/chart-history/csi/ |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=2 January 2022}}</ref> She has also won accolades from the [[Academy of Country Music]], [[Country Music Association]] and has been nominated for four [[Grammy Awards]].\n\nFricke was born and raised in Indiana. She was surrounded by music from a young age and began performing locally. Fricke attended [[Indiana University Bloomington]], where she participated in the vocal group the Singing Hoosiers. Her participation in the organization led to further opportunities as a commercial jingle singer. She later moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where she was hired as part of a background vocal group called The Lea Jane Singers. As part of the quartet, Fricke sang background vocals on songs recorded by country artists in the 1970s. On one occasion, Fricke was asked to sing a solo part on a song by [[Johnny Duncan (country singer)|Johnny Duncan]] called \"Stranger\". It was released as a single and her uncredited vocal part attracted attention within the country music community. Nashville record label [[Columbia Records]] took particular interest in Fricke and signed her to a solo contract in 1977.\n\nFricke's early material explored diverse styles of music. Unsure of how to identify her material, disc jockeys gave her singles limited airplay. Songs like \"[[What're You Doing Tonight]]\" failed to become major hits and her producer suggested that she focus on one musical style. With a focus centered on ballads, Fricke's next releases proved to be successful. In 1981, she reached the top ten of the country charts with the song \"[[Down to My Last Broken Heart]]\". Over the next decade, Fricke had a series of top ten country singles. Six of these songs reached the number one spot including \"[[Don't Worry 'Bout Me Baby]]\", \"[[Tell Me a Lie]]\" and \"[[Your Heart's Not in It]]\". In the 1980s, Fricke also acted on ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' television series and designed belts and other clothing products.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Fricke left Columbia Records and signed with the smaller [[Intersound Records|Intersound]] label. During the early 1990s, the label released three albums of her material including a collection of [[Gospel music|gospel]] songs called ''[[Crossroads: Hymns of Faith]]'' (1992). At the end of the decade, Fricke formed her own record label and released several albums of material beginning with ''[[Bouncin' Back]]'' (2000). In 2004, she revived her catalog with a reworking of her former hits on the studio album ''[[The Bluegrass Sessions (Janie Fricke album)|The Bluegrass Sessions]]''. Fricke has since continued to perform and record, most recently releasing a Christmas collection in 2020 called ''A Cowgirl Country Christmas''.\n\n==Early life==\nJane Marie Fricke was born in [[South Whitley, Indiana]], United States,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=919/920}}</ref> to parents Waldemar and Phyllis Fricke.<ref name=\"Monroe County\">{{cite web |last1=Eckhart |first1=Tammy Jo |title=Singing Brought Her from Indiana Farm to International Fame |url=https://www.monroecountynow.org/blog/2019/12/19/singing-brought-her-from-indiana-farm-to-international-fame |website=Monroe County National Organization for Women |date=19 December 2019 |access-date=1 January 2022}}</ref> Both her parents had an appreciation for music.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web |last1=Deming |first1=Mark |title=Janie Fricke Biography |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/janie-fricke-mn0000210512/biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=1 January 2022}}</ref> Her father taught her to play the guitar, while her mother taught her the piano.

The group consists of Drew Womack (lead vocals, acoustic guitar), Michael Britt (lead guitar, background vocals), Dean Sams (keyboards, acoustic guitar, background vocals), and Keech Rainwater (drums). Britt, Sams, and Rainwater co-founded the band in 1992 with original lead vocalist [[Richie McDonald]] and bass guitarist/vocalist [[John Rich]]. Rich exited the band in 1998 and went on to join [[Big Kenny]] as one-half of the duo [[Big & Rich]]. Since his departure, Lonestar has relied alternatingly on session and touring musicians for bass guitar accompaniment. McDonald exited the band in 2007 to record as a solo artist, and was replaced by former [[McAlyster]] vocalist Cody Collins before returning in 2011. McDonald left a second time in 2021 to join [[The Frontmen]], with former [[Sons of the Desert (band)|Sons of the Desert]] lead vocalist Drew Womack replacing him.\n\nLonestar has charted more than 20 singles on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart, including 9 that reached No.&nbsp;1: \"[[No News]]\", \"[[Come Cryin' to Me]]\", \"[[Amazed]]\", \"[[Smile (Lonestar song)|Smile]]\", \"[[What About Now (Lonestar song)|What About Now]]\", \"[[Tell Her (Lonestar song)|Tell Her]]\", \"[[I'm Already There (song)|I'm Already There]]\", \"[[My Front Porch Looking In]]\", and \"[[Mr. Mom (Lonestar song)|Mr. Mom]]\". \"Amazed\" also charted at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming the first country song to do so since \"[[Islands in the Stream (song)|Islands in the Stream]]\" in 1983. \"Amazed\" and \"My Front Porch Looking In\" were the top country songs of 1999 and 2003, respectively, on [[Billboard Year-End|''Billboard'' Year-End]]. The group has recorded seven albums, one EP, and a greatest hits package for the defunct [[BNA Records]], and one album each for three different independent labels. Three of their albums have been certified platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The band's first two albums were defined by [[honky-tonk]] and [[neotraditionalist country]] influences, but subsequent albums largely drew from [[country pop]]. Along with his work with the band, McDonald has co-written singles for [[Clay Walker]], [[The Wilkinsons]], [[Billy Dean]], and [[Sara Evans]], in addition to singing guest vocals on [[Mindy McCready]]'s 1996 single \"[[Maybe He'll Notice Her Now]]\".\n\n==Foundation==\nLonestar began in 1992 as a band named Texassee. This [[portmanteau]] name was derived from the fact that all five members were natives of [[Texas]], and met in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]'s [[Opryland USA]] theme park.<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p165799/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Lonestar biography |access-date=September 30, 2010 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref><ref name=\"cmt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lonestar/bio.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040202192517/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lonestar/bio.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 2, 2004 |title=Lonestar: Biography |access-date=September 30, 2010 |work=CMT.com}}</ref> The original lineup consisted of lead singer/rhythm guitarist [[Richie McDonald]] ([[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]), lead guitarist Michael Britt ([[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]), drummer Randy \"Keech\" Rainwater ([[Plano, Texas|Plano]]), keyboardist/rhythm guitarist Dean Sams ([[Garland, Texas|Garland]]), and bass guitarist/lead and background vocalist [[John Rich]] ([[Amarillo, Texas|Amarillo]]).<ref name=\"oldies\">{{cite web|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-biography/Lonestar.html|title=Lonestar biography|work=Oldies.com|access-date=June 25, 2013}}</ref> Before Lonestar's foundation, Rainwater and Britt were members of the group [[Canyon (country music band)|Canyon]],<ref name=\"irwin\"/> which recorded two albums for the independent [[16th Avenue Records]] and charted in the country top 40 with \"Hot Nights\" in 1989,{{sfn|Whitburn|2012|p=63}} as well as receiving a nomination from the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]] for [[Academy of Country Music Award for New Vocal Duo or Group of the Year|Best New Vocal Duet or Group]].

He began in a number of local [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] bands in the 1970s, and from 1978 to 1982, he achieved his first mainstream attention as lead singer of the [[soft rock]] band [[Pure Prairie League]]. Gill sang lead on their hit single \"[[Let Me Love You Tonight]]\" in addition to writing several songs of theirs. After leaving Pure Prairie League, Gill briefly played guitar in [[Rodney Crowell]]'s backing band [[the Cherry Bombs]] before beginning a solo career in [[country music]] in 1984. Gill recorded for [[RCA Records Nashville]] from then until 1988 with minimal success. A year later he signed with [[MCA Nashville]], and he has recorded for this label ever since.\n\nHis commercial peak came in the first half of the 1990s, starting with his breakthrough album ''[[When I Call Your Name (album)|When I Call Your Name]]''. Gill has 65 entries on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, including four solo number one hits: \"[[I Still Believe in You (Vince Gill song)|I Still Believe in You]]\", \"[[Don't Let Our Love Start Slippin' Away]]\", \"[[One More Last Chance]]\", and \"[[Tryin' to Get Over You]]\", all between 1992 and 1994. He has also had number-one singles as a guest on [[Reba McEntire]]'s \"[[The Heart Won't Lie]]\" in 1993, as well as [[Chris Young (singer)|Chris Young]]'s \"[[Sober Saturday Night]]\" and the multi-artist collaboration \"[[Forever Country]]\", both in 2016. All of Gill's albums released in the 1990s were certified platinum or higher by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), with the highest being 1992's ''[[I Still Believe in You (album)|I Still Believe in You]]'' at quintuple-platinum. Gill has won 22 [[Grammy Awards]], the most among solo male country music artists.\n\nGill was a member of [[Western swing]] group [[the Time Jumpers]] from 2010 to 2020, and joined the rock band [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] in 2017 following the death of longtime member [[Glenn Frey]]. He has also participated in a variety of collaborations, including songs by [[Patty Loveless]], [[Brooks & Dunn]], [[Kelly Clarkson]], and [[Maren Morris]]. From 1980 to 1997 he was married to Janis Oliver, one-half of the country duo [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]]; after they divorced, he married [[contemporary Christian music]] singer [[Amy Grant]] in 2000. Additionally, Gill has written songs for [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]] and [[Ty Herndon]], and holds a number of credits as a backing vocalist and session musician.\n\nGill's music is known for his songwriting, his [[tenor]] singing voice, and his lead guitar work, with many critics noting his prolificacy in both ballads and up-tempo material. In addition to guitar, Gill plays [[mandolin]], [[banjo]], and [[Dobro]]. He has been referred to as the \"nicest guy in Nashville\" due to his pleasant mannerisms and frequent contributions to charity.\n\n==Biography==\n[[File:Norman July 2019 15 (E Main Street).jpg|200px|thumb|left|Gill was born in [[Norman, Oklahoma]].|alt=Businesses along a street in Norman, Oklahoma.]]\nVincent Grant Gill was born April 12, 1957, in [[Norman, Oklahoma]],{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=21}}{{Sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/vince-gill-mn0000214162 | title=Vince Gill biography | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=March 25, 2024 | author=Steve Huey}}</ref> as the youngest of three children to Jerene and Stan Gill.<ref name=\"okhistory\">{{cite web | url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry?entry=GI006 | title=Vince Gill | publisher=The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture | accessdate=March 25, 2024}}</ref>{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=26}} Stan Gill worked as a [[judge]] and also played guitar and [[banjo]], both of which he also taught his son how to play.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/><ref name=\"fame\">{{cite web | url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/vince-gill | title=Vince Gill | publisher=[[Country Music Hall of Fame]] | accessdate=April 18, 2024}}</ref> Jerene also sang and played [[harmonica]].<ref name=\"cst remz\"/> The Gill family often listened to the [[Grand Ole Opry]] on the radio, as well as contemporary [[rock and roll]] artists.{{sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=23}} Both parents also enjoyed [[golf]], a pastime which Gill himself would develop as well.<ref name=\"bmi\">{{cite web | url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20030828_pga_honors_bmi_country_star_vince_gill | title=PGA Honors BMI Country Star Vince Gill | publisher=[[Broadcast Music, Inc.]] | date=August 27, 2003 | accessdate=April 18, 2024}}</ref> As a child, Gill began playing a guitar his grandmother owned, and learned how to play \"[[Old Shep]]\" on it when he was five years old; three years later, he and his half-brother Bob played [[the Beach Boys]]' \"Long Tall Texan\" on a local radio show.

The song was originally to have been included on ''Turn Me Loose'', but was delayed until ''The Things That Matter'' due to legal complications between Gill's and Cash's labels.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=66}} The album accounted for another top-ten in \"[[Oklahoma Borderline]]\",{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} which Gill wrote with Crowell and [[Guy Clark]].{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=65-66}} The last single, \"With You\", was less successful.{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} To promote the album, Gill began touring as an opening act for Ricky Skaggs.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=67}}\n\nAuthor Jo Sgammato stated that while Gill's first two projects for RCA were not commercially successful, both were well-received by music critics and fans.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=71}} For his third RCA release, ''[[The Way Back Home]]'' (1987), Gill intentionally wanted to choose a new producer to vary his sound. He selected [[Richard Landis]], whom he also allowed to select material for the album. In addition, Landis allowed Gill to play mandolin, banjo, and Dobro as well as guitar.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=71-73}} Crowell provided backing vocals, as did [[Sweethearts of the Rodeo]], a duo consisting of Gill's then-wife Janis and her sister Kristine.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=74}} ''The Way Back Home'' produced four singles. First was \"[[Cinderella (Vince Gill song)|Cinderella]]\", written by [[Reed Nielsen]], which peaked at number five on the country charts in 1987.{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} The album's second and third singles \"[[Let's Do Something]]\" and \"[[Everybody's Sweetheart (song)|Everybody's Sweetheart]]\" were both top-20 hits, but the final single \"The Radio\" stopped at number 39 on the country charts.{{sfn|Whitburn|2017|pages=140-141}} After this album, Gill ended his contract with RCA as Galante wanted him to record only songs by other writers. Despite this disagreement, Gill stated that he left RCA amicably and still considered Galante a friend.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=89-90}} During Gill's departure from RCA, [[Dire Straits]] guitarist [[Mark Knopfler]] invited Gill to join the band on their then-upcoming world tour, but Gill declined as he wanted to stay within country music.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|pages=77-78}}\n\n===1989{{Ndash}}1992: Early years with MCA Nashville===\nGill had remained in contact with Tony Brown, who by 1988 was president of [[MCA Nashville Records]] and helped him sign a contract with that label in 1989.{{Sfn|Sgammato|1999|page=80}}<ref name=\"telegram\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/641561035/ | title=Songwriter is filled to the gills with country talent | work=[[Fort Worth Star-Telegram]] | date=October 13, 1989 | accessdate=March 31, 2024 | author=Shirley Jinkins | pages=11}}</ref> Brown would also go on to serve as Gill's producer throughout the entirety of the 1990s.

There, she was labeled as 'the little lady with the big voice'; recording country blues for the label. She soon settled in on recording country music with a blues overtone.\n\nDuring the 1970s, Scooter Lee toured alongside major artists, including [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Kris Kristofferson]], [[Tammy Wynette]] and [[Johnny Cash|Johnny]] & [[June Carter Cash]]. In the 1980s, Scooter Lee gained ground with her 5 piece band sponsored by the [[RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company]], working 10 months a year at every major state fair and other regional festivals. Performing 2-3 shows daily, 300 dates a year, taught her the art of fully commanding a stage.

Initially, Gayle's management and record label were the same as that of her oldest sister, [[Loretta Lynn]].  Not finding success with the arrangement after several years, and with Lynn's encouragement, Gayle decided to try a different approach. She signed a new record contract and began recording with Nashville producer [[Allen Reynolds]]. Gayle's new sound was sometimes referred to as [[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road]] (MOR) or [[country pop]], and was part of a bigger musical trend by many country artists of the 1970s to appeal to a wider audience. Subsequently, Gayle became one of the most successful [[crossover music|crossover]] artists of the 1970s and 80s.<ref name=\"You Don't Know Me\">{{cite magazine |last1=Betts |first1=Stephen L. |title=Crystal Gayle Sings With Loretta Lynn, Interprets Country Staples on 'You Don't Know Me' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/crystal-gayle-loretta-lynn-you-dont-know-me-album-904127/ |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=26 October 2019 |access-date=30 December 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Taste of Country\">{{cite web |title=Country Music's Most Powerful Women |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/crystal-gayle-powerful-female-country-singers/ |website=[[Townsquare Media#Web publications and services|Taste of Country]] |date=10 September 2017 |access-date=30 December 2019}}</ref> She is known for her floor-length hair.<ref name=\"Three Good Reasons\">{{cite web |title=SHORT TAKES: Hair Harasses Crystal Gayle |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-09-19-ca-874-story.html |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=19 September 1990 |access-date=1 January 2020}}</ref>\n\nGayle was said to have begun her career in the 1960s performing as a background singer in Lynn's band (although Gayle says this actually never happened).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Country music icon Crystal Gayle blows through Texas once again for renewed tour |url=https://sanantonio.culturemap.com/news/entertainment/country-music-icon-crystal-gayle-blows-through-texas-once-again-renewed-tour/ |access-date=2022-04-15 |website=CultureMap San Antonio |language=en}}</ref> Lynn helped her sign a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] in 1970. Having minor success, she was encouraged to develop her own musical identity. Under the direction of producer Reynolds at [[United Artists Records]], Gayle shifted towards a [[country pop]] style that was more successful. In 1975, \"[[Wrong Road Again]]\" became Gayle's first major hit. However, it was in 1977 when Gayle achieved her biggest success with \"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\". The single topped the ''Billboard'' country chart, crossed over to the top five of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and became a major international hit.\n\nGayle continued having success from the late 1970s and through late 1980s. Her biggest hits included \"[[Ready for the Times to Get Better]]\" (1977), \"[[Talking in Your Sleep (Crystal Gayle song)|Talking in Your Sleep]]\" (1978), \"[[Half the Way]]\" (1979) and \"[[You and I (Eddie Rabbitt and Crystal Gayle song)|You and I]]\" (1982). In the 1990s, Gayle shifted artistic directions by recording various genres of music. This included an album of [[inspirational music]] titled ''[[Someday (Crystal Gayle album)|Someday]]'' (1995) and an album of standards called ''[[Crystal Gayle Sings the Heart and Soul of Hoagy Carmichael]]'' (1999). During the decade she also owned and operated a fine arts shop called Crystal's Fine Gifts and Jewelry. Her most recent studio release was in 2019 and Gayle has since continued to tour throughout the world.\n\nGayle has won one [[Grammy Award]] and has been nominated for several others since the 1970s. She has also won five [[Academy of Country Music]] awards; those awards include receiving the Cliffie Stone Pioneer Award in 2016. In addition, she has won two [[Country Music Association]] awards and three [[American Music Awards]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked her among the 100 greatest country artists of all time and [[CMT (American TV channel)|CMT]] ranked her within their list of the 40 greatest women of country music. Gayle has her own star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] and was inducted as a member of the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in 2017.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Loretta-Lynn-Childhood-Home-Butcher-Holler-Van-Lear-Kentucky-2014.JPG|thumb|right|Webb family home]]\nGayle was born Brenda Gail Webb in [[Paintsville, Kentucky]] on January 9, 1951.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2020/01/09/UPI-Almanac-for-Thursday-Jan-9-2020/6871578415895/|title= UPI Almanac for Thursday, Jan. 9, 2020|publisher= [[United Press International]] | date= January 9, 2020|access-date=January 16, 2020 |archive-date= January 15, 2020|archive-url= https://archive.today/20200115192229/https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2020/01/09/UPI-Almanac-for-Thursday-Jan-9-2020/6871578415895/|url-status=live|quote=... country singer Crystal Gayle in 1951 (age 69)}}</ref> She was the last of eight children born to Clara Marie \"Clary\" ([[maiden and married names|n\u00e9e]] Ramey; May 5, 1912 \u2013 November 24, 1981) and Melvin Theodore \"Ted\" Webb (June 6, 1906 \u2013 February 22, 1959).

Trying to promote a five-song EP during the biggest economic upset in 100 years is uncharted territory. In some respects, the term 'the show must go on' has taken on a whole new meaning. We are living in a 'new normal' \u2014 one that involves a lot of 'making the best of it.'\"  She continued, \"I\u2019ve uncovered a surprising truth: the world is smaller. This virus has forced us as a planet to completely unite...I used to see life in five-year plans. Nowadays, it\u2019s in days \u2014 even hours.

In 1975, she released ''Whatever I Say Means I Love You'' (ABC/MCA), her fifth and final album for the DOT label, that included \"What Will the New Year Bring?\"\n\nDot Records was acquired by [[ABC Records|ABC]] and there was a noticeable drop-off in chart placings for Fargo, and in 1976, she moved to [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/>\nFargo came out with the ''On the Move'' album, which spawned two Top 20 hits. The next year her next album, ''Fargo Country'' was released.

Fargo's 1978 album, ''Shame on Me'' also yielded two Top 10 hits, the title track and \"[[Do I Love You (Yes in Every Way)]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;2.\n\nRecognized as one of the leading country songwriters of the era, Fargo's songs have been recorded by [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Sonny James]], [[Kitty Wells]], [[Tanya Tucker]], [[Jody Miller]], [[Marty Robbins]], [[Dottie West]] and other artists.

For the next few years, the successes came at a lower level.<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/>\nAlthough this serious [[neurological disease|neurological illness]] caused a deep decline in her promotional work, Fargo vowed not to allow the disease ultimately to get to her. In 1979, she recorded a new album, ''Just for You,'' from which the biggest hit was the No. 14 hit \"Daddy\", a new version of a song that Fargo had recorded in 1969. The follow-up, \"Preacher Berry\", peaked outside the Country Top 40.\n\n===1980 \u2013 present: current music career===\nFargo released one more album with Warner Bros. in 1980 before switching to the smaller Songbird label in 1981.

She recorded a single for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in 1983, and for Cleveland records in 1984. By now, Fargo's career had begun to decline in terms of album sales and chart placements. After several other label changes, Fargo signed with [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], and began another upswing.<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/> She recorded an album with the label, ''Winners,'' which resulted in three singles spawned from the album, including a Top 30 hit, \"Me and You\". Fargo also dueted with [[Billy Joe Royal]] for her next single, \"Members Only\". The song became a Top 25 country hit in 1987, peaking at No.&nbsp;23. In 1991, she released the song \"Soldier Boy\", a reference to the [[Gulf War]] which was going on at the time. The song was Fargo's last charting single. After several years without a full-length recording, in 1992, Fargo began work on her autobiography.<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/> In 2008, Fargo released a new single CD, \"We Can Do Better in America\". On February 4, 2022, PrimaDonna Records announced the release of Donna Fargo's new EP, [http://www.primadonnaentertainmentcorp.com \"ALL BECAUSE OF YOU\"].\n\n==Writing career==\nFargo has pursued other ventures outside of the music business, writing eight books and more than 2,000 greeting cards. She has since established a successful line of [[greeting cards]] in ''The Donna Fargo Collection'' through the ''[[Blue Mountain Arts]]'' Poets and Artists series. She released her fourth book in March 2010, entitled ''I Thanked God For You Today''.<ref>[Blue Mountain Press/P.O.

During this period, she publicly spoke about her struggles with [[postpartum depression]],  later the focus of her book ''Behind the Smile: My Journey Out of Postpartum Depression''. In 2004, she hosted her own radio series, entitled ''Marie & Friends'' and, in 2007, appeared in a season of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''.\n\nShe and Donny reunited their act between 2008 and 2019 for a residency at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]]. The show later produced an album of their duets in 2009. In 2010, she returned with the solo studio album ''[[I Can Do This]]''. In 2016, her country album ''[[Music Is Medicine]]'' followed and then, in 2021, came her [[Classical music|classical]] album, ''Unexpected''.
