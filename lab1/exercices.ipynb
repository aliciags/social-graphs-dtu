For the last, he was especially praised by his contemporaries, who extolled him as a masterly interpreter of biblical stories for his skill in representing emotions and attention to detail.<ref>van der Wetering, p. 268.</ref> Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early \"smooth\" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late \"rough\" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself. Rembrandt must have realized that if he kept the paint deliberately loose and \"paint-like\" on some parts of the canvas, the perception of space became much greater.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 160, 190.</ref> \\n\\nA parallel development may be seen in Rembrandt\\'s skill as a printmaker. In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well. The works encompass a wide range of subject matter and technique, sometimes leaving large areas of white paper to suggest space, at other times employing complex webs of line to produce rich dark tones.<ref>Ackley, p. 14.</ref>\\n\\nLastman\\'s influence on Rembrandt was most prominent during his period in Leiden from 1625 to 1631.<ref name=\"Wetering-284\">van de Wetering, p. 284.</ref> Paintings were rather small but rich in details (for example, in costumes and jewelry). Religious and [[allegory|allegorical]] themes were favored, as were [[tronie]]s.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1626 Rembrandt produced his first etchings, the wide dissemination of which would largely account for his international fame.<ref name=Wetering-284/> In 1629, he completed \\'\\'[[Judas Repentant, Returning the Pieces of Silver]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Artist in his studio|The Artist in His Studio]]\\'\\', works that evidence his interest in the handling of light and variety of paint application and constitute the first major progress in his development as a painter.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 285.</ref>\\n\\nDuring his early years in Amsterdam (1632–1636), Rembrandt began to paint dramatic biblical and mythological scenes in high contrast and of large format (\\'\\'[[The Blinding of Samson]]\\'\\', 1636, \\'\\'[[Belshazzar\\'s Feast (Rembrandt)|Belshazzar\\'s Feast]]\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1635 \\'\\'[[Danaë (Rembrandt)|Danaë]]\\'\\', 1636 but reworked later), seeking to emulate the baroque style of [[Rubens]].<ref>van de Wetering, p. 287.</ref> With the occasional help of assistants in Uylenburgh\\'s workshop, he painted numerous portrait commissions both small ([[Jacob de Gheyn III (painting)|\\'\\'Jacob de Gheyn&nbsp;III\\'\\']]) and large (\\'\\'Portrait of the Shipbuilder Jan Rijcksen and his Wife\\'\\', 1633, \\'\\'[[Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp]]\\'\\', 1632).<ref>van de Wetering, p. 286.</ref>\\n\\nBy the late 1630s, Rembrandt had produced a few paintings and many etchings of [[landscape painting|landscapes]]. Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (\\'\\'Cottages before a Stormy Sky\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1641; \\'\\'The Three Trees\\'\\', 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the [[New Testament]] than the [[Old Testament]], as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted \\'\\'[[The Night Watch]]\\'\\', the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 288.</ref>\\n\\nIn the decade following the \\'\\'Night Watch\\'\\', Rembrandt\\'s paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (\\'\\'Susanna and the Elders\\'\\', 1637–47).<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 163–165.</ref> At the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 289.</ref> In these graphic works natural drama eventually made way for quiet Dutch rural scenes.\\n\\nIn the 1650s, Rembrandt\\'s style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of [[Titian]], and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of \\'finish\\' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt\\'s brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 155–165.</ref> The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting\\'s surface. The result is a richly varied handling of paint, deeply layered and often apparently haphazard, which suggests form and space in both an illusory and highly individual manner.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 157–158, 190.</ref>\\n\\nIn later years, [[Bible|biblical]] themes were often depicted but emphasis shifted from dramatic group scenes to intimate portrait-like figures (\\'\\'James the Apostle\\'\\', 1661). In his last years, Rembrandt painted his most deeply reflective self-portraits (from 1652 to 1669 he painted fifteen), and several moving images of both men and women (\\'\\'[[The Jewish Bride]]\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1666)—in love, in life, and before God.<ref>\"In Rembrandt\\'s (late) great portraits we feel face to face with real people, we sense their warmth, their need for sympathy and also their loneliness and suffering.

Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work.<ref>Schwartz, 1994, pp. 8–12</ref> He took easily to etching and, though he learned to use a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] and partly [[engraving|engraved]] many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<ref>White 1969, pp. 5–6</ref> He worked on the so-called \\'\\'[[Hundred Guilder Print]]\\'\\' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.<ref>White 1969, p. 6</ref>\\nAlthough the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.<ref>White 1969, pp. 6, 9–10</ref>\\n\\nIn the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used [[hatching]] to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including [[Japanese paper]], which he used frequently, and on [[vellum]]. He began to use \"[[surface tone]],\" leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of [[drypoint]], exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.<ref>White, 1969 pp. 6–7</ref>\\n\\nHis prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the 27 self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. The landscapes, mostly small, largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century. Of the many hundreds of drawings Rembrandt made, only about two hundred have a landscape motif as their subject, and of the approximately three hundred etchings, about thirty show a landscape. As for his painted landscapes, one does not even get beyond eight works.<ref>\\n\\nChristiaan Vogelaar &  Gregor J.M.

After it was cleaned, it was discovered to represent broad day—a party of 18 [[musketeer]]s stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight. For [[Théophile Thoré]] it was the prettiest painting in the world. \\n\\nThe piece was commissioned for the new hall of the \\'\\'[[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]]\\'\\', the musketeer branch of the [[schutterij|civic militia]]. Rembrandt departed from convention, which ordered that such genre pieces should be stately and formal, rather a line-up than an action scene. Instead, he showed the militia readying themselves to embark on a mission, though the exact nature of the mission or event is a matter of ongoing debate.\\n\\nContrary to what is often said, the work was hailed as a success from the beginning. Parts of the canvas were cut off (approximately 20% from the left-hand side was removed) to make the painting fit its new position when it was moved to the [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|town hall]] in 1715. In 1817 this large painting was moved to the [[Trippenhuis]].

Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new [[catalogue raisonné]] of his paintings. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Rembrandt Research Project: Past, Present, Future |url=http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf |access-date=11 August 2014 |archive-date=22 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822083100/http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Many of those removed are now thought to be the work of his students.\\n\\nOne example of activity is \\'\\'[[The Polish Rider]]\\'\\', now housed in the [[Frick Collection]] in New York City. Rembrandt\\'s authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, [[Julius S. Held]], agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr.&nbsp;Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt\\'s closest and most talented pupils, [[Willem Drost]], about whom little is known. But Bruyn\\'s remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost\\'s authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick; In his 1999 book \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\', [[Simon Schama]] and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both argued for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt\\'s authorship feel that the execution is uneven and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.<ref>See \"Further Battles for the \\'Lisowczyk\\' (Polish Rider) by Rembrandt\" Zdzislaw Zygulski, Jr., \\'\\'Artibus et Historiae\\'\\', Vol. 21, No. 41 (2000), pp. 197–205.

There is a book on the subject:\\'\\'Responses to Rembrandt; Who painted the Polish Rider?\\'\\' by Anthony Bailey (New York, 1993)</ref>\\n\\nA similar issue was raised by Schama concerning the verification of titles associated with the subject matter depicted in Rembrandt\\'s works. For example, the exact subject being portrayed in \\'\\'[[Aristotle with a Bust of Homer]]\\'\\', recently retitled by curators at the Metropolitan Museum, has been directly challenged by Schama applying the scholarship of Paul Crenshaw.<ref>Schama, Simon (1999). \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\'. Knopf, p. 720.</ref> Schama presents a substantial argument that it was the famous ancient Greek painter [[Apelles]] who is depicted in contemplation by Rembrandt and not Aristotle.<ref>Schama, pp. 582–591.</ref>\\n\\nAnother painting, \\'\\'Pilate Washing His Hands\\'\\', is also of questionable attribution. Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt. Scholars have since dated the painting to the 1660s and assigned it to an anonymous pupil, possibly Aert de Gelder. The composition bears superficial resemblance to mature works by Rembrandt but lacks the master\\'s command of illumination and modeling.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rembrandt Pilate Washing His Hands Oil Painting Reproduction |url=http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |access-date=1 January 2015 |publisher=Outpost Art |archive-date=12 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112111138/http://www.outpost-art.org/pilate-washing-his-hands-p-37320.html |url-status=live }}</ref>\\n\\nThe attribution and re-attribution work is ongoing.

In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, \"RHL-van Rijn\" but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, \"Rembrant\".

Paul Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles, in total 86 paintings.<ref>Clark 1974, pp. 147–150. See the catalogue in Further reading for the location of all accepted Rembrandts</ref> Other large groups are in Germany, with 69 paintings, at the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] in Berlin, [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] in Dresden, and [[Schloss Wilhelmshöhe]] in Kassel, and elsewhere. The UK has a total of 51, especially in the [[National Gallery]] and [[Royal Collection]].

The [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] in Warsaw displays two paintings by Rembrandt.<ref name=zamek/>\\n\\nThe largest collections of drawings are in the older large museums such as the Rijksmuseum, Louvre and [[British Museum]]. All major [[print room]]s have large collections of Rembrandt prints, although as some exist in only a single impression, no collection is complete. The degree to which these collections are displayed to the public or can easily be viewed by them in the print room, varies greatly.\\n\\nThe [[Rembrandt House Museum]] has fittings and furniture that are mostly not original but period pieces comparable to those Rembrandt might have had, and those in the many drawings and etchings set in the house, and contemporary paintings reflecting Rembrandt\\'s use of the house for art dealing. His printmaking studio has been set up with a printing press, where replica prints are printed. The museum has a few early Rembrandt paintings, many loaned but an important collection of his prints, a good selection of which are on rotating display.\\n\\n== Works about Rembrandt ==\\n{{See also|Category:Works about Rembrandt}}\\n\\n=== Literary works (e.g. poetry and fiction) ===\\n* \\'\\'To the Picture of Rembrandt\\'\\', a Russian-language poem by [[Mikhail Lermontov]], 1830\\n* \\'\\'[[Gaspard de la Nuit (poetry collection)|Gaspard de la nuit: Fantaisies à la manière de Rembrandt et de Callot]]\\'\\', a series of French-language poems by [[Aloysius Bertrand]], 1842\\n* \\'\\'[[Picture This (novel)|Picture This]]\\'\\', a novel by [[Joseph Heller]], 1988\\n* \\'\\'Moi, la Putain de Rembrandt\\'\\', a French-language novel by Sylvie Matton, 1998\\n* \\'\\'Van Rijn\\'\\', a novel by Sarah Emily Miano, 2006\\n* \\'\\'[[I Am Rembrandt\\'s Daughter]]\\'\\', a novel by Lynn Cullen, 2007\\n* \\'\\'[[The Rembrandt Affair]]\\'\\', a novel by [[Daniel Silva (novelist)|Daniel Silva]], 2011\\n* \\'\\'The Anatomy Lesson\\'\\', a novel by Nina Siegal, 2014\\n* \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Mirror\\'\\', a novel by Kim Devereux, 2015\\n\\n=== Music ===\\n*The [[Donna Summer]] song \\'\\'[[Dinner with Gershwin]]\\'\\' contain the lyrics \"I want to watch Rembrandt sketch.\"\\n*The [[Scott Walker (singer)]] song Duchess features the lyrics “It’s your Bicycle bells / and your Rembrandt swells”\\n\\n=== Films ===\\n* \\'\\'[[The Stolen Rembrandt]]\\'\\', a 1914 film directed by [[Leo D.

One of the most influential artists of the 20th century, he is known for co-founding the [[Cubist]] movement, the invention of [[Assemblage (art)|constructed sculpture]],<ref name=\"moma4\"/><ref name=\"tate1\"/> the co-invention of [[collage]], and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the [[Proto-Cubism|proto-Cubist]] \\'\\'[[Les Demoiselles d\\'Avignon]]\\'\\' (1907) and the anti-war painting \\'\\'[[Guernica (Picasso)|Guernica]]\\'\\' (1937), a dramatic portrayal of the [[bombing of Guernica]] by German and Italian air forces during the [[Spanish Civil War]].\\n\\nPicasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent in his early years, painting in a naturalistic manner through his childhood and adolescence. During the first decade of the 20th century, his style changed as he experimented with different theories, techniques, and ideas. After 1906, the [[Fauvist]] work of the older artist [[Henri Matisse]] motivated Picasso to explore more radical styles, beginning a fruitful rivalry between the two artists, who subsequently were often paired by critics as the leaders of [[modern art]].<ref name=\"tate0\"/><ref name=\"fran5\"/><ref name=\"guar6\"/><ref name=\"k12ok\"/>\\n\\nPicasso\\'s output, especially in his early career, is often periodized. While the names of many of his later periods are debated, the most commonly accepted periods in his work are the [[Picasso\\'s Blue Period|Blue Period]] (1901–1904), the [[Picasso\\'s Rose Period|Rose Period]] (1904–1906), the [[Picasso\\'s African Period|African-influenced Period]] (1907–1909), Analytic [[Cubism]] (1909–1912), and Synthetic Cubism (1912–1919), also referred to as the [[Crystal Cubism|Crystal period]]. Much of Picasso\\'s work of the late 1910s and early 1920s is in a [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style, and his work in the mid-1920s often has characteristics of [[Surrealism]]. His later work often combines elements of his earlier styles.\\n\\nExceptionally prolific throughout the course of his long life, Picasso achieved universal renown and immense fortune for his revolutionary artistic accomplishments, and became one of the best-known figures in [[20th-century art]].\\n\\n== Early life ==\\n[[File:Pablo Picasso with his sister Lola, 1889.jpg|thumb|upright |left|Picasso with his sister Lola, 1889]]\\nPicasso was born at 23:15 on 25 October 1881, in the city of [[Málaga]], Andalusia, in southern Spain.<ref name=\"PCp15\"/> He was the first child of [[José Ruiz y Blasco|Don José Ruiz y Blasco]] (1838–1913) and María Picasso y López.<ref name=\"collier\"/> Picasso\\'s family was of middle-class background. His father was a painter who specialized in naturalistic depictions of birds and other game. For most of his life, Ruiz was a professor of art at the School of Crafts and a [[curator]] of a local museum.<ref name=\"CatRez\"/>\\n\\nPicasso\\'s birth certificate and the record of his baptism include very long names, combining those of various saints and relatives.{{efn|name=\"names\"}}{{efn|Though baptized a Catholic, Picasso would later become an atheist.<ref name=\"thepi\"/>}} \\'\\'Ruiz y Picasso\\'\\' were his paternal and maternal surnames, respectively, per Spanish custom. The surname \"Picasso\" comes from [[Liguria]], a coastal region of north-western Italy.<ref name=\"Fundación Picasso\"/> Pablo\\'s maternal great-grandfather, Tommaso Picasso, moved to Spain around 1807.<ref name=\"Fundación Picasso\"/>\\n\\nPicasso showed a passion and a skill for drawing from an early age. According to his mother, his first words were \"piz, piz\", a shortening of \\'\\'lápiz\\'\\', the Spanish word for \"pencil\".<ref name=\"Wert9\"/> From the age of seven, Picasso received formal artistic training from his father in figure drawing and oil painting. Ruiz was a traditional academic artist and instructor, who believed that proper training required disciplined copying of the masters, and drawing the human body from plaster casts and live models. His son became preoccupied with art to the detriment of his classwork.<ref>{{Cite web |title=15 Pablo Picasso Fun Facts |url=https://www.pablopicasso.org/picasso-facts.jsp |access-date=22 September 2023 |website=www.pablopicasso.org}}</ref>\\n\\nThe family moved to [[A Coruña]] in 1891, where his father became a professor at the School of Fine Arts. They stayed for almost four years. On one occasion, the father found his son painting over his unfinished sketch of a pigeon. Observing the precision of his son\\'s technique, an apocryphal story relates, Ruiz felt that the thirteen-year-old Picasso had surpassed him, and vowed to give up painting,<ref name=\"wert11\"/> though paintings by him exist from later years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=15 Pablo Picasso Fun Facts |url=https://www.pablopicasso.org/picasso-facts.jsp |access-date=22 September 2023 |website=www.pablopicasso.org}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 1895, Picasso was traumatized when his seven-year-old sister, Conchita, died of [[diphtheria]].<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\"/> After her death, the family moved to [[Barcelona]], where Ruiz took a position at its School of Fine Arts. Picasso thrived in the city, regarding it in times of sadness or nostalgia as his true home.<ref name=\"w13\"/> Ruiz persuaded the officials at the academy to allow his son to take an entrance exam for the advanced class. This process often took students a month, but Picasso completed it in a week, and the jury admitted him, at just 13. As a student, Picasso lacked discipline but made friendships that would affect him in later life. His father rented a small room for him close to home so he could work alone, yet he checked up on him numerous times a day, judging his drawings. The two argued frequently.<ref name=\"caval\"/>\\n\\nPicasso\\'s father and uncle decided to send the young artist to Madrid\\'s [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando]], the country\\'s foremost art school.<ref name=\"w13\"/> At age 16, Picasso set off for the first time on his own, but he disliked formal instruction and stopped attending classes soon after enrollment. Madrid held many other attractions. The [[Museo del Prado|Prado]] housed paintings by [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Francisco Goya]], and [[Francisco Zurbarán]]. Picasso especially admired the works of [[El Greco]]; elements such as his elongated limbs, arresting colours, and mystical visages are echoed in Picasso\\'s later work.<ref name=\"propos\"/>\\n\\n== Career ==\\n=== Before 1900 ===\\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1904, Paris, photograph by Ricard Canals i Llambí cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Picasso in 1904. Photograph by [[Ricard Canals]]]]\\nPicasso\\'s training under his father began before 1890. His progress can be traced in the collection of early works now held by the [[Museu Picasso]]<!--MUSEU is not a typo--> in [[Barcelona]], which provides one of the most comprehensive extant records of any major artist\\'s beginnings.<ref name=\"cirl6\"/> During 1893 the juvenile quality of his earliest work falls away, and by 1894 his career as a painter can be said to have begun.<ref name=\"cirl14\"/> The academic realism apparent in the works of the mid-1890s is well displayed in \\'\\'The First Communion\\'\\' (1896), a large composition that depicts his sister, Lola. In the same year, at the age of 14, he painted \\'\\'[https://www.wikiart.org/en/pablo-picasso/portrait-of-aunt-pepa-1896 Portrait of Aunt Pepa]\\'\\', a vigorous and dramatic portrait that [[Juan Eduardo Cirlot|Juan-Eduardo Cirlot]] has called \"without a doubt one of the greatest in the whole history of Spanish painting.\"<ref name=\"cirl37\"/>\\n\\nIn 1897, his realism began to show a [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] influence, for example, in a series of landscape paintings rendered in non-naturalistic violet and green tones. What some call his Modernist period (1899–1900) followed. His exposure to the work of [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti|Rossetti]], [[Théophile Steinlen|Steinlen]], [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]] and [[Edvard Munch]], combined with his admiration for favourite old masters such as [[El Greco]], led Picasso to a personal version of modernism in his works of this period.<ref name=\"cirl87\"/>\\n\\nPicasso made his first trip to [[Paris]], then the art capital of Europe, in 1900. There, he met his first Parisian friend, journalist and poet [[Max Jacob]], who helped Picasso learn the language and its literature. Soon they shared an apartment; Max slept at night while Picasso slept during the day and worked at night. These were times of severe poverty, cold, and desperation. Much of his work was burned to keep the small room warm. During the first five months of 1901, Picasso lived in [[Madrid]], where he and his [[anarchist]] friend Francisco de Asís Soler founded the magazine \\'\\'Arte Joven\\'\\' (\\'\\'Young Art\\'\\'), which published five issues. Soler solicited articles and Picasso illustrated the journal, mostly contributing grim cartoons depicting and sympathizing with the state of the poor. The first issue was published on 31 March 1901, by which time the artist had started to sign his work \\'\\'Picasso\\'\\'.<ref name=\"cirl125\"/> From 1898 he signed his works as \"Pablo Ruiz Picasso\", then as \"Pablo R. Picasso\" until 1901. The change does not seem to imply a rejection of the father figure. Rather, he wanted to distinguish himself from others; initiated by his Catalan friends who habitually called him by his maternal surname, much less current than the paternal Ruiz.<ref>Fermigier, André (1969). \\'\\'Picasso\\'\\', Le Livre de Poche, Série Art.

In his austere use of colour and sometimes doleful subject matter—prostitutes and beggars are frequent subjects—Picasso was influenced by a trip through Spain and by the suicide of his friend [[Carles Casagemas]]. Starting in autumn of 1901, he painted several posthumous portraits of Casagemas culminating in the gloomy allegorical painting \\'\\'La Vie\\'\\' (1903), now in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]].<ref name=\"watte\"/>\\n\\nThe same mood pervades the well-known etching \\'\\'The Frugal Repast\\'\\' (1904),<ref name=\"metmu\"/> which depicts a blind man and a sighted woman, both emaciated, seated at a nearly bare table. Blindness, a recurrent theme in Picasso\\'s works of this period, is also represented in \\'\\'The Blindman\\'s Meal\\'\\' (1903, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]) and in the portrait of \\'\\'Celestina\\'\\' (1903). Other Blue Period works include \\'\\'Portrait of Soler\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[Portrait of Suzanne Bloch]]\\'\\'.\\n\\n=== Rose Period: 1904–1906 ===\\n{{details|Picasso\\'s Rose Period}}\\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, 1905, Au Lapin Agile (At the Lapin Agile), oil on canvas, 99.1 x 100.3 cm, Metropolitan Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, 1905, \\'\\'Au Lapin Agile\\'\\' (\\'\\'At the Lapin Agile\\'\\') (\\'\\'Arlequin tenant un verre\\'\\'), oil on canvas, 99.1 × 100.3&nbsp;cm, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]]]\\n\\nThe Rose Period (1904–1906)<ref name=\"Watte194\"/> is characterized by a lighter tone and style utilizing orange and pink colours and featuring many circus people, [[Family of Acrobats (study)|acrobats]] and [[harlequin]]s known in France as saltimbanques. The harlequin, a comedic character usually depicted in checkered patterned clothing, became a personal symbol for Picasso. Picasso met [[Fernande Olivier]], a [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] artist who became his mistress, in Paris in 1904.<ref name=\"theatlantic.com\"/> Olivier appears in many of his Rose Period paintings, many of which are influenced by his warm relationship with her, in addition to his increased exposure to French painting. The generally upbeat and optimistic mood of paintings in this period is reminiscent of the 1899–1901 period (i.e., just prior to the Blue Period), and 1904 can be considered a transition year between the two periods.\\n\\n[[File:GertrudeStein.JPG|thumb|left|\\'\\'[[Portrait of Gertrude Stein]]\\'\\', 1906, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York City. When someone commented that Stein did not look like her portrait, Picasso replied, \"She will\".<ref name=\"metmu2\"/>]]\\n\\nBy 1905, Picasso became a favourite of American art collectors [[Leo Stein|Leo]] and [[Gertrude Stein]]. Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted a [[portrait of Gertrude Stein]] and one of her nephew [[Allan Stein]]. Gertrude Stein became Picasso\\'s principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal \\'\\'Salon\\'\\' at her home in Paris.<ref name=\"yale8\"/> At one of her gatherings in 1905, he met [[Henri Matisse]], who was to become a lifelong friend and rival. The Steins introduced him to [[Claribel Cone]] and her sister Etta, who were American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso\\'s and Matisse\\'s paintings. Eventually, Leo Stein moved to Italy. Michael and Sarah Stein became patrons of Matisse, while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picassos.<ref name=\"charm\"/>\\n\\nIn 1907, Picasso joined an art gallery that had recently been opened in Paris by [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], a German art historian and art collector who became one of the premier French art dealers of the 20th century. He was among the first champions of Pablo Picasso, [[Georges Braque]] and the [[Cubism]] that they jointly developed. Kahnweiler promoted burgeoning artists such as [[André Derain]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Juan Gris]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] and several others who had come from all over the globe to live and work in [[Montparnasse]] at the time.<ref name=\"tate7\"/>\\n\\n=== African art and primitivism: 1907–1909 ===\\n{{See also|Picasso\\'s African Period|Proto-Cubism}}\\n[[File:Les Demoiselles d\\'Avignon.jpg|thumb|right|\\'\\'[[Les Demoiselles d\\'Avignon]]\\'\\' (1907), [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York]]\\nPicasso\\'s African-influenced Period (1907–1909) begins with his painting \\'\\'[[Les Demoiselles d\\'Avignon]]\\'\\'. The three figures on the left were inspired by [[Iberian sculpture]], but he repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the ethnographic museum at [[Palais du Trocadéro]].<ref name=\"rube87\"/> When he displayed the painting to acquaintances in his studio later that year, the nearly universal reaction was shock and revulsion; Matisse angrily dismissed the work as a hoax.<ref name=\"pbsor\"/> Picasso did not exhibit \\'\\'Les Demoiselles\\'\\' publicly until 1916.\\n\\nOther works from this period include \\'\\'Nude with Raised Arms\\'\\' (1907) and \\'\\'Three Women\\'\\' (1908). Formal ideas developed during this period lead directly into the Cubist period that follows.<ref name=\"Watte207\"/>\\nAnalytic [[cubism]] (1909–1912) is a style of painting Picasso developed with [[Georges Braque]] using monochrome brownish and neutral colours. Both artists took apart objects and \"analyzed\" them in terms of their shapes. Picasso and Braque\\'s paintings at this time share many similarities.<ref name=\"retro123\"/>\\n\\nIn Paris, Picasso entertained a distinguished coterie of friends in the [[Montmartre]] and [[Montparnasse]] quarters, including [[André Breton]], poet [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], writer [[Alfred Jarry]] and [[Gertrude Stein]]. In 1911, Picasso was arrested and questioned about [[Mona Lisa#Refuge, theft, and vandalism|the theft of the \\'\\'Mona Lisa\\'\\']] from the [[Louvre]]. Suspicion for the crime had initially fallen upon Apollinaire due to his links to Géry Pieret, an artist with a history of thefts from the gallery. Apollinaire in turn implicated his close friend Picasso, who had also purchased stolen artworks from the artist in the past. Afraid of a conviction that could result in his deportation to Spain, Picasso denied having ever met Apollinaire. Both were later cleared of any involvement in the painting\\'s disappearance.<ref name=\"thief\"/><ref name=\"TIME - 08Apr2009 - Art\\'s Great Whodunit: The Mona Lisa Theft of 1911\"/>\\n\\n=== Synthetic cubism: 1912–1919 ===\\n{{main|Crystal Cubism}}\\n[[File:Pablo Picasso, summer 1912.jpg|thumb|upright|Picasso in front of his painting \\'\\'The Aficionado\\'\\' ([[Kunstmuseum Basel]]) at Villa les Clochettes, summer 1912]]\\nSynthetic cubism (1912–1919) was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut paper fragments&nbsp;– often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages&nbsp;– were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of [[collage]] in fine art.{{fact|date=August 2023}}\\n\\nBetween 1915 and 1917, Picasso began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. \"Hard-edged square-cut diamonds\", notes art historian [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]], \"these gems do not always have upside or downside\".<ref name=\"Richardson\"/><ref name=\"kahn18\"/> \"We need a new name to designate them,\" wrote Picasso to [[Gertrude Stein]]. The term \"[[Crystal Cubism]]\" was later used as a result of visual analogies with crystals at the time.<ref name=\"Green, 1987\" /><ref name=\"Richardson\" /><ref name=\"moran143\"/> These \"little gems\" may have been produced by Picasso in response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with classicism within the so-called [[return to order]] following the war.<ref name=\"Richardson\" /><ref name=\"Green, 1987\"/>\\n\\nAfter acquiring some fame and fortune, Picasso left Olivier for Marcelle Humbert, also known as [[Eva Gouel]]. Picasso included declarations of his love for Eva in many Cubist works. Picasso was devastated by her premature death from illness at the age of 30 in 1915.<ref name=\"primi\"/>\\n\\nAt the outbreak of [[World War I]] in August 1914, Picasso was living in [[Avignon]]. Braque and Derain were mobilized and Apollinaire joined the French artillery, while the Spaniard [[Juan Gris]] remained from the Cubist circle. During the war, Picasso was able to continue painting uninterrupted, unlike his French comrades. His paintings became more sombre and his life changed with dramatic consequences. Kahnweiler\\'s contract had terminated on his exile from France. At this point, Picasso\\'s work would be taken on by the art dealer [[Léonce Rosenberg]]. After the loss of Eva Gouel, Picasso had an affair with [[Gabrielle Lespinasse|Gaby Lespinasse]]. During the spring of 1916, Apollinaire returned from the front wounded. They renewed their friendship, but Picasso began to frequent new social circles.<ref name=\"moma92\"/>\\n\\n[[File:Costume design by Pablo Picasso representing skyscrapers and boulevards, for Serge Diaghilev\\'s Ballets Russes performance of Parade at Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris 18 May 1917.jpg|thumb|upright|Costume design by Pablo Picasso representing skyscrapers and boulevards, for [[Serge Diaghilev]]\\'s [[Ballets Russes]] performance of \\'\\'[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]\\'\\' at Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris 18 May 1917]]\\n\\n{{Further|Picasso and the Ballets Russes}}\\n\\nTowards the end of World War I, Picasso became involved with [[Serge Diaghilev]]\\'s [[Ballets Russes]]. Among his friends during this period were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Jean Hugo]], Juan Gris, and others. In the summer of 1918, Picasso married [[Olga Khokhlova]], a ballerina with Sergei Diaghilev\\'s troupe, for whom Picasso was designing a ballet, Erik Satie\\'s \\'\\'[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]\\'\\', in Rome; they spent their honeymoon near [[Biarritz]] in the villa of glamorous Chilean art patron [[Eugenia Errázuriz]].<ref name=\"retro198\"/>\\n\\nKhokhlova introduced Picasso to high society, formal dinner parties, and other dimensions of the life of the rich in 1920s Paris. The two had a son, Paulo Picasso,<ref name=\"xtime\"/> who would grow up to be a motorcycle racer and chauffeur to his father. Khokhlova\\'s insistence on social propriety clashed with Picasso\\'s [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] tendencies and the two lived in a state of constant conflict. During the same period that Picasso collaborated with Diaghilev\\'s troupe, he and [[Igor Stravinsky]] collaborated on \\'\\'[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]\\'\\' in 1920. Picasso took the opportunity to make several drawings of the composer.<ref name=\"cubis\"/>\\n\\nIn 1927, Picasso met 17-year-old [[Marie-Thérèse Walter]] and began a secret affair with her. Picasso\\'s marriage to Khokhlova soon ended in separation rather than divorce, as French law required an even division of property in the case of divorce, and Picasso did not want Khokhlova to have half his wealth. The two remained legally married until Khokhlova\\'s death in 1955. Picasso carried on a long-standing affair with Marie-Thérèse Walter and fathered a daughter with her, named Maya. Marie-Thérèse lived in the vain hope that Picasso would one day marry her, and hanged herself four years after Picasso\\'s death.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Huffington |first=Arianna |date=1 June 1988 |title=Picasso: Creator and Destroyer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1988/06/picasso-creator-and-destroyer/305715/ |access-date=22 September 2023 |website=The Atlantic |language=en}}</ref>\\n\\n<gallery widths=\"170\" heights=\"180\" class=\"center\">\\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1909, Femme assise (Sitzende Frau), oil on canvas, 100 x 80 cm, Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, Neue Nationalgalerie.jpg|1909, \\'\\'Femme assise (Sitzende Frau)\\'\\', oil on canvas, 100 × 80&nbsp;cm (39 × 31 in), [[Berlin State Museums|Staatliche Museen]], [[Neue Nationalgalerie]], Berlin\\nFile:Pablo Picasso, 1909-10, Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise), oil on canvas, 92.1 x 73 cm, Tate Modern, London.jpg|1909–10, \\'\\'Figure dans un Fauteuil (Seated Nude, Femme nue assise)\\'\\', oil on canvas, 92.1 × 73&nbsp;cm (36 × 28 in), [[Tate Modern]], London.

This \"[[return to order]]\" is evident in the work of many European artists in the 1920s, including [[André Derain]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Gino Severini]], [[Jean Metzinger]], the artists of the [[New Objectivity]] movement and of the [[Novecento Italiano]] movement. Picasso\\'s paintings and drawings from this period frequently recall the work of [[Raphael]] and [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cowling |first=Elizabeth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=INnpAAAAMAAJ |title=Picasso: Challenging the Past |date=2009 |publisher=National Gallery |isbn=978-1-85709-452-7 |page=70 |language=en}}</ref>\\n\\nIn 1925 the [[Surrealist]] writer and poet [[André Breton]] declared Picasso as \\'one of ours\\' in his article \\'\\'Le Surréalisme et la peinture\\'\\', published in \\'\\'Révolution surréaliste\\'\\'. \\'\\'Les Demoiselles\\'\\' was reproduced for the first time in Europe in the same issue. Yet Picasso exhibited Cubist works at the first Surrealist group exhibition in 1925; the concept of \\'psychic automatism in its pure state\\' defined in the \\'\\'Manifeste du surréalisme\\'\\' never appealed to him entirely. He did at the time develop new imagery and formal syntax for expressing himself emotionally, \"releasing the violence, the psychic fears and the eroticism that had been largely contained or sublimated since 1909\", writes art historian Melissa McQuillan. Although this transition in Picasso\\'s work was informed by Cubism for its spatial relations, \"the fusion of ritual and abandon in the imagery recalls the primitivism of the Demoiselles and the elusive psychological resonances of his Symbolist work\", writes McQuillan.

His use of the minotaur came partly from his contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol, and it appears in Picasso\\'s \\'\\'Guernica\\'\\'.

This large canvas embodies for many the inhumanity, brutality and hopelessness of war. Asked to explain its symbolism, Picasso said, \"It isn\\'t up to the painter to define the symbols.

After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, the painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. Until 1981 it was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was Picasso\\'s expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Guernica Introduction |url=https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/guernica/gmain.html |access-date=22 September 2023 |website=www.pbs.org}}</ref>\\n\\nBefore \\'\\'Guernica\\'\\', Picasso had never addressed political themes in his art.

Picasso\\'s artistic style did not fit the [[Nazi art|Nazi ideal of art]], so he did not exhibit during this time. He was often harassed by the [[Gestapo]].

Eventually, they had two children: [[Claude Picasso]], born in 1947 and [[Paloma Picasso]], born in 1949.

[[Jacqueline Roque]] (1927–1986) worked at the Madoura Pottery in [[Vallauris]] on the [[French Riviera]], where Picasso made and painted ceramics.

Devoting his full energies to his work, Picasso became more daring, his works more colourful and expressive, and from 1968 to 1971 he produced a torrent of paintings and hundreds of copperplate etchings.

This information was not revealed until 2003.<ref name=\"smhc5\"/>\\n\\nAt the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936, Picasso was 54 years of age.

During the final four years of his life, he moved between [[Kingdom of Naples|Naples]], [[Hospitaller Malta|Malta]], and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]] until his death. His paintings have been characterized by art critics as combining a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, which had a formative influence on [[Baroque painting]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Vincenzio Fanti|title=Descrizzione Completa di Tutto Ciò che Ritrovasi nella Galleria di Sua Altezza Giuseppe Wenceslao del S.R.I.

He made the technique a dominant stylistic element, transfixing subjects in bright shafts of light and darkening shadows. Caravaggio vividly expressed crucial moments and scenes, often featuring violent struggles, torture, and death. He worked rapidly with live models, preferring to forgo drawings and work directly onto the canvas. His inspiring effect on the new [[Baroque]] style that emerged from [[Mannerism]] was profound. His influence can be seen directly or indirectly in the work of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], and [[Rembrandt]]. Artists heavily under his influence were called the \"[[Caravaggisti]]\" (or \"Caravagesques\"), as well as tenebrists or \\'\\'tenebrosi\\'\\' (\"shadowists\").\\n\\nCaravaggio trained as a painter in [[Milan]] before moving to Rome when he was in his twenties. He developed a considerable name as an artist and as a violent, touchy and provocative man. He killed Ranuccio Tommasoni in a brawl, which led to a death sentence for murder and forced him to flee to Naples. There he again established himself as one of the most prominent Italian painters of his generation. He travelled to Malta and on to Sicily in 1607 and pursued a papal pardon for his sentence. In 1609, he returned to Naples, where he was involved in a violent clash; his face was disfigured, and rumours of his death circulated. Questions about his mental state arose from his erratic and bizarre behavior. He died in 1610 under uncertain circumstances while on his way from Naples to Rome.

More importantly, it attracted the patronage of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Francesco Maria del Monte]], one of the leading connoisseurs in Rome. For del Monte and his wealthy art-loving circle, Caravaggio executed a number of intimate chamber-pieces—\\'\\'[[The Musicians (Caravaggio)|The Musicians]]\\'\\', \\'\\'[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|The Lute Player]]\\'\\', a tipsy \\'\\'[[Bacchus (Caravaggio)|Bacchus]]\\'\\', and an allegorical but realistic \\'\\'[[Boy Bitten by a Lizard]]\\'\\'—featuring Minniti and other adolescent models.\\n[[File:Michelangelo Caravaggio 020.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|[[The Lute Player (Caravaggio)|\\'\\'The Lute Player\\'\\']] (Hermitage version), {{Circa|1600}}, [[Hermitage Museum]], Saint Petersburg (commissioned by [[Francesco Maria del Monte]])]]\\n\\nCaravaggio\\'s first paintings on religious themes returned to realism and the emergence of remarkable spirituality.

He preferred to paint his subjects as the eye sees them, with all their natural flaws and defects, instead of as idealised creations. This allowed a full display of his virtuosic talents. This shift from accepted standard practice and the classical idealism of [[Michelangelo]] was very controversial at the time. Caravaggio also dispensed with the lengthy preparations for a painting that were traditional in central Italy at the time. Instead, he preferred the Venetian practice of working in oils directly from the subject—half-length figures and still life. \\'\\'[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio, London)|Supper at Emmaus]]\\'\\', from {{Circa|1600–1601}}, is a characteristic work of this period demonstrating his virtuoso talent.\\n\\n=== \"Most famous painter in Rome\" (1600–1606) ===\\n\\nIn 1599, presumably through the influence of del Monte, Caravaggio was contracted to decorate the [[Contarelli Chapel]] in the church of [[San Luigi dei Francesi]]. The two works making up the commission, \\'\\'[[The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[The Calling of Saint Matthew]]\\'\\', delivered in 1600, were an immediate sensation.

Opinion among his artist peers was polarized. Some denounced him for various perceived failings, notably his insistence on painting from life, without drawings, but for the most part he was hailed as a great artistic visionary: \"The painters then in Rome were greatly taken by this novelty, and the young ones particularly gathered around him, praised him as the unique imitator of nature, and looked on his work as miracles.\"<ref>Bellori.

According to the [[Gospel of John]], [[Thomas the Apostle]] missed one of Jesus\\' appearances to the apostles after his resurrection and said, \"Unless I see the marks of the nails in his hands, and put my finger where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe it.\" A week later, Jesus appeared and told Thomas to touch him and stop doubting. Then Jesus said, \"Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\"\\n\\nBoth versions of the painting show in a demonstrative gesture how the doubting apostle puts his finger into Christ\\'s side wound, the latter guiding his hand.

Caravaggio\\'s contemporary [[Giulio Mancini]] records that it was rejected because Caravaggio had used a well-known prostitute as his model for the Virgin.<ref>Mancini: \"Thus one can understand how badly some modern artists paint, such as those who, wishing to portray the Virgin Our Lady, depict some dirty prostitute from the Ortaccio, as Michelangelo da Caravaggio did in the Death of the Virgin in that painting for the Madonna della Scala, which for that very reason those good fathers rejected it, and perhaps that poor man suffered so much trouble in his lifetime.\"</ref> [[Giovanni Baglione]], another contemporary, tells that it was due to Mary\\'s bare legs<ref>Baglione: \"For the [church of] Madonna della Scala in Trastevere he painted the death of the Madonna, but because he had portrayed the Madonna with little decorum, swollen and with bare legs, it was taken away, and the Duke of Mantua bought it and placed it in his most noble gallery.\"</ref>—a matter of decorum in either case. Caravaggio scholar John Gash suggests that the problem for the Carmelites may have been theological rather than aesthetic, in that Caravaggio\\'s version fails to assert the doctrine of the [[Assumption of Mary]], the idea that the Mother of God did not die in any ordinary sense but was assumed into Heaven.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kUE3AQAAIAAJ&q=Carmelites|first=John|last=Gash|title=Caravaggio|publisher=Chaucer Press|date=2004|isbn=1904449220|pages=17–18|access-date=11 July 2019}}</ref> The replacement altarpiece commissioned (from one of Caravaggio\\'s most able followers, [[Carlo Saraceni]]), showed the Virgin not dead, as Caravaggio had painted her, but seated and dying; and even this was rejected, and replaced with a work showing the Virgin not dying, but ascending into Heaven with choirs of angels. In any case, the rejection did not mean that Caravaggio or his paintings were out of favour. \\'\\'Death of the Virgin\\'\\' was no sooner taken out of the church than it was purchased by the Duke of Mantua, on the advice of [[Rubens]], and later acquired by [[Charles I of England]] before entering the French royal collection in 1671.\\n\\nOne secular piece from these years is \\'\\'[[Amor Vincit Omnia (Caravaggio)|Amor Vincit Omnia]]\\'\\', in English also called \\'\\'Amor Victorious\\'\\', painted in 1602 for [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], a member of del Monte\\'s circle.

He is possibly Francesco Boneri, identified with an artist active in the period 1610–1625 and known as [[Cecco del Caravaggio]] (\\'Caravaggio\\'s Cecco\\'),<ref>While Gianni Papi\\'s identification of Cecco del Caravaggio as Francesco Boneri is widely accepted, the evidence connecting Boneri to Caravaggio\\'s servant and model in the early 17th century is circumstantial.

He was also sued by a tavern waiter for having thrown a plate of [[artichoke]]s in his face.<ref>Calvesi 1986, p. 8.</ref>\\n\\nAn early published notice on Caravaggio, dating from 1604 and describing his lifestyle three years previously, recounts that \"after a fortnight\\'s work he will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him, from one ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument, so that it is most awkward to get along with him.\"<ref>Floris Claes van Dijk, a contemporary of Caravaggio in Rome in 1601, quoted in John Gash, \"Caravaggio\", p.&nbsp;13.

Ranuccio Tomassoni was a gangster from a wealthy family. The two had argued many times, often ending in blows. The circumstances are unclear, whether a brawl or a [[duel]] with swords at [[Campo Marzio]], but the killing may have been unintentional.\\n\\nMany rumors circulated at the time as to the cause of the fight.

People as quarrelsome as he were often to be found in his company: and having, in the end, confronted Ranuccio Tomassoni, a well-mannered young man, over some disagreement about a tennis match they challenged one another to a duel. After Ranuccio fell to the ground, Michelangelo struck him with the point of his sword and, having wounded him in the thigh, killed him.</ref> Other rumors, however, claimed that the duel stemmed from jealousy over [[Fillide Melandroni]], a well-known Roman prostitute who had modeled for him in several important paintings; Tomassoni was her pimp. According to such rumors, Caravaggio castrated Tomassoni with his sword before deliberately killing him, with other versions claiming that Tomassoni\\'s death had been caused accidentally during the castration. The duel may have had a political dimension, as Tomassoni\\'s family was notoriously pro-Spanish, whereas Caravaggio was a client of the French ambassador.\\n\\nCaravaggio\\'s patrons had hitherto been able to shield him from any serious consequences of his frequent duels and brawling, but Tomassoni\\'s wealthy family was outraged by his death and demanded justice. Caravaggio\\'s patrons were unable to protect him. Caravaggio was sentenced to [[beheading]] for murder, and an open bounty was decreed, enabling anyone who recognized him to carry out the sentence legally. Caravaggio\\'s paintings began, obsessively, to depict severed heads, often his own, at this time.\\n\\nGood modern accounts are to be found in [[Peter Robb (author)|Peter Robb]]\\'s \\'\\'[[M (Peter Robb book)|M]]\\'\\' and Helen Langdon\\'s \\'\\'Caravaggio: A Life\\'\\'.

In Naples, outside the jurisdiction of the Roman authorities and protected by the Colonna family, the most famous painter in Rome became the most famous in Naples.\\n[[File:Caravaggio - Sette opere di Misericordia.jpg|thumb|upright|\\'\\'[[The Seven Works of Mercy]]\\'\\', 1606–1607, [[Pio Monte della Misericordia]], Naples]]\\n\\nHis connections with the Colonnas led to a stream of important church commissions, including the \\'\\'[[Madonna of the Rosary (Caravaggio)|Madonna of the Rosary]]\\'\\', and \\'\\'[[The Seven Works of Mercy]]\\'\\'.<ref>Costanza\\'s brother Ascanio was Cardinal-Protector of the Kingdom of Naples; another brother, Marzio, was an advisor to the Spanish Viceroy; and a sister was married into the important Neapolitan Carafa family.

These connections are treated in most biographies and studies—see, for example, Catherine Puglisi, \"Caravaggio\", p.258, for a brief outline.

Caravaggio was expelled, not for his crime, but for having left Malta without permission (i.e., escaping).</ref>\\n\\n==== Sicily ====\\n\\n[[File:Room of caravaggio, regional museum od of messina.JPG|thumb|\\'\\'[[The Raising of Lazarus (Caravaggio)|The Raising of Lazarus]]\\'\\' and the \\'\\'[[Adoration of the Shepherds (Caravaggio)|Adoration of the Shepherds]]\\'\\', [[Regional Museum of Messina]], Sicily, Italy]]\\n\\nCaravaggio made his way to [[Sicily]] where he met his old friend Mario Minniti, who was now married and living in [[Syracuse, Italy|Syracuse]]. Together they set off on what amounted to a triumphal tour from Syracuse to [[Messina]] and, maybe, on to the island capital, [[Palermo]]. In Syracuse and Messina Caravaggio continued to win prestigious and well-paid commissions. Among other works from this period are \\'\\'[[Burial of St. Lucy (Caravaggio)|Burial of St. Lucy]]\\'\\', \\'\\'[[The Raising of Lazarus - Messina (Caravaggio)|The Raising of Lazarus]]\\'\\', and \\'\\'[[Adoration of the Shepherds (Caravaggio)|Adoration of the Shepherds]]\\'\\'. His style continued to evolve, showing now friezes of figures isolated against vast empty backgrounds. \"His great Sicilian altarpieces isolate their shadowy, pitifully poor figures in vast areas of darkness; they suggest the desperate fears and frailty of man, and at the same time convey, with a new yet desolate tenderness, the beauty of humility and of the meek, who shall inherit the earth.\"<ref>Langdon, p.365.</ref> Contemporary reports depict a man whose behaviour was becoming increasingly bizarre, which included sleeping fully armed and in his clothes, ripping up a painting at a slight word of criticism, and mocking local painters.\\n\\nCaravaggio displayed bizarre behaviour from very early in his career. Mancini describes him as \"extremely crazy\", a letter from Del Monte notes his strangeness, and Minniti\\'s 1724 biographer says that Mario left Caravaggio because of his behaviour. The strangeness seems to have increased after Malta. Susinno\\'s early-18th-century \\'\\'Le vite de\\' pittori Messinesi\\'\\' (\"Lives of the Painters of Messina\") provides several colourful anecdotes of Caravaggio\\'s erratic behaviour in Sicily, and these are reproduced in modern full-length biographies such as Langdon and Robb. Bellori writes of Caravaggio\\'s \"fear\" driving him from city to city across the island and finally, \"feeling that it was no longer safe to remain\", back to Naples. Baglione says Caravaggio was being \"chased by his enemy\", but like Bellori does not say who this enemy was.\\n\\n==== Return to Naples ====\\n\\n[[File:CaravaggioSalomeMadrid.jpg|thumb|left|\\'\\'[[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Caravaggio, Madrid)|Salome with the Head of John the Baptist]]\\'\\', [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]]]\\n\\nAfter only nine months in Sicily, Caravaggio returned to Naples in the late summer of 1609. According to his earliest biographer, he was being pursued by enemies while in Sicily and felt it safest to place himself under the protection of the Colonnas until he could secure his pardon from the pope (now [[Paul V]]) and return to Rome.<ref>Baglione says that Caravaggio in Naples had \"given up all hope of revenge\" against his unnamed enemy.</ref> In Naples he painted \\'\\'[[The Denial of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|The Denial of Saint Peter]]\\'\\', a final \\'\\'[[John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|John the Baptist (Borghese)]]\\'\\', and his last picture, \\'\\'[[The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Caravaggio)|The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]\\'\\'. His style continued to evolve—[[Saint Ursula]] is caught in a moment of highest action and drama, as the arrow fired by the king of the [[Huns]] strikes her in the breast, unlike earlier paintings that had all the immobility of the posed models. The brushwork was also much freer and more impressionistic.\\n\\n[[File:David with the Head of Goliath-Caravaggio (1610).jpg|thumb|upright|\\'\\'[[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio, Rome)|David with the Head of Goliath]]\\'\\', 1609–1610, [[Galleria Borghese]], Rome]]\\nIn October 1609, he was involved in a violent clash, an attempt on his life, perhaps ambushed by men in the pay of the knight he had wounded in Malta or some other faction of the Order. His face was seriously disfigured and rumours circulated in Rome that he was dead. He painted a \\'\\'[[Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid) (Caravaggio)|Salome with the Head of John the Baptist (Madrid)]]\\'\\', showing his own head on a platter, and sent it to Wignacourt as a plea for forgiveness. Perhaps at this time, he also painted a \\'\\'[[David with the Head of Goliath (Caravaggio, Rome)|David with the Head of Goliath]]\\'\\', showing the young David with a strangely sorrowful expression gazing at the severed head of the giant, which is again Caravaggio. This painting he may have sent to his patron, the unscrupulous art-loving Cardinal [[Scipione Borghese]], nephew of the pope, who had the power to grant or withhold pardons.<ref>According to a 17th-century writer, the painting of the head of Goliath is a self-portrait of the artist, while David is \\'\\'il suo Caravaggino\\'\\', \"his little Caravaggio\". This phrase is obscure, but it has been interpreted as meaning either that the boy is a youthful self-portrait or, more commonly, that this is the Cecco who modeled for the \\'\\'Amor Vincit\\'\\'. The sword-blade carries an abbreviated inscription that has been interpreted as meaning Humility Conquers Pride. Attributed to a date in Caravaggio\\'s late Roman period by Bellori, the recent tendency is to see it as a product of Caravaggio\\'s second Neapolitan period. (See Gash, p.125).</ref> Caravaggio hoped Borghese could mediate a pardon in exchange for works by the artist.\\n\\nNews from Rome encouraged Caravaggio, and in the summer of 1610, he took a boat northwards to receive the pardon, which seemed imminent thanks to his powerful Roman friends. With him were three last paintings, the gifts for Cardinal Scipione.<ref>A letter from the [[Bishop of Caserta]] in Naples to Cardinal Scipione Borghese in Rome, dated 29 July 1610, informs the Cardinal that the Marchesa of Caravaggio is holding two John the Baptists and a Magdalene that were intended for Borghese. These were presumably the price of Caravaggio\\'s pardon from Borghese\\'s uncle, the pope.</ref> What happened next is the subject of much confusion and conjecture, shrouded in much mystery.\\n\\nThe bare facts seem to be that on 28 July, an anonymous \\'\\'[[avviso]]\\'\\' (private newsletter) from Rome to the ducal court of Urbino reported that Caravaggio was dead. Three days later, another \\'\\'avviso\\'\\' said that he had died of fever on his way from Naples to Rome. A poet friend of the artist later gave 18 July as the date of death, and a recent researcher claims to have discovered a death notice showing that the artist died on that day of a fever in [[Porto Ercole]], near [[Grosseto]] in [[Tuscany]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Drancourt|first1=Michel|last2=Barbieri|first2=Rémi|last3=Cilli|first3=Elisabetta|last4=Gruppioni|first4=Giorgio|last5=Bazaj|first5=Alda|last6=Cornaglia|first6=Giuseppe|title=Did Caravaggio die of \\'\\'Staphylococcus aureus\\'\\' sepsis?|date=17 September 2018|journal=The Lancet|volume=18|issue=11|page=1178|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(18)30571-1|pmid=30236439|doi-access=free}}</ref>\\n\\n=== Death ===\\n\\nCaravaggio had a fever at the time of his death, and what killed him was a matter of controversy and rumour at the time and has been a matter of historical debate and study since.<ref name=geggel>{{cite web |url=https://www.livescience.com/63702-caravaggio-died-of-sepsis.html |title=Renaissance Master Caravaggio Didn\\'t Die of Syphilis, but of Sepsis |work=Live Science |author=Laura Geggel |date=28 September 2018 |access-date=30 September 2018}}</ref> Contemporary rumors held that either the Tomassoni family or the Knights had him killed in revenge.

Baglione accused Caravaggio and his friends of writing and distributing scurrilous doggerel attacking him; the pamphlets, according to Baglione\\'s friend and witness Mao Salini, had been distributed by a certain Giovanni Battista, a \\'\\'bardassa\\'\\', or boy prostitute, shared by Caravaggio and his friend Onorio Longhi. Caravaggio denied knowing any young boy of that name, and the allegation was not followed up.<ref>The transcript of the trial is given in Walter Friedlander, \"Caravaggio Studies\" (Princeton, 1955, revised edn. 1969)</ref>\\n\\nBaglione\\'s painting of \"Divine Love\" has also been seen as a visual accusation of [[sodomy]] against Caravaggio.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Such accusations were damaging and dangerous as sodomy was a capital crime at the time. Even though the authorities were unlikely to investigate such a well-connected person as Caravaggio, \"Once an artist had been smeared as a pederast, his work was smeared too.\"<ref name=\"Andrew Graham-Dixon 2011, p.4\"/> Francesco Susino in his later biography additionally relates the story of how the artist was chased by a schoolmaster in Sicily for spending too long gazing at the boys in his care. Susino presents it as a misunderstanding, but some authors have speculated that Caravaggio may indeed have been seeking sex with the boys, using the incident to explain some of his paintings which they believe to be homoerotic.<ref>Andrew Graham-Dixon, \\'\\'Caravaggio: A life sacred and profane\\'\\', Penguin, 2011, p.412</ref>\\n\\nThe art historian [[Andrew Graham-Dixon]] has summarised the debate:\\n<blockquote>A lot has been made of Caravaggio\\'s presumed homosexuality, which has in more than one previous account of his life been presented as the single key that explains everything, both the power of his art and the misfortunes of his life. There is no absolute proof of it, only strong circumstantial evidence and much rumour. The balance of probability suggests that Caravaggio did indeed have sexual relations with men. But he certainly had female lovers. Throughout the years that he spent in Rome, he kept close company with a number of prostitutes. The truth is that Caravaggio was as uneasy in his relationships as he was in most other aspects of life. He likely slept with men. He did sleep with women. He settled with no one... [but] the idea that he was an early martyr to the drives of an unconventional sexuality is an anachronistic fiction.<ref name=\"Andrew Graham-Dixon 2011, p.4\" /></blockquote>\\n\\n\\'\\'Washington Post\\'\\' art critic Philip Kennicott has taken issue with what he regarded as Graham-Dixon\\'s minimizing of Caravaggio\\'s homosexuality:\\n<blockquote>There was a fussiness to the tone whenever a scholar or curator was forced to grapple with transgressive sexuality, and you can still find it even in relatively recent histories, including Andrew Graham-Dixon\\'s 2010 biography of Caravaggio, which acknowledges only that \"he likely slept with men\".<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/lgbt-artists-sent-messages-from-the-closet-to-survive-before-stonewall-now-homophobes-coopting-the-technique/2019/06/20/96540414-8c8a-11e9-adf3-f70f78c156e8_story.html| title = \"LGBT artists sent messages from the closet to survive before Stonewall.

With this came the acute observation of physical and psychological reality that formed the ground both for his immense popularity and for his frequent problems with his religious commissions.\\n\\nHe worked at great speed, from live models, scoring basic guides directly onto the canvas with the end of the brush handle; very few of Caravaggio\\'s drawings appear to have survived, and it is likely that he preferred to work directly on the canvas, an unusual approach at the time. His models were basic to his realism; some have been identified, including [[Mario Minniti]] and [[Francesco Boneri]], both fellow artists, Minniti appearing as various figures in the early secular works, the young Boneri as a succession of angels, Baptists and Davids in the later canvasses. His female models include [[Portrait of a Courtesan (Caravaggio)|Fillide Melandroni]], [[Martha and Mary Magdalene (Caravaggio)|Anna Bianchini]], and Maddalena Antognetti (the \"Lena\" mentioned in court documents of the \"artichoke\" case<ref>Much of the documentary evidence for Caravaggio\\'s life in Rome comes from court records; the \"artichoke\" case refers to an occasion when the artist threw a dish of hot artichokes at a waiter.</ref> as Caravaggio\\'s concubine), all well-known prostitutes, who appear as female religious figures including the Virgin and various saints.<ref>Robb, \\'\\'passim\\'\\', makes a fairly exhaustive attempt to identify models and relate them to individual canvases.</ref> Caravaggio himself appears in several paintings, his final self-portrait being as the witness on the far right to the \\'\\'[[The Martyrdom of Saint Ursula (Caravaggio)|Martyrdom of Saint Ursula]]\\'\\'.<ref>Caravaggio\\'s self-portraits run from the \\'\\'Sick Bacchus\\'\\' at the beginning of his career to the head of Goliath in the \\'\\'David with the Head of Goliath\\'\\' in Rome\\'s Borghese Gallery.

In \\'\\'[[The Calling of St Matthew]]\\'\\', the hand of the Saint points to himself as if he were saying, \"who, me?\", while his eyes, fixed upon the figure of Christ, have already said, \"Yes, I will follow you\". With \\'\\'[[The Raising of Lazarus (Caravaggio)|The Resurrection of Lazarus]]\\'\\', he goes a step further, giving a glimpse of the actual physical process of resurrection. The body of Lazarus is still in the throes of [[rigor mortis]], but his hand, facing and recognising that of Christ, is alive. Other major [[Baroque]] artists would travel the same path, for example [[Bernini]], fascinated with themes from [[Ovid]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Metamorphoses]]\\'\\'.{{sfn|Thornhill|2015|p=Foreword}}\\n\\n=== The Caravaggisti ===\\n[[File:Crucifixion of Saint Peter-Caravaggio (c.1600).jpg|thumb|The \\'\\'[[Crucifixion of Saint Peter (Caravaggio)|Crucifixion of Saint Peter]]\\'\\', 1601, [[Cerasi Chapel]], [[Santa Maria del Popolo]], Rome]]\\n\\nThe installation of the St. Matthew paintings in the Contarelli Chapel had an immediate impact among the younger artists in Rome, and Caravaggism became the cutting edge for every ambitious young painter. The first Caravaggisti included [[Orazio Gentileschi]] and [[Giovanni Baglione]]. Baglione\\'s Caravaggio phase was short-lived; Caravaggio later accused him of plagiarism and the two were involved in a long feud. Baglione went on to write the first biography of Caravaggio. In the next generation of Caravaggisti, there were [[Carlo Saraceni]], [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]] and [[Orazio Borgianni]]. Gentileschi, despite being considerably older, was the only one of these artists to live much beyond 1620 and ended up as a court painter to [[Charles I of England]]. His daughter [[Artemisia Gentileschi]] was also stylistically close to Caravaggio and one of the most gifted of the movement. However, in Rome and Italy, it was not Caravaggio, but the influence of his rival [[Annibale Carracci]], blending elements from the [[High Renaissance]] and Lombard realism, that ultimately triumphed.\\n[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - Old Woman and Boy with Candles.jpg|thumb|left|\\'\\'Old Woman and Boy with Candles\\'\\' by [[Rubens]] ([[Mauritshuis]], The Hague)]]\\nCaravaggio\\'s brief stay in Naples produced a notable school of Neapolitan Caravaggisti, including [[Battistello Caracciolo]] and [[Carlo Sellitto]]. The Caravaggisti movement there ended with a terrible outbreak of plague in 1656, but the Spanish connection—Naples was a possession of Spain—was instrumental in forming the important Spanish branch of his influence.\\n\\n[[Rubens]] was likely one of the first Flemish artists to be influenced by Caravaggio whose work he got to know during his stay in Rome in 1601. He later painted a copy (or rather an interpretation) of Caravaggio\\'s \\'\\'[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|Entombment of Christ]]\\'\\' and recommended his patron, the [[Vincenzo I of Gonzaga|Duke of Mantua]], purchase [[Death of the Virgin (Caravaggio)|\\'\\'Death of the Virgin\\'\\']] ([[Louvre]]). Although some of this interest in Caravaggio is reflected in his drawings during his Italian residence, it was only after his return to Antwerp in 1608 that Rubens\\' works show openly Caravaggesque traits such as in the \\'\\'[[:File:Peter Paul Rubens - Cain slaying Abel, 1608-1609.jpg|Cain slaying Abel]]\\'\\' (1608–1609) ([[Courtauld Institute of Art]]) and the [[:File:Peter Paul Rubens - Old Woman and Boy with Candles.jpg|\\'\\'Old Woman and Boy with Candles\\'\\']] (1618–1619) ([[Mauritshuis]]). However, the influence of Caravaggio on Rubens\\' work would be less important than that of [[Raphael]], [[Correggio]], [[Barocci]] and the Venetians. Flemish artists, who were influenced by Rubens, such as [[Jacob Jordaens]], [[Pieter van Mol]], [[Gaspar de Crayer]] and [[Willem Jacob Herreyns]], also used certain stark realism and strong contrasts of light and shadow, common to the Caravaggesque style.<ref>Gregori, Mina, Luigi Salerno, and Richard E. Spear, \\'\\'The Age of Caravaggio\\'\\', Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1985</ref>\\n\\nA number of Catholic artists from [[Utrecht]], including [[Hendrick ter Brugghen]], [[Gerrit van Honthorst]] and [[Dirck van Baburen]] travelled in the first decades of the 17th century to Rome. Here they became profoundly influenced by the work of Caravaggio and his followers. On their return to Utrecht, their Caravaggesque works inspired a short-lived but influential flowering of artworks inspired indirectly in style and subject matter by the works of Caravaggio and the Italian followers of Caravaggio. This style of painting was later referred to as [[Utrecht Caravaggism]]. In the following generation of Dutch artists the effects of Caravaggio, although attenuated, are to be seen in the work of [[Vermeer]] and Rembrandt, neither of whom visited Italy.<ref name=rijk>[https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/rijksstudio/styles/caravaggism Caravaggism at the Rijksmuseum]</ref>\\n\\n=== Death and rebirth of a reputation ===\\n[[File:Caravaggio - La Deposizione di Cristo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|\\'\\'[[The Entombment of Christ (Caravaggio)|The Entombment of Christ]]\\'\\', (1602–1603), [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]], Rome]]\\n\\nCaravaggio\\'s innovations inspired the Baroque, but the Baroque took the drama of his chiaroscuro without the psychological realism.{{dubious|date=November 2022}} While he directly influenced the style of the artists mentioned above, and, at a distance, the Frenchmen [[Georges de La Tour]] and [[Simon Vouet]], and the Spaniard [[Giuseppe Ribera]], within a few decades his works were being ascribed to less scandalous artists, or simply overlooked. The Baroque, to which he contributed so much, had evolved, and fashions had changed, but perhaps more pertinently, Caravaggio never established a workshop as the Carracci did and thus had no school to spread his techniques. Nor did he ever set out his underlying philosophical approach to art, the psychological realism that may only be deduced from his surviving work.\\n\\nThus his reputation was doubly vulnerable to the unsympathetic critiques of his earliest biographers, [[Giovanni Baglione]], a rival painter with a vendetta, and the influential 17th-century critic [[Gian Pietro Bellori]], who had not known him but was under the influence of the earlier [[Giovanni Battista Agucchi]] and Bellori\\'s friend [[Poussin]], in preferring the \"classical-idealistic\" tradition of the [[Bolognese school (painting)|Bolognese school]] led by the Carracci.<ref>Wikkkower, p. 266; also see criticism by fellow Italian [[Vincenzo Carducci]] (living in Spain), who calls Caravaggio an \"Antichrist\" of painting with \"monstrous\" talents of deception.</ref> Baglione, his first biographer, played a considerable part in creating the legend of Caravaggio\\'s unstable and violent character, as well as his inability to draw.<ref>Ostrow, 608</ref>\\n\\nIn the 1920s, art critic [[Roberto Longhi]] brought Caravaggio\\'s name once more to the foreground and placed him in the European tradition: \"[[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]], [[Vermeer]], La Tour and Rembrandt could never have existed without him.

Such a complex disarray of figures was rare in Florentine art, where it would usually only be found in images showing either the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] or the Torments of Hell. The relief treatment, in which some of the figures are boldly projecting, may indicate Michelangelo\\'s familiarity with Roman [[sarcophagus]] reliefs from the collection of Lorenzo Medici, and similar marble panels created by [[Nicola Pisano|Nicola]] and [[Giovanni Pisano]], and with the figurative compositions on [[Ghiberti]]\\'s [[Florence Baptistery#Lorenzo Ghiberti|Baptistry Doors]].{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}\\n\\nThe composition of the \\'\\'Battle of Cascina\\'\\' is known in its entirety only from copies,<ref>Goldscheider, p. 8</ref> as the original cartoon, according to Vasari, was so admired that it deteriorated and was eventually in pieces.<ref name=Vasari/> It reflects the earlier relief in the energy and diversity of the figures,<ref>J. de Tolnay, \\'\\'The Youth of Michelangelo\\'\\', p. 135</ref> with many different postures, and many being viewed from the back, as they turn towards the approaching enemy and prepare for battle.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\\n\\nIn \\'\\'The Last Judgment\\'\\' it is said that Michelangelo drew [[Artistic inspiration|inspiration]] from a fresco by [[Melozzo da Forlì]] in Rome\\'s [[Santi Apostoli, Rome|Santi Apostoli]]. Melozzo had depicted figures from different angles, as if they were floating in the Heaven and seen from below. Melozzo\\'s majestic figure of Christ, with windblown cloak, demonstrates a degree of foreshortening of the figure that had also been employed by [[Andrea Mantegna]], but was not usual in the frescos of Florentine painters. In \\'\\'The Last Judgment\\'\\' Michelangelo had the opportunity to depict, on an unprecedented scale, figures in the action of either rising heavenward or falling and being dragged down.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}\\n\\nIn the two frescos of the Pauline Chapel, \\'\\'The Crucifixion of St. Peter\\'\\' and \\'\\'The Conversion of Saul\\'\\', Michelangelo has used the various groups of figures to convey a complex narrative. In the \\'\\'Crucifixion of Peter\\'\\' soldiers busy themselves about their assigned duty of digging a post hole and raising the cross while various people look on and discuss the events. A group of horrified women cluster in the foreground, while another group of Christians is led by a tall man to witness the events.

At the same church, Giulio de\\' Medici (later Pope Clement VII) commissioned him to design the Medici Chapel and the tombs of Giuliano and Lorenzo Medici.<ref>Goldscheider</ref> Pope Clement also commissioned the Laurentian Library, for which Michelangelo also designed the extraordinary vestibule with columns recessed into niches, and a staircase that appears to spill out of the library like a flow of lava, according to [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], \"...&nbsp;revealing [[Mannerism]] in its most sublime [[architectural form]].\"<ref>Nikolaus Pevsner, \\'\\'An Outline of European Architecture\\'\\', Pelican, 1964</ref>\\n\\nIn 1546 Michelangelo produced the highly complex ovoid design for the pavement of the [[Campidoglio]] and began designing an upper storey for the [[Farnese Palace]]. In 1547 he took on the job of completing St Peter\\'s Basilica, begun to a design by Bramante, and with several intermediate designs by several architects. Michelangelo returned to Bramante\\'s design, retaining the basic form and concepts by simplifying and strengthening the design to create a more dynamic and unified whole.<ref name=\"Gardner\">Gardner</ref> Although the late 16th-century engraving depicts the dome as having a hemispherical profile, the dome of Michelangelo\\'s model is somewhat ovoid and the final product, as completed by [[Giacomo della Porta]], is more so.<ref name=\"Gardner\"/>\\n\\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\" perrow=\"4\">\\nFile:Laurentian Library vestibule.jpg|The vestibule of the [[Laurentian Library]] has [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] features which challenge the Classical order of Brunelleschi\\'s adjacent church.\\nFile:View of the Campidoglio as re-designed by Michelangelo from the \\'Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae\\' MET DP844272.jpg|Michelangelo\\'s redesign of the ancient [[Capitoline Hill]] included a complex spiralling pavement with a star at its centre.\\nFile:L’Architecture de la Renaissance - Fig. 13.PNG|Michelangelo\\'s design for St Peter\\'s is both massive and contained, with the corners between the [[apse|apsidal]] arms of the Greek Cross filled by square projections.\\nFile:Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae- Elevation Showing the Exterior of Saint Peter\\'s Basilica from the South as Conceived by Michelagelo (Published in 1569) MET DT203424.jpg|The exterior is surrounded by a [[giant order]] of pilasters supporting a continuous cornice.

They are heralded by the \\'\\'[[The Genius of Victory|Victory]]\\'\\', perhaps created for the tomb of Pope Julius II but left unfinished. In this group, the youthful victor overcomes an older hooded figure, with the features of Michelangelo.\\n\\nThe \\'\\'Pietà of Vittoria Colonna\\'\\' is a chalk drawing of a type described as \"presentation drawings\", as they might be given as a gift by an artist, and were not necessarily studies towards a painted work. In this image, Mary\\'s upraised arms and hands are indicative of her prophetic role. The frontal aspect is reminiscent of [[Masaccio]]\\'s fresco of the [[Holy Trinity]] in the [[Basilica of Santa Maria Novella]], Florence.\\n\\nIn the \\'\\'Florentine Pietà\\'\\', Michelangelo again depicts himself, this time as the aged [[Nicodemus]] lowering the body of Jesus from the cross into the arms of Mary his mother and Mary Magdalene. Michelangelo smashed the left arm and leg of the figure of Jesus. His pupil [[Tiberio Calcagni]] repaired the arm and drilled a hole in which to fix a replacement leg which was not subsequently attached. He also worked on the figure of Mary Magdalene.<ref>Maiorino, Giancarlo, 1990. \\'\\'[https://books.google.com/books?id=Raf5I8SLQhQC&pg=PA28 The Cornucopian Mind and the Baroque Unity of the Arts]\\'\\'.

Although their names are often cited together, Michelangelo was younger than Leonardo by 23 years, and older than Raphael by eight. Because of his reclusive nature, he had little to do with either artist and outlived both of them by more than forty years.{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}} Michelangelo took few sculpture students. He employed [[Francesco Granacci]], who was his fellow pupil at the Medici Academy, and became one of several assistants on the Sistine Chapel ceiling.<ref name=Goldscheider12/> Michelangelo appears to have used assistants mainly for the more manual tasks of preparing surfaces and grinding colours. Despite this, his works were to have a great influence on painters, sculptors and architects for many generations to come.\\n\\nWhile Michelangelo\\'s \\'\\'David\\'\\' is the most famous male nude of all time, and copies of it now grace cities around the world, some of his other works have had perhaps even greater impact on the course of art. The twisting forms and tensions of the \\'\\'Victory\\'\\', the \\'\\'Bruges Madonna\\'\\' and the \\'\\'Medici Madonna\\'\\' make them the heralds of the [[Mannerism|Mannerist art]]. The unfinished giants for the tomb of Pope Julius II had profound effect on late-19th- and 20th-century sculptors such as [[Rodin]] and [[Henry Moore]].\\n\\nMichelangelo\\'s vestibule of the Laurentian Library was one of the earliest buildings to use classical forms in a plastic and expressive manner. This dynamic quality was later to find its major expression in his centrally planned St. Peter\\'s, with its [[giant order]], its rippling cornice and its upward-launching pointed dome. The dome of St. Peter\\'s was to influence the building of churches for many centuries, including [[Sant\\'Andrea della Valle]] in Rome and [[St Paul\\'s Cathedral]], London, as well as the civic domes of many public buildings and the state capitals across America.\\n\\nArtists who were directly influenced by Michelangelo include Raphael, whose monumental treatment of the figure in the \\'\\'[[School of Athens]]\\'\\' and \\'\\'[[The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple]]\\'\\' owes much to Michelangelo, and whose fresco of \\'\\'[[The Prophet Isaiah (Raphael)|Isaiah]]\\'\\' in Sant\\'Agostino closely imitates the older master\\'s prophets.<ref>Ettlinger, Leopold David, and Helen S.
