She was often described as a [[country music|country]] singer, although, like [[Skeeter Davis]] (to whom she has been frequently compared),{{cn|date=July 2024}} her output varied. Later in her career, the term \"countrypolitan\", associated with the \"[[Nashville sound]]\", was sometimes applied.<ref name=\"darcy\">Michael D'Arcy [http://www.countrypolitan.com/fringe0601.php Countrypolitan] www.countrypolitan.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203191740/http://www.countrypolitan.com/fringe0601.php |date=February 3, 2007}}</ref> Posey had four hit singles in the [[United States]], three of which peaked at number 12 on the [[Hot 100]].<ref name=\":0\">Charlie Gillett & Simon Frith (1976) ''Rock File 4''</ref>\n\n==Early life and session singer career==\nPosey was born in [[Jasper, Alabama]], on June 18, 1944.<ref name=\":1\">Posey\u2019s birth name has sometimes been cited mistakenly as Martha Sharp because Sharp wrote some of her early recordings: see, for example, Hugh Gregory (1993), ''Who's Who In Country Music''.</ref><ref>Some sources give 1947, but 1944 is more consistent with her having graduated from high school in 1962 and Posey herself has referred to her age as 21 at the time that \"Born a Woman\" was made in 1966: see sleeve notes for Sandy Posey's CD ''A Single Girl: The Very Best of the MGM Recordings'' (2002), which contains an extensive interview with Posey about her early career.</ref> She graduated from [[high school]] in [[West Memphis, Arkansas]], in 1962.<ref name=\":2\">See sleeve notes for ''A Single Girl'' (2002)</ref> Posey obtained work as a session singer after being recommended by an aunt to an acquaintance who worked in [[television]].\n\nIn addition to working as a [[receptionist]] at a studio in Memphis, she took part in recording sessions across the [[Deep South]], including sessions produced by [[Chips Moman|Lincoln \"Chips\" Moman]] for [[Elvis Presley]] and on [[Percy Sledge]]\u2019s \"[[When a Man Loves a Woman (song)|When a Man Loves a Woman]]\" (a number one hit in the US in 1966). Other singers whom she backed included [[Joe Tex]], [[Bobby Goldsboro]] and [[Tommy Roe]].{{cn|date=July 2024}}\n\n==Solo career==\nPosey's first single, under the name '''Sandy Carmel''', was \"Kiss Me Goodnight\" (1965), written by William Cates, which was coupled with \"First Boy\". This was released by [[Bell Records (1950s-70s)|Bell Records]] but received minimal publicity and made little impact.

The song was later covered by [[Nick Lowe]] ([[Bowi (EP)|Bowi]] EP) and [[Hubble Bubble]]. The song was later used by [[Rush Limbaugh]] for his \u201cFeminist Update\u201d.\n\n===\"Single Girl\"===\nPosey's next single release was \"[[Single Girl]]\", also written by Martha Sharp. Recorded in Nashville on August 19, 1966,<ref name=\"mgm\" /> this also reached number 12 in America in January 1967 and number 15 in [[Great Britain]], where it benefited from airplay on [[pirate radio]] (peaking, for example, at number 7 in [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]]'s non-sales-based Fab 40 on [[New Year's Day]], 1967<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolondon.co.uk/xmas01/xfabs01/jan01/xfabforty010167.html |title=Field's Fab New Year - 1st January 1967 |publisher=Radio London |date=January 1, 1967 |access-date=August 19, 2015}}</ref>).

These were mostly produced by Moman, but a few, including a version of [[The Shirelles]]' hit \"[[Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow]]\" (1968), were produced by [[Joe South]].\n\n===Country recordings===\nPosey turned to the country music field in 1971, signing with [[Columbia Records]] with [[Billy Sherrill]] as producer. Sherrill had just successfully turned another 1960s pop star, [[Jody Miller]], into a leading country female vocalist, and it appeared Posey might be another one when the first single, \"Bring Him Safely Home to Me\" hit the top 20. However, it was not to be, with only two other singles barely scraping into the top 40. Posey signed with [[Monument Records]] in 1976 with just one single charting and later in the year moved to [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Her first single for the label inauspiciously peaked at No.&nbsp;93, but in 1978 and 1979 she charted three top&nbsp;30 country hits before this brief comeback faded away with the new decade.\n\nPosey was occasionally recorded as a solo artist in the early 1980s, but she reverted to occasional background session work and later briefly performed as a background vocalist for [[Skeeter Davis]] on an international tour. She made a number of country recordings with a religious theme after embracing [[Christianity]] in 1974.<ref name=\"darcy\" /><ref>sleeve notes for ''A Single Girl'' CD, 2002</ref>\n\nIn 1983, Posey had another charted single on the country charts, titled \"Can't Get Used to Sleeping Without You\". In 2004, Posey recorded an album for King Records in Nashville, Tennessee. She subsequently signed with Crossworlds Entertainment of Lebanon, Tennessee. During 2007, Posey released several songs through Crossworlds Entertainment.{{cn|date=July 2024}}\n\n==Personal life and death==\nOn February 4, 1969, Posey married James \"Billy\" Buchanan Robinson Jr. The couple had one daughter, but they later divorced. Posey then married Elvis impersonator and Christian evangelist, \"Elvis\" Wade Cummins.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Posey died from complications of dementia at her home

Dove and his first wife, Catherine Pearl n\u00e9e Smith Dove Rusk, was born in [[Herndon, Virginia]], United States, his older sister is Marjorie L. Forrester.  During his stint in the Coast Guard, Dove began his singing career in the clubs of [[Baltimore]], where he was stationed. He formed a group, The Belltones, and they played Baltimore and the East Coast for four years. In 1959, they recorded their debut single \"Lover Boy\" on their own label.  In 1961, they released a cover of the [[Buddy Knox]] hit \"[[Party Doll]]\" on [[Decca Records]], but it failed to chart. They issued one more single on Jalo Records before the group broke up and Dove went solo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/31288|title=Ronnie Dove And The Beltones - Party Doll|website=45cat.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHe went solo and signed with [[Diamond Records]] in 1964. His first solo single, \"Sweeter Than Sugar\" appeared in April 1964 to no national fanfare, though it did appear in some local hit parades.  Later that year, Diamond released \"[[Say You (Ronnie Dove song)|Say You]]\" which peaked at position #40 by means of the Billboard hit parade, and became his first national hit parade success. The next single, a cover of [[Wanda Jackson]]'s \"[[Right or Wrong (Wanda Jackson song)|Right Or Wrong]],\" put him into the Top 20.  In 1965, he had 5 chart singles and after just three albums [[Diamond Records]] released a \"best of\" collection.  His name was featured many times in both ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' awards in 1965.\n\nMore hits came in 1966 and 1967 including \"My Babe\", \u201c[[Cry (Churchill Kohlman song)|Cry]]\u201d, \"[[Happy Summer Days]]\" and several others.\nAfter releasing his cover of [[Johnnie Ray]]\u2019s song \u201cCry\u201d, Ronnie appeared on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]] to sing the song.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0724859/|title=\"The Ed Sullivan Show\" Connie Francis, Flip Wilson, Henny Youngman, Stiller & Meara (TV Episode 1967) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> He continued to record for Diamond until it was sold in 1970 to [[Aubrey Mayhew]]'s Certron Records.  There, he recorded a live album and several singles that went unreleased. However, Certron did issue a \u201cGreatest Hits\u201d compilation of his Diamond songs, as well as one unreleased song.  The label had money issues from the start and went bankrupt in 1971.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/nyc/diamond/diamond.html|title=Diamond Album Discography|website=Bsnpubs.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, he went to the independent Wrayco Records and released a [[Bobby Hebb]] cover of the song \"[[Sunny (Bobby Hebb song)|Sunny]]\u201d.  The single received no promotion from the label and subsequently failed to chart.\n\n===Country music===\nAfter his stints with Certron and Wrayco, he signed a new deal with [[Decca Records]] in 1971 and pointed his career in a more country oriented direction, scoring two minor country chart hits and an album. Later, he moved to the [[Motown]] country label Melodyland and had a top 40 country hit with a cover of [[Bobby Darin]]\u2019s \"[[Things (Bobby Darin song)|Things]]\", which would become his highest charting country hit, reaching #25.  During this period, he recorded two albums of country music, but neither ended up being released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/motown/mc/mc.html|title=M.C. Album Discography|website=Bsnpubs.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>  Although he moved to some smaller, independent labels throughout the rest of the 1970\u2019s and 1980\u2019s, he still continued to record.  Dove opened his own club in Baltimore, and his fans were able to see him perform through the 1980s.  He briefly revived the Diamond record label in 1987 to release a couple of singles and an album.  These two singles managed to reach the lower rungs of Billboard's Country charts.\n\n==Later career==\nDove quit show business in 1989 to care for his ailing mother.  She died in 1991, and Dove resumed performing.  Dove continued to perform, mostly on the East Coast, and nationwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ronniedove.com/index-24.html|title=Ronnie Dove/ Biography|website=Ronniedove.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> There have been several compilations issued on CD, including ''The Complete Original Chart Hits: 1964-69'', available from Real Gone Music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.realgonemusic.com/news/2014/5/14/ronnie-dove.html|title=Real Gone Music - News - Ronnie Dove|website=Realgonemusic.com|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref>  Dove owns the rights to his music catalog.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ronniedovemusic.com/contact.html|title = Contact Ronnie Dove Music}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Ronnie Dove Music reissued his 1967 album ''[[Cry (Ronnie Dove album)|Cry]]'' album digitally, sourced from newly available tapes.

She rose to fame after winning the [[American Idol (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'' in 2002, which earned her a record deal with [[RCA Records]]. Her debut single, \"[[A Moment Like This]]\", topped the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and became the country's best-selling single of 2002.

In his career, he has recorded ten studio albums and eight singles. Two of his singles were hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and six more on the [[Hot Country Songs]] chart. His ninth chart entry came in late 2008-early 2009 as a guest vocalist on [[Kenny Chesney]]'s cover of his 1990 single \"[[Down the Road (Mac McAnally song)|Down the Road]]\".\n\nIn addition to his work as a solo artist, McAnally has written number-one singles for [[Alabama (band)|Alabama]] and [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]], as well as songs for [[Sawyer Brown]] and [[T.G. Sheppard]] among others. He also holds a number of credits as a [[session musician]], and has [[record producer|produced]] for Sawyer Brown, [[Restless Heart]], and [[Jimmy Buffett]]. McAnally was also a longtime member of Buffett's backing band, [[the Coral Reefer Band]], until Buffett's death in 2023.\n\n==Biography==\n=== Early life and career ===\nLyman Corbitt McAnally Jr. was born in [[Red Bay, Alabama]]. As a child, he began playing piano and singing in church at the Belmont First Baptist Church in [[Belmont, Mississippi]], and by age fifteen, he had composed his first song.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> From there, he went on to become a session musician in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]]. During a session break, McAnally began to perform original material. The producers there encouraged him, and by 1977 he was signed to [[Ariola Records]]. His self-titled debut album produced the single \"It's a Crazy World\" which reached No.&nbsp;37 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Reviewing it in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] said, \"although it does often sound pat, as folk [[stoicism]] will in a [[post-folk]] context, the first side comes across pretty outspoken for a Mississippi singer-songwriter with royalties in the bank\u2014the heroine of one song is a rape victim who murders both assailant and judge after the latter lets off the former.

These latter two albums produced no chart singles. However, he found success as a songwriter for [[Jimmy Buffett]], in addition to co-writing [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]]'s Number One hit \"[[Old Flame (Alabama song)|Old Flame]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\nMcAnally continued to record even while writing for Buffett.  Mac eventually signed with Geffen Records with two albums (''Nothin' but the Truth'', which included the single \"Minimum Love\" which reached No.&nbsp;41 on the Billboard Hot 100, and ''Finish Lines'') being issued in 1983 and 1988, respectively. He and [[Walt Aldridge]] co-wrote [[Ricky Van Shelton]]'s 1987 single \"[[Crime of Passion (Ricky Van Shelton song)|Crime of Passion]]\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>\n\n===1990s and 2000s===\n{{Expand section|Critical reception, awards & nominations, session work|date=June 2010}}\nIn 1990, McAnally signed to [[Warner Bros.

This album produced his first Top 40 country hit in the No.&nbsp;14 \"[[Back Where I Come From]].\" [[Kenny Chesney]] would also record McAnally's \"Back Where I Come From\" for his 1996 album ''[[Me and You (Kenny Chesney album)|Me and You]]''. Also in 1990, [[Steve Wariner]] released a McAnally co-write, the Top Ten hit \"[[Precious Thing]].\"<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The only other single from ''Simple Life'' was the No.&nbsp;70 \"[[Down the Road (Mac McAnally song)|Down the Road]]\", and by year's end, he exited Warner Bros.' roster.\n\nMcAnally's seventh studio album, ''Live and Learn'', followed in 1992, producing three low-charting singles. Also that year, he produced [[Sawyer Brown]]'s album ''[[The Dirt Road]]'', and continued to produce almost all of their subsequent albums, in addition to co-writing several of the band's singles between then and the late 1990s, including the Number One \"[[Thank God for You]]\", as well as the Top Five hits \"[[All These Years]]\", \"Cafe on the Corner\", \"The Boys and Me\", and \"This Time\". His second and final release for MCA, 1994's ''Knots'', failed to produce any chart singles, although [[Linda Davis]] charted that year with \"Company Time\", which he wrote. Throughout the 1990s, McAnally also found work as a session musician, playing guitar on several artists' albums, in addition to joining Buffett's road band.\n\nIt was not until 1999, when he signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] Nashville, that McAnally released his next album.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> This album, ''Word of Mouth'', also failed to produce any singles. Another album, ''Semi-True Stories'', followed in 2004 on [[Mailboat Records]], the same label to which Buffett is signed. Also in 2004, McAnally and [[Kyle Lehning]] produced [[Restless Heart]]'s reunion album ''[[Still Restless]]'', which included covers of three McAnally songs. In 2008, McAnally was awarded Musician of the Year by the [[Country Music Association]]. Also in 2008, he participated in the production of the album ''Psalngs'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://press.psalngs.com/ Press.Psalngs.com|title=Press for Psalngs.com|work=Press.Psalngs.com|access-date=August 28, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825021755/http://press.psalngs.com/|archive-date=August 25, 2011}}</ref> the debut release of Canadian musician [[John Lefebvre]].\n\n[[Kenny Chesney]] covered McAnally's 1990 single \"Down the Road\" on his 2008 album ''[[Lucky Old Sun]]'', as a duet with McAnally.

In February 2009, it became his first Number One as a singer. One month later, McAnally signed to [[Show Dog Nashville]], a label owned by [[Toby Keith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughstock.com/blog/mac-mcanally-signs-with-show-dog-records|title=Mac McAnally Signs with Show Dog Records|last=Bjorke|first=Matt|date=March 1, 2009|work=Roughstock|access-date=March 27, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318044907/http://www.roughstock.com/blog/mac-mcanally-signs-with-show-dog-records|archive-date=March 18, 2009}}</ref> His first single release for the label is \"You First\".

He performed [[jazz]], [[Pop music|pop]], [[rock and roll]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Swing music|swing]], and [[country music]].\n\nDarin started his career as a songwriter for [[Connie Francis]]. In 1958, Darin co-wrote and recorded his first million-selling single, \"[[Splish Splash (song)|Splish Splash]]\", which was followed by Darin's own song \"[[Dream Lover]]\", then his covers of \"[[Mack the Knife#Popular song|Mack the Knife]]\" and \"[[Beyond the Sea (song)|Beyond the Sea]]\", which brought him worldwide fame. In 1962, Darin won a [[Golden Globe Award]] for his first film, ''[[Come September]]'', co-starring his first wife, actress [[Sandra Dee]].\n\nDuring the 1960s, Darin became more politically active and worked on [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s Democratic presidential campaign. He was present at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles at the time of [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy's assassination]] in June 1968. That same year, Darin discovered the woman who had raised him was his grandmother, not his mother as he thought, and learned that the woman he thought was his sister was actually his mother.

Darin subsequently made television guest appearances and remained a top draw.<ref name=\"Las Vegas\">{{cite web | url=http://www.bobbydarin.net/bdlasvegas.html | title=Bobby in Las Vegas 1960's and 1970's | access-date=October 13, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"Sandra Dee\">{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114698,00.html|date=March 18, 1991|access-date=August 16, 2012|volume=35|number=10|first=Sandra|last=Dee|title=Learning to Live Again: A Former Teen Queen Shakes Free of Her Humiliating Past to End Years of Self-Hate and Loneliness|journal=People Magazine|archive-date=September 19, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180919051139/https://people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114698,00.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Style and influence ==\nDarin was on par with [[Dean Martin]] and [[Frank Sinatra]].

On occasion, Presley would sneak into Darin's concerts and watch him perform.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn his short life, Darin explored all genres of music, such as pop, jazz, country, and folk music. In a 1988 Rolling Stone interview, [[Neil Young]] confessed: \"I used to be pissed off at Bobby Darin because he changed styles so much.

They were soon in what Darin's friends described as, \"an intense romance\". However, Francis's parents did not approve of Darin and one night after returning from a date, Francis found her bags packed and waiting for her on the front step. Darin proposed almost immediately. When her father found out about the engagement, he stormed into the rehearsals of ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]'' with a gun and threatened to shoot Darin, who managed to escape out of a window. Darin and Francis talked briefly after the show, but parted ways.<ref name=\":2\" /> Over a four-month period in 1956, the two maintained a secret correspondence involving love letters. Darin kept the letters until his death, and the letters were auctioned. They were returned to Francis later in life.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nolasco |first=Stephanie |date=2018-02-08 |title=Connie Francis reflects on her romance with Bobby Darin before his untimely death |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/connie-francis-reflects-on-her-romance-with-bobby-darin-before-his-untimely-death |access-date=2024-05-14 |website=Fox News |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nIn the following years, they saw each other several times while appearing on the same television shows but were never romantically involved again. In 1960, Francis heard on the radio that Darin had married Sandra Dee &mdash; just as she and her father were driving through the [[Lincoln Tunnel]]. Francis later wrote: \"I wished that somehow God would cause the Hudson River to come gushing in and entrap us in that tunnel.\" Francis has said that not marrying Darin was the biggest mistake of her life.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Marriages ===\nDarin married actress [[Sandra Dee]] on December 1, 1960.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=December 2, 1960 |title=Darin, Sandra Dee Married, Fly Here |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/161225834/ |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=2 \u2013 Part I |access-date=December 28, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription}}</ref> They met in [[Rome]], [[Italy]], while filming ''Come September'' (which was released in 1961).<ref>{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Earl |author-link=Earl Wilson (columnist) |date=December 6, 1960 |title=Never Thought We'd See a Humble Bobby Darin |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/118369054/ |newspaper=The Arizona Republic |page=33 |location=Phoenix, Arizona |access-date=December 28, 2016 |via=Newspapers.com |url-access=subscription}}</ref> It was Dee's mother, Mary Douvon, who convinced the actress to go on a date with Darin.

Darin was frail as an infant and, beginning at age eight, had recurring bouts of [[rheumatic fever]] that left him with a seriously weakened heart.<ref name=\"Sandra Dee\"/> Darin was well aware that he might not live long, and lived his life accordingly.\n\nDuring his first [[heart surgery]] in January 1971, Darin had two [[artificial heart valve|artificial valves]] implanted, then spent most of that year recovering from the surgery.{{citation needed|date=June 2022}} In the last few years of his life, Darin was often administered oxygen during and after his performances on stage and screen.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Death==\nIn 1973, after failing to take antibiotics to protect his heart before a dental visit, Darin developed [[sepsis]], an overwhelming systemic infection, which further weakened his body and affected one of his heart valves. On December 11 of that year, Darin checked himself into [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center|Cedars of Lebanon Hospital]] in Los Angeles for another round of open-heart surgery to repair the two artificial heart valves he had received in January 1971.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> On the evening of December 19, a four-person surgical team worked for over six hours to repair Darin's damaged heart. Shortly after the surgery ended in the early morning hours of December 20, Darin died in the recovery room without regaining consciousness. He was only 37 years old.<ref name=ergmtkf/><ref name=\"NYT-Obit\" />\n\nDarin's last wish in his will was that his body be donated to science for [[medical research]], and Darin's remains were transferred to the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center|UCLA Medical Center]] shortly after his death.<ref name=\"NYT-Obit\" />\n\n==Legacy==\nIn 1990, Darin was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], with singer and close friend [[Paul Anka]] announcing the honor.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/bobby-darin/ |title=Bobby Darin: inducted in 1990 &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum | publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=August 17, 2015}}</ref> In 1999, Darin was voted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].\n\nSongwriter [[Alan O'Day]] alluded to Darin and his recording of \"Mack the Knife\" in the song \"[[Rock and Roll Heaven]]\" (made a hit by [[the Righteous Brothers]]), a tribute to dead musicians, which O'Day wrote shortly after Darin's death.\n\nOn May 14, 2007, Darin was awarded a star on the [[Las Vegas Walk of Stars]] to honor his contribution to making Las Vegas the \"Entertainment Capital of the World\" and named him one of the twentieth century's greatest entertainers. Fans paid for the star. Darin also has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].\n\nOn December 13, 2009, at its 2010 [[Grammy Awards]] ceremony, the Recording Academy awarded Darin a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\n===Biopic===\n{{Main|Beyond the Sea (2004 film)}}\nIn 1986, director [[Barry Levinson]] intended to direct a film based on Darin's life and had begun [[preproduction]] on the project by early 1997. He abandoned the project, the rights to which were subsequently bought by actor [[Kevin Spacey]], along with Darin's son, Dodd. The resultant biopic, ''[[Beyond the Sea (2004 film)|Beyond the Sea]]'', starred Spacey as Darin, with the actor using his own singing voice for the musical numbers. The film covers much of Darin's life and career, including his marriage to [[Sandra Dee]], portrayed by [[Kate Bosworth]].\n\n''Beyond the Sea'' opened at the 2004 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. Although Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee, and Blauner responded enthusiastically to Spacey's work and the film was strongly promoted by the studio, ''Beyond the Sea'' received mixed-to-poor reviews upon wide release, and box office results were disappointing. Spacey, however, was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award]] for Best Actor\u2014Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, but the award that year went to [[Jamie Foxx]] for his portrayal of Darin's musical contemporary [[Ray Charles]].\n\n===Musical===\nIn September 2016, ''[[Dream Lover: The Bobby Darin Musical]]'' had its world premiere at [[Sydney Lyric]] Theatre, Australia. The production featured the story of Darin with an 18-piece big band.

However, she decided to share her experience because she believed that everyone should \"speak their voice if they can and feel comfortable doing so\".

In early 1966 she had a [[Atlantic Ocean|transatlantic]] number-one hit with \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin{{'\"}}. A TV promo clip from the era features Sinatra in high boots, accompanied by colorfully dressed [[Go-go dancing|go-go dancers]], in what is now considered an iconic [[Swinging Sixties]] look.<ref name=KLSmith/><ref name=SLeigh/> The song was written by [[Lee Hazlewood]], who wrote and produced most of her hits and sang with her on several duets.

In addition to \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin{{'\"}}, defining recordings during this period include \"[[Sugar Town]]\", \"Love Eyes\", the transatlantic 1967 number one \"[[Somethin' Stupid]]\" (a duet with her father), two versions of [[You Only Live Twice (song)|the title song]] from the [[James Bond]] film ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' (1967), several collaborations with Lee Hazlewood \u2013 including \"[[Summer Wine]]\", \"[[Jackson (song)|Jackson]]\", \"Lady Bird\" and \"[[Some Velvet Morning]]\" \u2013 and a non-single 1966 cover of the [[Cher]] hit \"[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]\", which features in the opening credits of [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s 2003 film ''[[Kill Bill Volume 1]]''. In 1971 Sinatra and Hazlewood achieved their first collaborative success in the [[UK]] singles chart with the no. 2 hit \"Did You Ever?\", and the 2005 UK no. 3 hit by [[Audio Bullys]], \"[[Shot You Down]]\", sampled Sinatra's version of \"Bang Bang\".\n\nBetween 1964 and 1968 Sinatra appeared in several feature films, co-starring with [[Peter Fonda]] in [[Roger Corman]]'s biker-gang movie ''[[The Wild Angels]]'' (1966) and alongside [[Elvis Presley]] in the musical drama ''[[Speedway (1968 film)|Speedway]]'' (1968).

Boone eventually signed a consent order in which he promised not only to stop appearing in the ads, but also to pay about 2.5% of any money that the FTC or the courts might eventually order the manufacturer to refund to consumers.

She has two brothers, Robert and Alex, and three sisters, Marilyn, Anessa, and Morag. Her earliest-known public performance as a singer was in 1964 at the age of five, when she sang \"[[Early One Morning]]\" for her uncle and aunt and various relatives at the couple's 25th wedding anniversary celebration.<ref name=\"Official website\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sheenaeaston.com|title=Sheena Easton \u2013 The Official Website|work=sheenaeaston.com}}</ref>\n\nEaston's father died in 1969 and her mother had to support the family. According to Easton's website, despite her mother's heavy workload she was always available for her children: \"Sheena always speaks very highly of her mum and the wonderful job she did in bringing up her and her siblings, including teaching them all to read at home before they were even enrolled in school.\"<ref name=\"Official website\"/>\n\nEaston did not consider a singing career until she saw the movie ''[[The Way We Were]]'', with [[Barbra Streisand]]. Streisand's singing over the opening credits \"overtook\" the young girl and convinced her that what she wanted most was to be a singer and to have the same effect on others.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.iheart.com/artist/sheena-easton-30505/ | title=Sheena Easton }}</ref>\n\nHer top grades in school earned her a scholarship to attend the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] in [[Glasgow]], where she trained from 1975 to 1979 as a speech and drama teacher by day, while singing with a band called \"Something Else\" by night at local clubs.<ref name=\"Official website\"/> She chose to study teaching rather than performing, because it was a course of study that would let her perfect her craft as a singer.<ref name=\"Official website\"/>\n\nIn 1979, she married Sandi Easton, the first of her four husbands. They divorced after eight months, and Sheena decided to keep the surname Easton. That year, one of her tutors coaxed her into auditioning for [[Esther Rantzen]], producer of the BBC programme ''[[The Big Time (TV series)|The Big Time]]''. Rantzen was planning a documentary film to chronicle a relative unknown's rise to pop-music stardom. Easton was selected as the subject for the programme; [[EMI]] executives awarded her a contract, and [[Christopher Neil]] was assigned as her recording producer. [[Deke Arlon]] became her first manager, and Easton spent much of 1980 being followed by camera crews, who filmed her throughout the process of her audition through to making her first EMI single, \"Modern Girl\". In the course of the filming, she met and sang for [[Dorothy Squires]], [[Dusty Springfield]] and [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], whose manager [[Marion Massey]] told her that she saw Easton as a potential TV star with her own series, but not as a pop singer for the 1980s as she lacked \"rugged individuality\".\n\nThe encounter with Massey (then Marion London), at which Lulu was present, was filmed and included in the broadcast, at which time Massey was not entirely incorrect, as \"Modern Girl\" had flopped on its release, peaking at number 56 in just three weeks on the UK Singles Chart in April 1980.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/18351/sheena-easton/|title=Sheena Easton &#124; full Official Chart History |website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=27 March 2022}}</ref> However, once the programme aired in August 1980, \"Modern Girl\" was reissued and the track and its follow up \"Nine to Five\" both leapt into the top 10, disproving Massey's prediction. In a revised and extended version of this episode of ''The Big Time'', broadcast in 1981; this special concluded with news of Easton's breaking into the American market.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cWnf4yyvjM|title=Sheena Easton \u2013 The Big Time|last=Sheenaeaston Vids1|date=24 August 2017|access-date=23 November 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>\n\n===1981\u20131982: ''Take My Time'' and James Bond===\n{{main|Take My Time|You Could Have Been with Me|Madness, Money & Music}}\n{{see|For Your Eyes Only (song)}}\n\nEaston's first single, the [[disco]]-tinged soft-synth-pop tune, \"[[Modern Girl (Sheena Easton song)|Modern Girl]]\", was released in the UK before [[The Big Time (TV series)|''The Big Time'']] aired, reaching number 56. At the end of the show, Easton was still unsure of her future as a singer. The question was resolved soon after the show aired, when her second single, \"[[9 to 5 (Sheena Easton song)|9 to 5]]\", reached number 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and was certified a Gold single in 1980. \"Modern Girl\" re-entered the chart subsequently and climbed into the top 10, being certified a Silver single, and Easton found herself with two songs in the UK top 10 simultaneously.\n\n\"9 to 5\" was Easton's first single release in the United States, although it was renamed \"Morning Train (Nine To Five)\" for its release in the US and Canada to avoid confusion with [[Dolly Parton]]'s hit movie title song \"[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]\". \"Morning Train (Nine to Five)\" became Easton's first and only number 1 hit in the US and topped both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts in [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine. \"Modern Girl\" was released as the follow-up and peaked at number 18, and before 1981 was over she had a Top 10 hit in both the US and UK with the Academy Award-nominated [[James Bond]] movie theme \"[[For Your Eyes Only (song)|For Your Eyes Only]]\".

Her performance in Los Angeles was videotaped and broadcast on [[HBO]] and later released on VHS and Laserdisc as ''Sheena Easton Live at the Palace, Hollywood''.

The recording also earned her a number 1 single on the Country chart, and it reached the UK Top 30. Around the time of her hit record with Rogers, Easton headlined ''Act One'', a one-hour variety special broadcast on [[NBC]] that featured Rogers and a cameo appearance by [[Johnny Carson]]. October 1983 saw the release of the album'' [[Best Kept Secret (Sheena Easton album)|Best Kept Secret]]'' and its first single, the synthesized [[dance-pop]] tune \"[[Telefone (Long Distance Love Affair)]]\", became her fourth Top 10 hit.

It also became a hit on the Country charts for [[Lila McCann]] in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nIn 1984, Easton recorded a Spanish-language single, \"Me Gustas Tal Como Eres\" (\"I Like You Just the Way You Are\"), a duet with Mexican star [[Luis Miguel]]. The single earned her a second Grammy, this time for Best Mexican-American Performance. The track was taken from the album ''[[Todo Me Recuerda a Ti]]'' (1984), and reissued by Capitol/EMI-Latin in 1989, which featured Spanish-language covers of seven previous Easton recordings and three new tracks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In the same year, she also made a transformation into a sexy dance-pop siren, changing her performance style in the process. She was rewarded with the biggest-selling US album of her career, RIAA certified gold & platinum ''[[A Private Heaven]]'' (1984), and her sixth Top 10 US single, \"[[Strut (Sheena Easton song)|Strut]]\". In the UK, however, the move was not a commercial success, as Easton would find herself shut out of the UK top 75 for the next three years.\n\nHer career was increasing, particularly in the US, where Easton was again nominated for a Grammy Award, this time for \"Best Female Pop Vocal Performance\" in 1984.<ref name=\":1\"/> She was also one of the first artists to have a music video banned because of its lyrics rather than its imagery; some broadcasters refused to air the sexually risqu\u00e9 \"[[Sugar Walls]]\",{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} which had been written for her by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] (using the [[pseudonym]] ''Alexander Nevermind''). \"Sugar Walls\" was named by [[Tipper Gore]] of the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] as one of the \"Filthy Fifteen\", a list of songs deemed indecent because of their lyrics, alongside Prince's own \"[[Darling Nikki]]\".{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The song eventually hit number 3 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B singles chart]], number 9 on the Billboard Hot 100, and number 1 on the Billboard Dance Chart in 1985.\n\nEaston's follow-up to ''A Private Heaven'', entitled ''[[Do You (album)|Do You]]'' (1985), was produced by [[Nile Rodgers]] and achieved gold status, although it failed to generate any breakout singles of the chart calibre of \"Strut\" or \"Sugar Walls\".

During her time collaborating with Prince, Easton was encouraged to write her own material. The most successful effort from their co-writes was \"The Arms of Orion\", another duet with Prince and a single from 1989's [[Batman (album)|Batman soundtrack]]. The song reached number 36 on the US Billboard Chart and number 27 in her native UK. She also co-wrote the song \"Love '89\" with Prince for Patti LaBelle's album ''[[Be Yourself (Patti LaBelle album)|Be Yourself]]'' and \"La, La, La, He, He, Hee\", which [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] recorded for the B-side of the single \"[[Sign o' the Times (song)|Sign o' the Times]]\".

Sonny and Caitlin ended up married by the end of the episode, the first of five episodes for Easton. By the spring of 1988, a volume of the ''Miami Vice'' soundtrack was released and featured \"Follow My Rainbow\", which Easton had finished singing on her last appearance just moments before her character was eliminated.\n\nThe song also appeared on her next album ''[[The Lover in Me (album)|The Lover in Me]]'' (1988), RIAA gold-disc debut released the following autumn on her new label [[MCA Records]], that put Easton back on the US and UK charts after the release of ''No Sound But a Heart'' was cancelled in the US. This album features Urban [[R&B]] and Dance-pop, and a sexier image.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} The [[The Lover in Me (song)|title song]] from ''The Lover in Me'' reached number 2 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and UK number 15 and became her biggest pop hit since \"Morning Train\". It also became a number 5 hit on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles and Tracks]] chart. It was followed on the US R&B chart by \"Days Like This\" (number 35), which missed the Billboard Hot 100.

Her new American accent was booed by the crowd and she had bottles (some containing urine) thrown at her. Visibly shaken, she was forced to cut her set short. She vowed never to perform in Scotland again.<ref>{{cite web|title=How a generation of stars bombed in Glasgow's notorious comics graveyard|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/editors-choice/2008/12/12/how-a-generation-of-stars-bombed-in-glasgow-s-notorious-comics-graveyard-86908-20964184/|date=12 August 2008|publisher=Daily Record|access-date=2011-07-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Brian |title=Deacon Blue reveal they were terrified of following Sheena Easton on stage at their biggest ever gig |url=https://www.scotsman.com/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/deacon-blue-reveal-they-were-terrified-of-following-sheena-easton-on-stage-3453511 |website=scotsman.com |access-date=28 June 2024}}</ref>\n\n=== 1991\u20131996: ''What Comes Naturally'' and decline===\n{{main|What Comes Naturally|No Strings (album)|My Cherie}}\n\nIn 1991, ''[[What Comes Naturally]]'' became the last of Easton's albums to chart in the United States, peaking at number 90. The title song was also her last Top 40 single to date, reaching number 19. It also became her first hit in Australia since the mid-1980s, peaking at number 4.<ref>The Book Top 40 Research 8th Edition</ref> Two other singles, \"You Can Swing It\" and \"To Anyone,\" followed but failed to chart. \"What Comes Naturally\" remained on the US pop chart for 10 weeks and 11 weeks on the ARIA Chart in Australia. Easton has songwriting credits on three tracks. She is also one of the few pop artists to adopt the [[new jack swing]] sound with chart success from the early 1990s.\n\nIn 1992, an unofficial recording of \"Modern Girl\" (Live in San Diego) was released by \"That's Life\" recordings in Germany and Japan. The music was from her early output with EMI and became a sort of bootleg version of her concert when she performed stateside on her first worldwide tour in 1982. Easton followed this with the non-charting but critically acclaimed ''[[No Strings (album)|No Strings]]'' (1993), an album of jazz standards produced by [[Patrice Rushen]]. It included her version of \"[[The Nearness of You]],\" which was also featured on the soundtrack of the film, ''[[Indecent Proposal]],'' in which Easton appeared in a cameo role. ''[[My Cherie]]'' (1995) was her last pop album to date to see domestic release in the United States. The album saw Sheena reunite with producer [[Christopher Neil]] for the first time in over a decade.\n\n=== 1996\u20131999: ''Freedom'' and Colors of Christmas Tour ===\n{{main|Freedom (Sheena Easton album)|Home (Sheena Easton album)}}\n\nEaston contributed vocals to the soundtrack of ''[[All Dogs Go to Heaven 2]]'' and voiced the character Sasha La Fleur on \"Count Me Out\" and \"I Will Always Be With You\". Easton also performed \"Now and Forever\" with [[Barry Manilow]] for ''[[The Pebble and the Penguin]]'' soundtrack in 1995. She contributed the theme song \"Are There Angels\" to the soundtrack for ''[[Shiloh (film)|Shiloh]]'' in 1996; and provided the song \"A Dream Worth Keeping\" for the 1992 [[animated film]] ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]''. In 1997, she played 'Melissa McCammon', a recording star, who is visited by time travellers from the future in a second-season episode of the Canadian television series ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'' entitled \"[[Falling Star (The Outer Limits)|Falling Star]]\". The episode featured her singing two songs from ''[[My Cherie]]''.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Easton retained an album contract with [[MCA Records|MCA]] Japan and released two discs of new material. However, neither album was originally released in the United States. [[Freedom (Sheena Easton album)|''Freedom'']], released in 1997 to coincide with the launch of her website and finally released in (Limited Edition) stateside in 2007, was a return to her trademark pop, including a remake of her debut single \"[[Modern Girl (Sheena Easton song)|Modern Girl]]\". In 1999, [[Universal Records|Universal]]/[[Victor Records|Victor]] released the self-produced acoustic set, [[Home (Sheena Easton album)|''Home'']]. Also, around this time, Sheena Easton [[Greatest Hits]] collection featuring 12 MCA singles recorded from 1988 to 1995 released and charted in Japan at number 98 (additional greatest hits collections surfaced in the US and UK but did not chart).\n\nEaston adopted a boy (Jake) and girl (Skylar) between 1995 and 1996. Motherhood led her to curtail her appearances and focus on casino gigs, corporate shows and theatrical work.<ref name=\"CorArizona\">Cordova, Randy. \"[http://www.azcentral.com/ent/music/articles/2008/04/03/20080403easton.html 4/13: Sheena Easton at Phx Pride Festival].\" ''[[The Arizona Republic]]''. 3 April 2008.</ref> \"Because I adopted my children, I could plan my timing\", she told ''[[The Arizona Republic]]''. \"I knew exactly when they were coming along, so I knew when I had to change my life so it would be a stable life.\"<ref name=\"CorArizona\"/> Easton continued acting in America, starring in lead [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] revivals of ''[[Man of La Mancha]]'' as (Aldonza) opposite [[Raul Julia]] in his last stage role (1992), and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]'' as [[Betty Rizzo|Rizzo]] (1996). Between 1994 and 1996, she played several characters in ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'' the animated series, including Lady Finella, the Banshee, Molly and Robyn Canmore. In 1999, she voice-acted a part-demon character, Annah-of-the-Shadows, in the computer game ''[[Planescape: Torment]]''. She lives in [[Las Vegas]] with her two children and often performs in various casinos' entertainment venues. She voiced the character of Fiona Canmore for a scripted but unfinished episode of the cancelled animated feature, ''[[Team Atlantis]]''.\n\nIn December 1998, Easton toured with the American production \"The Colors of Christmas\" with artists [[Roberta Flack]], [[Melissa Manchester]], [[Peabo Bryson]] and [[Jeffrey Osborne]]. [[Windham Hill]] Records produced \"The Colors of Christmas\" disc by Robbie Buchanan of holiday music. Easton contributed two tracks, \"The Place Where We Belong\" (a duet with Jeffrey Osborne) and \"The Lord's Prayer\".\n\n===1999\u20132013: ''Fabulous'' and re-issues===\n{{main|Fabulous (album)}}\n[[File:SheenaEastonLiveA2009.jpg|thumb|right|Easton performing live in 2009]]\n\nIn 1999 New York\u2013based [[One Way Records]] reserved the rights to release all of Easton's EMI-America catalogue. For the first time in the US, ''No Sound But a Heart'' was released, 12 years after the album was made available elsewhere. All of Easton's EMI back catalogue (with another exception of her Spanish-language album ''Todo Me Recuerda a Ti'') was re-released and remastered with bonus tracks, incorporating B-sides and remixes. Universal Japan released ''Best Ballads'', a disc of ballads from her six previous albums from her MCA catalogue with the exception of \"For Your Eyes Only\" for the Japanese market that failed to chart.\n\nShe also signed an album contract with [[Universal Music Group|Universal International]] UK and attempted a comeback with ''[[Fabulous (album)|Fabulous]]'' (2000), an album of classic disco covers.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/0F6E176F02D856B8?p=UKNB|title=Pop Music: Interview Sheena Easton \u2013 Sheena Is A Disco Diva: Although No Longer A Huge Star in Britain, Singer Scottish-born Sheena Easton Has Remained Successful in Her Adopted Home of the Usa And Is Set for a Comeback on the Dancefloor|date=2 December 2000|work=The Birmingham Post|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref> The first single, \"Giving Up, Giving In\", reached UK number 54, and the album charted at UK number 185. A second single, a cover of Donna Summer's hit \"Love is in Control\", with double A-side \"[[Don't Leave Me This Way]]\", was withdrawn. This was to be Easton's last album release to date. The album was released throughout Europe, Japan, Australia, and Argentina but not in the US. In Australia, \"Fabulous\" was released 24 February 2001 and Easton was asked to perform songs from the album to close out 2001 [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]] ceremonies.\n\nIn 2003, Easton contributed vocals to \"If You're Happy\", a cover for a Japanese disc called ''Cover Morning Musume-Hello Project''. She also began to host ''Vegas Live'', a talk show with [[Clint Holmes]] (later replaced by [[Brian McKnight]]). In 2004, she was inducted into the Casino Legends Hall of Fame at the Tropicana Resort & Casino.\n\n===2013\u2013present: \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" and ''42nd Street''===\n\nIn February 2013, Demon/Edsel Records, based in the United Kingdom, reissued Easton's ''You Could Have Been with Me'' and ''Madness, Money & Music'' along with ''A Private Heaven'' and ''Do You'' in two compact disc packages remastered with bonus tracks, with the latter including the extended version of \"[[Jimmy Mack]]\" that has never been included on any of her reissues. In November 2014, a box set of Easton's first five albums in an original album series CD collection was released by [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]] in the United Kingdom. In 2015, Easton embarked on symphony concerts with guest vocalists entitled \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" with material from spy movies of the past and present and featuring [[James Bond|Bond]]-style music with symphonies around the United States beginning in San Francisco from July 2015 and continuing into 2016. Easton also performed a small tour of dates during the latter part of 2015 in Australia featuring her Greatest Hits.\n\nIn November 2016, Easton accepted the role of Dorothy Brock in the revival production of ''42nd Street'', which premiered on 20 March 2017 in London's West End, Drury Lane.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lloyd Weber|first=Imogen|title=She's in the Money!

He received the [[National Academy of Songwriters]] Lifetime Achievement Award in 1993, the Songwriters Hall of Fame Johnny Mercer Award in 2003, the ASCAP \"Voice of Music\" Award in 2006 and the [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Special International Award]] in 2012. According to [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], his song \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" was the third most performed song in the 50 years between 1940 and 1990.<ref name=\"songwriters-bio\"/> Webb is the only artist ever to receive [[Grammy Award]]s for music, lyrics and orchestration.<ref name=\"songwriters-bio\"/>\n\n==Early life==\nWebb was born on August 15, 1946, in [[Elk City, Oklahoma]], and raised in [[Laverne, Oklahoma]]. He grew up in a religiously conservative family;<ref name=\"ohs\"/> His father, Robert Lee Webb, was a [[Baptist]] minister and veteran of the [[United States Marine Corps]] who presided over rural churches in southwestern Oklahoma and west Texas. With his mother's encouragement, Webb learned piano and organ and by the age of 12 was playing in the choir of his father's churches, accompanied by his father on guitar and his mother on accordion.<ref name=\"allmusic-bio\"/>  His father restricted radio listening to country music and white gospel.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bourgoin |first1=Suzanne |title=Contemporary Musicians: Profiles of the People in Music |date=1994 |publisher=Gale Research, Incorporated |isbn=978-0-8103-8553-5 |page=270 |language=en |quote=My father always controlled the radio very empirically and it was always either country music or white gospel ...}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1950s, Webb began applying his creativity to the music he was playing at his father's church, frequently improvising and rearranging the hymns.<ref name=\"allmusic-bio\"/> He began to write religious songs at this time,<ref name=\"allmusic-bio\"/> but his musical direction was soon influenced by the new music being played on the radio, including the music of [[Elvis Presley]]. In 1961, at the age of 14, he bought his first record, \"[[Turn Around, Look at Me]]\", by Glen Campbell. Webb said he was drawn to the singer's distinctive voice and they became friends a few years later.<ref name=\"shane\"/>\n\nIn 1964, Webb and his family moved to Southern California, where he attended [[San Bernardino Valley College]], studying music. During this time, he lived in [[Colton, California|Colton]], with his family. Following the death of his mother, Sylvia, in 1964, his father made plans to return to Oklahoma. Webb decided to stay in California to continue his music studies and to pursue a career as a songwriter in Los Angeles. He would later recall his father warning him about his musical aspirations, saying that \"This songwriting thing is going to break your heart.\" Seeing that his son was determined, however, he gave him $40, saying \"It's not much, but it's all I have.\"<ref name=\"shane\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===Early success, 1965\u20131969===\nAfter transcribing other people's music for a small music publisher in Hollywood, Webb was signed to a songwriting contract with Jobete Music, the publishing arm of [[Motown Records]]. The first commercial recording of a Jimmy Webb song was \"My Christmas Tree\" by [[The Supremes]], which appeared on their 1965 ''[[Merry Christmas (Supremes album)|Merry Christmas]]'' album. The following year, Webb met singer and producer [[Johnny Rivers]], who signed him to a publishing deal and recorded his song \"[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]\" on his 1966 album ''Changes''.<ref name=\"unofficial\"/> \n\nIn 1967, Rivers released ''Rewind'', an album featuring seven Webb songs, including \"[[Do What You Gotta Do (Jimmy Webb song)|Do What You Gotta Do]]\" and \"Tunesmith\", a song also recorded that year by [[Vikki Carr]] for her album ''It Must Be Him''.<ref name=\"unofficial\"/> That same year, Rivers turned to Webb for material for a new group Rivers was producing called [[the 5th Dimension]]. Webb contributed five songs to their debut album, ''[[Up, Up and Away (The 5th Dimension album)|Up, Up and Away]]'', including the title track, which was released as a single in May 1967 and reached the Top Ten. The group's follow-up album, ''[[The Magic Garden]]'', was also released in 1967 and featured eleven additional Webb songs, including \"[[Worst That Could Happen]]\".<ref name=\"unofficial\"/>\n\nIn November 1967, Glen Campbell released his version of \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\", which reached number 26. At the 1968 [[Grammy Awards]], \"Up, Up and Away\" was named Record of the Year (1967) and Song of the Year (1967). \"Up, Up and Away\" and \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" received eight Grammy Awards between them. \n\nIn 1968, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' acknowledged Webb's range, proficiency, and \"gift for strong, varied rhythms, inventive structures, and rich, sometimes surprising harmonies\".<ref name=\"songwriters-bio\"/> That year, the string of successful Webb songs continued with the 5th Dimension's \"Paper Cup\" and \"Carpet Man\" reaching the Top 40, Glen Campbell's \"[[Wichita Lineman]]\" selling over a million copies, and [[Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge]] scoring a gold record with \"Worst That Could Happen\", a song originally recorded by the 5th Dimension. \n\nWebb formed his own production and publishing company that year, Canopy, and scored a hit with its first project, an unlikely album with Irish actor [[Richard Harris]] singing an album of all Webb songs. One of the songs, \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\", was a long, complex piece with multiple movements<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/nov/11/how-we-made-macarthur-park|title=How we made MacArthur Park|date=November 11, 2013|website=the Guardian}}</ref> that was originally rejected by the group [[the Association]]. Despite the song's seven minutes and twenty-one seconds length, Harris's version reached No. 2 on the Hot 100 on June 22, 1968, and No. 4 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on July 24.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Singles Chart Top 50: 24 July 1968 |url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/19680724/7501/ |website=Official Charts Company |access-date=July 21, 2022}}</ref> The album, ''[[A Tramp Shining]]'', stayed on the charts for almost a year. Webb and Harris produced a follow-up album, ''[[The Yard Went On Forever]]'', which was also successful.  \n\nFurther raising Webb's stature as a songwriter, \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" was performed by [[Frank Sinatra]] on the latter's 1968 album ''[[Cycles (Frank Sinatra album)|Cycles]]''. Sinatra would go on to praise \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" as \"the greatest [[torch song]] ever written\".<ref>{{cite news |title=The Man Behind The Hits|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Daily News]]|date=January 17, 1992|url=http://articles.philly.com/1992-01-17/news/26036803_1_jimmy-webb-wichita-lineman-song|last=Takiff|first=Jonathan}}</ref> \n\nAt the 1969 [[Grammy Awards]], Webb accepted awards for \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\", \"Wichita Lineman\", and \"MacArthur Park\". In 2019 \"Wichita Lineman\" was added to the [[National Recording Registry]].<ref name=\"recording-registry\">{{cite web |title=National Recording Registry |url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-recording-preservation-board/recording-registry/registry-by-induction-years/2019/ |website=National Recording Registry for 2019 |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=April 8, 2020 |ref=recording-registry}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Glen Campbell continued the streak of Webb hits with the gold record \"Galveston\" and \"[[Where's the Playground Susie]]\". Webb and Campbell had first met during the production of a [[General Motors]] commercial. Webb arrived at the recording session with his [[The Beatles|Beatle]]-length hair and approached the conservative singer, who looked up from his guitar and said, \"Get a haircut.\"<ref name=\"shane\"/> That same year, two Webb songs became hits for the second time with [[Isaac Hayes]]' soulful version of \"By the Time I Get to Phoenix\" and [[Waylon Jennings]]' Grammy-winning country version of \"MacArthur Park\". On Frank Sinatra's 1969 album ''[[My Way (Frank Sinatra album)|My Way]]'', the singer dove deeper into Webb's songbook with a version of \"Didn't We?\", a number that was originally done by Richard Harris in 1968 and released as the B-side of \"MacArthur Park\". Webb finished the year by writing, arranging, and producing [[Thelma Houston]]'s first album, ''[[Sunshower (Thelma Houston album)|Sunshower]]''.<ref name=\"unofficial\"/> \n\nAs the decade came to a close, so too did Webb's string of hit singles. He began to withdraw from the formulaic process in which he worked and began to experiment with his music. He started work on a semi-autobiographical [[Broadway musical]] called ''His Own Dark City'', which reflected the emotional displacement he felt at the time. He also wrote music for the films ''[[How Sweet It Is!]]'' and ''[[Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here]]''.{{cn|date=December 2022}}\n\n===Singer-songwriter years, 1970\u20131982===\nWebb's career as a singer-songwriter got off to a rough start with the \"counterfeit\" album ''[[Jim Webb Sings Jim Webb]]'', released by Epic Records in 1968. According to Webb, the album was produced \"by a bunch of ruffians from some old demos of mine and tarted up to sound like 'MacArthur Park'\".<ref name=\"uncut-interview\"/> Beginning in 1970, Webb released six original albums of his own songs: ''[[Words and Music (Jimmy Webb album)|Words and Music]]'' (1970), ''[[And So: On]]'' (1971), ''[[Letters (Jimmy Webb album)|Letters]]'' (1972), ''[[Land's End (album)|Land's End]]'' (1974), ''[[El Mirage (album)|El Mirage]]'' (1977), and ''[[Angel Heart (Jimmy Webb album)|Angel Heart]]'' (1982). Despite the critical reception that followed each of these projects, Webb has never been as successful as a performer as he has been as a songwriter and arranger. Each album was noted for its inventive music and memorable lyrics.<ref name=\"shane\"/>\n\nWebb's debut album as a performer, ''[[Words and Music (Jimmy Webb album)|Words and Music]]'', was released on Reprise Records in late 1970 to critical acclaim. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Jon Landau called one of the album's cuts, \"[[P.F. Sloan (song)|P.F. Sloan]]\", a \"masterpiece [that] could not be improved upon\". The album also features the ambitious song trilogy \"Music for an Unmade Movie\". Webb's 1971 follow-up album, ''[[And So: On]]'', proved equally appealing to critics. ''Rolling Stone'' declared the album \"another impressive step in the conspiracy to recover his identity from the housewives of America and rightfully install him at the forefront of contemporary composers/performers.\" The album features the songs \"Met Her on a Plane\", \"All My Love's Laughter\", and \"Marionette\".<ref name=\"allmusic-and-so\"/> Also in 1971, [[the Three Degrees]] are featured in the movie ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' giving a rendition of Webb's song \"Everybody Gets To Go To The Moon\", originally recorded in 1969 by [[Thelma Houston]].\n\nWebb's 1972 album ''[[Letters (Jimmy Webb album)|Letters]]'', which features his own rendition of \"Galveston\", met with similar praise. Music critic Bruce Eder called ''Letters'' the \"most surprising, diverse, and possibly the most satisfying of all of Jimmy Webb's early solo LPs\" and \"arguably the best of Webb's solo albums\".<ref name=\"allmusic-letters\"/> In his review of the album, Peter Reilly of ''[[Stereo Review]]'' wrote, \"Jimmy Webb is the most important pop music figure to emerge since Bob Dylan.\"<ref name=\"shane\"/> The album also features the songs \"Campo de Encino\", an homage to his park-like residence in Encino, California, during the 1970s, \"When Can Brown Begin\", and \"Piano\".<ref name=\"allmusic-letters\"/> \nHe also produced in 1972 album, \"The Supremes Produced And Arranged By Jimmy Webb.\" for [[The Supremes]], featuring Jean Terrell, Mary Wilson and Linda Lawrence. The album sold poorly and did not chart successfully.\n\nIn 1974, Webb released ''[[Land's End (album)|Land's End]]'' on Asylum Records. Unlike his previous albums, which tended to be underproduced, Webb was able to achieve a more heavily produced pop/rock sound on ''Land's End'', which was recorded in England with the help of an all-star session band that included Joni Mitchell, Ringo Starr, and Nigel Olsson.<ref name=\"allmusic-lands\"/> The album contains \"a thematic consistency in that most of its songs were tales of romantic discord\".<ref name=\"allmusic-lands\"/> While Webb continued to improve as a singer, he \"still hadn't found an identity as a solo artist\".<ref name=\"allmusic-lands\"/> The album features the songs \"Ocean in His Eyes\", \"Just This One Time\", and \"Crying in My Sleep\".\n\nIn 1977, Webb released ''[[El Mirage (album)|El Mirage]]'' on Atlantic Records. Produced, arranged, and conducted by [[The Beatles]]' former producer, [[George Martin]], the album was Webb's \"most polished effort yet as a performer\".<ref name=\"allmusic-el\"/> William Ruhlmann observed, \"These were lush tracks full of tasty playing and warm string charts on which Webb's thin tenor was buoyed by numerous background vocalists, the whole an excellent example of the style known as 'West Coast pop'.\"<ref name=\"allmusic-el\"/> The album contains several strong compositions, including \"[[Highwayman (song)|The Highwayman]]\", which would later become a number one country hit for [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Johnny Cash]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]], who named their super group [[The Highwaymen (country supergroup)|The Highwaymen]] after the song. Their version of \"The Highwayman\" won a Grammy Award for Best Country Song.<ref name=\"allmusic-el\"/> ''El Mirage'' also features the songs \"If You See Me Getting Smaller I'm Leaving\", a newly arranged version of \"P.F. Sloan\", and \"[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress (song)|The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]\", which had already been recorded by [[Joe Cocker]], [[Glen Campbell]], and [[Judy Collins]].<ref name=\"allmusic-el\"/> Despite the positive critical response to the album, ''El Mirage'' did not succeed in redefining Webb as a performer as he had hoped.<ref name=\"allmusic-el\"/>\n\nWebb's final solo album from this period, ''[[Angel Heart (Jimmy Webb album)|Angel Heart]]'', was released in 1982 on Lorimar Records. Like its predecessor, the album drew upon the talents of top Los Angeles session musicians to produce a classic West Coast pop sound, enhanced by guest vocal harmonies by Gerry Beckley, Michael McDonald, Graham Nash, Kenny Loggins, Daryl Hall, and Stephen Bishop.<ref name=\"allmusic-angel\"/> Unlike his previous solo albums, however, ''Angel Heart'' lacked the quality material usually associated with the composer. Apart from \"Scissors Cut\" and \"In Cars\", which were previously recorded by [[Art Garfunkel]], the album offered few high points, despite its polished production.<ref name=\"allmusic-angel\"/> A decade would pass before Webb released his next solo album.\n\nThroughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, Webb's songs continued to be recorded by some of the industry's most successful artists. In 1972, Jimmy Webb produced [[The Supremes]]' last album featuring Jean Terrell as lead singer, ''[[The Supremes Produced and Arranged by Jimmy Webb]]''. Webb is quoted as saying he had a crush on [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] when he wrote and produced \"I Keep It Hid\" featuring her on lead vocals. In 1977, the initial release of [[Art Garfunkel]]'s ''[[Watermark (Art Garfunkel album)|Watermark]]'' album consisted exclusively of songs by Webb. In 1978, [[Donna Summer]]'s disco version of \"MacArthur Park\" became a multi-million selling vinyl single that was number one on the American pop music charts for three weeks. In 1980, Thelma Houston recorded \"Before There Could Be Me\", \"Breakwater Cat\", \"Gone\", \"Long Lasting Love\", and \"What Was that Song\" on her album ''[[Breakwater Cat]]''. Leah Kunkel recorded \"Never Gonna Lose My Dream of Love Again\" and \"Let's Begin\" for her album ''I Run with Trouble''. The latter was performed live in 1980 by the born-again Bob Dylan. [[Tanya Tucker]] recorded \"Tennessee Woman\" on her album ''[[Dreamlovers (album)|Dreamlovers]]''. And Frank Sinatra did his own cover of \"MacArthur Park\" on the 1980 album ''[[Trilogy: Past Present Future]]''.\n\nIn 1981, Art Garfunkel recorded \"Scissors Cut\", \"In Cars\", and \"That's All I've Got to Say\" for his album ''[[Scissors Cut]]'', and [[Arlo Guthrie]] recorded \"Oklahoma Nights\" on his album ''Power of Love''. In 1982, [[Linda Ronstadt]] recorded \"The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress\" and \"Easy for You to Say\" on her album ''[[Get Closer (Linda Ronstadt album)|Get Closer]]''. That same year, [[Joe Cocker]] recorded \"Just Like Always\" on his album ''[[Sheffield Steel]]'', and [[the Everly Brothers]] recorded \"She Never Smiles Anymore\" on their album ''Living Legends''.\n\nIn 1981 Webb moved to New York state, and said, \"One day I wondered what happened to the Seventies and all those grandiose schemes.\"<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/interview-jimmy-webb-230726/|title=Interview: Jimmy Webb|first1=Stephen|last1=Holden|website=Rollingstone.com|date=April 29, 1982|access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Large-scale projects, 1982\u20131992===\nFrom 1982 to 1992, Webb turned his focus from solo performing to large-scale projects, such as [[film scores]], Broadway musicals, and [[classical music]]. In 1982, he produced the soundtrack for the film ''[[The Last Unicorn (film)|The Last Unicorn]]'', an animated children's tale, with the musical group [[America (band)|America]] performing five new Jimmy Webb songs: \"The Last Unicorn\", \"Man's Road\", \"In the Sea\", \"Now That I'm a Woman\", and \"That's All I've Got to Say\". The rest of the album contains instrumental music composed, arranged, and conducted by Webb. That same year, he composed the soundtrack to all episodes of the TV series ''[[Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (TV series)|Seven Brides for Seven Brothers]]''.\n\nThe theme music for the 1984-85 TV sitcom ''[[E/R]]'' was written by Webb. Then in 1985, Glen Campbell recorded Webb's \"Cowboy Hall of Fame\" and \"Shattered\" for the album ''It's Just a Matter of Time''. And heavyweights [[Johnny Cash]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Kris Kristofferson]] recorded \"[[Highwayman (song)|Highwayman]]\" on the album ''Highwayman''. In 1988, [[Toto (band)|Toto]] recorded \"Home of the Brave\" on the album ''[[The Seventh One]]''. [[Kenny Rankin]] recorded \"She Moves, Eyes Follow\" for the album ''Hiding in Myself''. And in 1989, Linda Ronstadt recorded the album ''[[Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind]]'', which featured four Jimmy Webb songs: \"Still Within the Sound of My Voice\" (with Webb playing piano), \"Adios\" (with orchestral arrangement by Webb), \"I Keep It Hid\" (with Webb playing piano), and \"Shattered\". In 1990, [[John Denver]] recorded \"Postcard from Paris\" on the album ''[[The Flower That Shattered the Stone (album)|The Flower That Shattered the Stone]]''. In 1991, [[Kenny Rogers]] recorded \"They Just Don't Make Em Like You Anymore\" on the album ''[[Back Home Again (Kenny Rogers album)|Back Home Again]]''.\n\nIn 1986, Webb produced a [[cantata]], ''The Animals' Christmas'', with Art Garfunkel, [[Amy Grant]], and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]. The cantata tells the [[Nativity of Jesus|Christmas story]] from the perspective of animals.\n\nIn 1987, Webb produced the soundtrack for the film ''[[The Hanoi Hilton (film)|The Hanoi Hilton]]''. That same year, he reunited with Campbell for the album ''Still Within the Sound of My Voice'', for which he wrote the title song. They followed this up in 1988 with an album composed almost entirely of Jimmy Webb songs, ''Light Years''. The album included the title song, as well as  \"Lightning in a Bottle\", \"If These Walls Could Speak\" (which was also recorded by Amy Grant that year) and \"Our Movie\". Two songs from 1982's ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'' also appear on the album. The record also included the songs \"Other People's Lives\", \"Wasn't There A Moment\", \"I Don't Know How To Love You Anymore\", and \"Is There Love After You\". Several of these songs later ended up on Webb solo albums.\n\nIn 1992, Webb completed a musical called ''Instant Intimacy'', which he developed with the [[Nashville Repertory Theatre|Tennessee Repertory Theatre]]. The musical contained new songs that he and others would later record, including \"What Does a Woman See in a Man\", \"I Don't Know How to Love You Anymore\", and \"Is There Love After You\". That same year, Webb performed live at the club Cinegrill, performing \"What Does a Woman See in a Man\" and introducing several additional new songs, including \"Sandy Cove\" and an old folk hymn, \"I Will Arise\".\n\n===Solo artist, 1993\u2013present===\nSince 1993, Webb has produced five critically acclaimed solo albums: ''[[Suspending Disbelief]]'' (1993), ''[[Ten Easy Pieces]]'' (1996), ''[[Twilight of the Renegades]]'' (2005), ''[[Just Across the River]]'' (2010), and ''[[Still Within the Sound of My Voice (Jimmy Webb album)|Still Within the Sound of My Voice]]'' (2013). He has continued to expand his creative landscape to include [[musical theatre|musicals]], [[advertising|commercial]] [[jingle]]s, and [[film score]]s.\n\nIn 1994, Webb teamed with [[Nanci Griffith]] to contribute the song \"If These Old Walls Could Speak\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nIn 1997, Webb co-produced [[Carly Simon]]'s ''[[Film Noir (album)|Film Noir]]'' album and contributed his vocals, orchestration, and piano skills to the project, which was filmed for an AMC documentary (which premiered in September 1997). He also co-wrote the song \"Film Noir\" with Simon and reprised his role as arranger and co-producer on Simon's 2008 album, ''[[This Kind of Love]]''.\n\nIn 1998, Webb completed his first book, ''Tunesmith: Inside the Art of Songwriting'', which was published by [[Hachette Books|Hyperion Books]]. It was well-received by songwriters and performers and became a best-seller.<ref>{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Jimmy|title=Tunesmith: Inside the Art of Songwriting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eH4WOv8aTYQC|access-date=October 29, 2011|isbn=9780786884889|date=September 22, 1999|publisher=Hyperion }}</ref> One book reviewer described it as \"a companion every serious songwriter should read, and read again, and keep handy for referral\".<ref name=\"connection\"/>\n \nIn 2007, he released a live album of his show ''[[Live and at Large]]'', which was recorded in the United Kingdom. The album included personal stories and anecdotes about [[Richard Harris]], [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Harry Nilsson]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Art Garfunkel]], [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Rosemary Clooney]].\n\nWebb appears in the 2008 documentary ''[[The Wrecking Crew (2008 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' providing thoughtful and descriptive insights into the world of California session musicians in the 1960s.\n\nIn June 2010, Webb released ''[[Just Across the River]]'', an album of newly arranged Webb songs that featured guest appearances by [[Vince Gill]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[Lucinda Williams]], [[Jackson Browne]], [[Glen Campbell]], [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]], [[Mark Knopfler]], [[JD Souther]], and [[Linda Ronstadt]].\n\nIn 2011, Webb was unanimously elected chairman of the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]], replacing [[Hal David]] who retired after ten years in the position.<ref name=\"songhall\"/>\n\nIn May 2012, Webb traveled to London to receive the [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Special International Award]], which recognizes non-British writers and composers who have made an extraordinary contribution to the global musical landscape.<ref name=\"ivors\"/> In September 2012, Fantasy Records released ''[[Glen Campbell and Jimmy Webb: In Session]]'', a collaborative album by Campbell and Webb. The album and its accompanying DVD were filmed and recorded in December 1988 at the Hamilton, Ontario, studios of [[CHCH-TV]] as part of the Canadian concert series ''In Session''.<ref name=\"allmusic-in-session\"/>\n\nDecades after he sold his first song, Webb's influence on his fellow musicians is ongoing. Rock singer-songwriter [[Bruce Springsteen]] has acknowledged that his 2019 album ''[[Western Stars]]'' was profoundly impacted by Webb's music,<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2016/09/bruce-springsteen-cover-story|title=Cover Story: The Book of Bruce Springsteen|first=David|last=Kamp|date=September 6, 2016|magazine=Vanity Fair}}</ref> and country music singer [[Keith Urban]] cites Webb as his earliest songwriting inspiration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/7604502/dan-rather-keith-urban-the-big-interview|title=Dan Rather to Sit Down With Keith Urban on 'The Big Interview'|first=Chuck|last=Dauphin|date=December 8, 2016|website=Billboard Magazine}}</ref>\n\nWebb continues to perform throughout the United States and abroad.<ref name=\"jw-performances\"/> In 2017 he published an autobiography, ''The Cake and the Rain: A Memoir''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Cake and the Rain: A Memoir|first=Jimmy|last=Webb|date=April 18, 2017|publisher=St. Martin's Press|id={{ASIN|1250058414|country=uk}}}}</ref>\n\nIn 2024, Webb's song \"[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]\" by both [[Donna Summer]] and [[Richard Harris]] was included in the [[Beetlejuice Beetlejuice (soundtrack)|''Beetlejuice Beetlejuice'' soundtrack]].\n\n==Emotional content of songs==\nWhile some of Webb's songs are happy, such as \"Up, Up and Away\", he has said that \"The territory I tend to inhabit is that sort of 'crushed lonely hearts' thing. The first part of a relationship is usually that white-hot centre when all the happy songs come.

He began his musical career in 1961 as a member of a local band, The Rumours. The band included [[Gram Parsons]] and [[Jim Stafford]], as well as drummer Jon Corneal, who later joined Parsons's [[International Submarine Band]].<ref name=BandBoxRecords>{{cite web|url=https://kimsloans.wordpress.com/tag/lobo-with-the-rumours-1960s-band-with-gram-parsons/|title=Lobo with the Rumours|website=PopBopRocktilUDrop|date=6 March 2021}}</ref>\n\nIn 1964, while attending the [[University of South Florida]], LaVoie joined a band called the Sugar Beats<ref name=BandBoxRecords /> and met producer [[Phil Gernhard]]. He recorded a regional hit for the band, a cover of [[Johnny Rivers]]'s song, \"What Am I Doing Here?\"<ref name=BandBoxRecords />\n\nDuring the 1960s, LaVoie performed with many other bands, including US Male, The Uglies, and Me and the Other Guys.<ref name=BandBoxRecords /> It was in the latter band that he met musician Billy Aerts, who became a member of Lobo's touring band in the early 1970s and produced Lobo's comeback album in 1989.\n\nAgain working with Gernhard, his first solo record was released in 1969 on [[Laurie Records]]. It included the original tracks \"Happy Days in New York City\" backed with \"My Friend Is Here\".\n\n===1971\u20131975: Success with Big Tree===\nBy 1971, LaVoie had started calling himself Lobo (Spanish for [[wolf]]). Gernhard was an executive for [[Big Tree Records]], and the company released his first single, \"[[Me and You and a Dog Named Boo]]\", in March 1971.  The first major hit for the label, it reached No. 5 in the US and No. 4 in the UK by May, launching a successful series of singles. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] in September 1971.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/297 297]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/297\n}}</ref>\n\nHis debut album, ''Introducing Lobo'', came in  May 1971. In June his second single, \"She Didn't Do Magic\", was released. In September, \"California Kid and Reemo\" was released, followed by ''The Albatross''. When Big Tree Records merged with [[Bell Records]], Lobo's second project album ''Close Up'' was never released.\n\nUnder the Lobo alias, he then released ''Of a Simple Man'' in 1972, which included back-to-back U.S. Top 10 hits, including \"[[I'd Love You to Want Me]]\" (No. 2, November 18\u201325, 1972) and \"[[Don't Expect Me to Be Your Friend]]\" (No. 8, February 17\u201324, 1973).  The former became Lobo's biggest hit, a million-seller gaining gold disc status in November 1972<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\"/> and internationally reaching No. 1 in Germany in December 1973 and No. 5 in the United Kingdom in July 1974.\n\nWith the release of ''Calumet'' in 1973, Lobo had three more [[Top 40]] hits: \"It Sure Took a Long, Long Time\", \"[[How Can I Tell Her]]\", and \"Standing at the End of the Line\". He made an appearance on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' that year. There were two further minor hit singles from the album: \"There Ain't No Way\" and \"Love Me for What I Am\".\n\nIn June 1974 Lobo's fourth album, ''Just a Singer'', was released. It was the first album by Lobo to contain tracks not written by him. The only single from the album was \"Rings\". \"Don't Tell Me Goodnight\" in 1975 became his last Top 30 single for Big Tree. Lobo also released the album, ''A Cowboy Afraid of Horses'', with \"Would I Still Have You\" released as a single. The label followed it up with a compilation album that year entitled ''The Best of Lobo''.\n\n===1976\u20131985: Curb Records, and move to Nashville===\nIn 1976 Lobo broke away from Big Tree, releasing the album ''Come with Me'' in Europe on the [[Philips Records|Philips]] label.  \"At First Sight\" and \"It's Everywhere\" were the singles.  Neither was released in the US.\n\nLobo signed with [[Curb Records]] in 1977, releasing the single \"Afterglow\", co-produced by Lobo and Gernhard, and in 1978 \"You Are All I'll Ever Need\".  No full-length album materialized from these sessions.\n\nIn 1979 Lobo was signed to Curb/[[MCA Records]], where he worked with producer [[Bob Montgomery (musician)|Bob Montgomery]], releasing the single \"Where Were You When I Was Falling in Love\", which reached No. 23.  The song also reached No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary chart.  He also released his first US album in four years, ''Lobo''. Other singles for Curb were \"Holding On for Dear Love\", \"With a Love Like Ours\", and \"Fight Fire with Fire\".\n\nReportedly dissatisfied with the production of his records, Lobo sought a release from his Curb contract.  He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and, in 1981, started his [[Private brand|own label]], Lobo Records, releasing several singles including \"I Don't Want to Want You\" (written by his brother, Roger LaVoie), \"Come Looking for Me\", and \"Living My Life Without You\", all of which charted in the country charts.  He also released \"Bull Smith Can't Dance the Cotton Eye Joe\" with the group Wolfpack, which included Narvel Felts and Kenny Earl.\n\nLobo Records was renamed Evergreen Records in 1985.  The label released two of his singles: \"Am I Going Crazy\" and \"Paint the Town Blue\", the latter a duet with Robin Lee.\n\n===1987\u2013present: Asian popularity and recent years===\nAlthough he is far less followed now in the United States, Lobo's popularity grew in Asia, fanned by the release of his [[greatest hits]] compilations in 1987 and 1988. This encouraged him to release in 1989 his first new album in 10 years, entitled ''Am I Going Crazy''. It was recorded in [[Taiwan]] on UFO/WEA Records and was produced by Billy Aerts. He signed a multi-album deal with PonyCanyon Records in Singapore, and in 1994 released ''Asian Moon'', repackaging some of the tracks from ''Am I Going Crazy'' along with newly recorded material. His follow-up album ''Classic Hits'' in 1995 were re-recordings of Lobo hits and some [[cover version]]s. In 1996 he released the album ''Sometimes'', containing all new original songs.\n\nOn another Asian label, Springroll Entertainment, he released ''You Must Remember This'' in 1997, an album of [[pop standards]] that was released in two formats, one with vocals and the other with instrumental tracks.\n\nIn 2000, Lobo signed with a German record company, Gmbh Entertainment, and recorded a few tracks for various hits CDs. He also co-wrote two [[Christmas music|Christmas songs]] with Billy Aerts, \"A Big Kid's Christmas\" and \"Late Christmas Eve\", which have been released on various Christmas compilations from 2000 to present. Singles recorded during this period include \"[[Let It Be Me (The Everly Brothers song)|Let It Be Me]]\", \"Who'll Stop the Rain\", and \"Different Drum\".\n\nIn 2006, based on his Asian popularity, he toured in Southeast Asia. In 2008, Lobo released ''Out of Time'' with old favorites and some new songs. A tribute album to the original era of the early Lobo recordings was made available from the website.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

She is best known for the million selling 1961 hits \"[[Sad Movies (Make Me Cry)]]\" and \"[[Norman (song)|Norman]]\", \"James (Hold The Ladder Steady)\" (1962), and \"Paper Tiger\" (1965).\n\n==Early life==\nThompson was born in [[Nevada, Missouri]] in July 1925. By the age of 7, she was singing and playing the guitar on stage.  She later moved with her family to live in [[San Jose, California]].<ref name=allmusic>{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p1836/biography|pure_url=yes}} Sue Thompson biography at Allmusic</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], she worked at a defense plant.  She married when she was 17, and had a daughter at 20, but the marriage failed and she and her husband split up after three years. To keep supporting herself after her divorce, she returned to the [[nightclub]] scene in [[California]], now using the name Sue Thompson. In San Jose, she won a talent contest, thus catching the attention of a bandleader and radio/TV host named Dude Martin (real name John Stephen McSwain), who invited her to sing with his band. This led to their marriage.<ref name=kienzle>{{cite book |last=Kienzle |first=Rich |author-link= |date=2013 |title=Southwest Shuffle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WFf_RbP6xlsC&dq=%22Hank+Penny%22+%22Sue+Thompson%22&pg=PA50 |location= |publisher= Taylor & Francis|pages=50\u201351 |isbn=9781136718892}}</ref> They recorded duets together, including \"If You Want Some Lovin'\", which helped her get a solo contract from [[Mercury Records]] in 1950.<ref name=allmusic/>  She released numerous singles on Mercury between 1951 and 1954, with no chart action.\n\n==Recording career==\nWithin a year, she divorced Martin, and married [[Hank Penny]], a comedian and singer, in 1953.<ref name=kienzle/>  Penny and Thompson hosted a TV show in [[Los Angeles]] together before eventually moving to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. After her contract with Mercury ended, Thompson recorded for [[Decca Records]] from 1954\u201357, again without a commercial breakthrough.   Thompson and Penny had a son, [[Greg Penny]], but divorced in 1963.<ref name=kienzle/>\n\nIn 1960, Thompson signed on with [[Columbia Records]], who renamed the singer \"Taffy Thomas\" and issued one non-charting single under this artist name.  Thereafter, the Taffy Thomas moniker was quickly dropped, and Thompson signed with [[Hickory Records]]. In 1961, after having issued over a dozen non-charting singles in a decade-long recording career, Thompson's \"[[Sad Movies (Make Me Cry)]]\" became a No.&nbsp;5 hit on the [[Pop (music)|pop]] charts.  She followed this up successfully with \"[[Norman (song)|Norman]],\" which reached No.&nbsp;3. Both of these hit singles were written by [[songwriter]] [[John D. Loudermilk]]. They both sold over one million copies, and were awarded [[music recording sales certification|gold discs]]. Both were also chart successes in Australia, reaching #3 and #8 respectively.<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd| location= London| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/140 140]| isbn= 0-214-20512-6| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/140}}</ref>\n\nIn 1962, \"Have a Good Time\" was a Top 40 hit and in 1963, \"Willie Can\" was a minor hit.  Her early-1960s hits made Thompson, then in her late-thirties but with a much younger-sounding voice, a favorite among the teenage crowd and briefly a rival to the much younger [[Connie Francis]] and [[Brenda Lee]].<ref name=allmusic/> Two additional hits, also written by Loudermilk, were \"James (Hold the Ladder Steady)\", and 1965's \"Paper Tiger,\" her last Top 30 hit and her biggest hit in Britain and in Australia, where it reached #3.\n\n==Later career==\nIn the late 1960s, she went back to country music and released the album ''This Is Sue Thompson Country'' in 1969.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/album/this-is-sue-thompson-country-mw0000891899 This Is Sue Thompson Country Album Information].

Known for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and [[Cultural impact of Taylor Swift|cultural impact]], Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of [[Public image of Taylor Swift|widespread public interest]]. \n\nSwift signed with [[Big Machine Records]] in 2005, starting as a [[country pop]] singer with her first two albums ''[[Taylor Swift (album)|Taylor Swift]]'' (2006) and ''[[Fearless (Taylor Swift album)|Fearless]]'' (2008). Their singles \"[[Teardrops on My Guitar]]\", \"[[Love Story (Taylor Swift song)|Love Story]]\", and \"[[You Belong with Me]]\" were [[Crossover music|crossover]] successes on [[Country radio|country]] and [[Contemporary hit radio|pop]] radio formats. She experimented with [[Rock music|rock]] on ''[[Speak Now]]'' (2010) and [[Electronic music|electronic]] on ''[[Red (Taylor Swift album)|Red]]'' (2012), later recalibrating her image from country to pop music with the [[synth-pop]] album ''[[1989 (album)|1989]]'' (2014). The ensuing media scrutiny inspired the [[hip-hop]]-imbued ''[[Reputation (album)|Reputation]]'' (2017); the albums contained the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one singles \"[[We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]]\", \"[[Shake It Off]]\", \"[[Blank Space]]\", \"[[Bad Blood (Taylor Swift song)|Bad Blood]]\", and \"[[Look What You Made Me Do]]\". \n\nShifting to [[Republic Records]] in 2018, Swift released the [[electropop]] album ''[[Lover (album)|Lover]]'' (2019) and the autobiographical documentary ''[[Miss Americana]]'' (2020). She explored [[indie folk]] styles in the 2020 sister-albums ''[[Folklore (Taylor Swift album)|Folklore]]'' and ''[[Evermore]]'' and subdued pop genres on ''[[Midnights]]'' (2022) and ''[[The Tortured Poets Department]]'' (2024), while also [[Re-recording (music)|re-recording]] four of her albums under the ''[[Taylor's Version|(Taylor's Version)]]'' subtitle,{{efn|Namely, ''[[Fearless (Taylor's Version)]]'' and ''[[Red (Taylor's Version)]]'' in 2021, followed by ''[[Speak Now (Taylor's Version)]]'' and ''[[1989 (Taylor's Version)]]'' in 2023.}} after an [[Taylor Swift masters dispute|ownership dispute with Big Machine]]. The albums garnered the U.S. number one songs \"[[Cruel Summer (Taylor Swift song)|Cruel Summer]]\", \"[[Cardigan (song)|Cardigan]]\", \"[[Willow (song)|Willow]]\", \"[[All Too Well]]\", \"[[Anti-Hero (song)|Anti-Hero]]\", \"[[Is It Over Now?]]\", and \"[[Fortnight (song)|Fortnight]]\" in the 2020s. Her sixth concert tour, [[the Eras Tour]] (2023\u20132024), and [[Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour|its accompanying concert film]] are respectively [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|the highest-grossing tour]] and [[Concert film#Highest-grossing concert films|concert film]] of all time; Swift became the [[List of music artists by net worth|first billionaire with music]] as the main source of income and the [[List of highest-grossing live music artists|highest-grossing female touring act]].\n\nSwift is one of the [[world's best-selling music artists]] with an estimated global sale of 200 million records. Seven of [[Taylor Swift albums discography|her albums]] have opened with [[List of fastest-selling albums|over one million pure sales in a week]]. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']], and ''[[Forbes]]'', as well as the only individual from [[the arts]] to have been named the [[Time Person of the Year|''Time'' Person of the Year]] (2023).

As a child, Porter made acting appearances in ''[[Parenthood (film)|Parenthood]]'', ''[[Stella (1990 film)|Stella]]'' and ''[[I Love You to Death]]''. Her breakout role came in 1991, when she played the lead in the film ''[[Curly Sue]]'' opposite [[Jim Belushi]].\n\nAs an adult, Porter pursued roles in musical theatre, including a run in ''[[The Ten Commandments: The Musical]]'' and as an original cast member of the Broadway revival of ''[[A Chorus Line]]''. A solo album followed in 2009. In 2016, she auditioned for the [[The Voice (American TV series) season 10|tenth season]] of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Voice (American TV series)|The Voice]]'', earning a spot on Team [[Christina Aguilera|Christina]]. In May of that same year, Porter was named the winner of the show.\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn to [[American Jews|Jewish]] parents in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], Porter is the great-granddaughter of prominent Worcester rabbi [[Temple Emanuel Sinai (Worcester, Massachusetts)#Temple Emanuel history|Joseph Klein]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Gold|first=Sylviane|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/On+the+rise:+Alisan+Porter+born+to+play+Chorus+Line's+Bebe-a0152433195|title=On the rise: Alisan Porter born to play Chorus Line's Bebe|work=[[Dance Magazine]]|via=[[The Free Library]]|date=October 1, 2006|access-date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> Her grandmother ran the Charlotte Klein Dance Center.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duckett|first=Richard|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20060608/news/606080450|title=Following in mother's dance-steps|work=[[Telegram & Gazette]]|location=[[Worcester, Massachusetts]]|date=June 8, 2006|access-date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> Porter's father, Ric Porter, was co-founder, lead singer, and songwriter of the Worcester-based band Zonkaraz.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williamson|first=Dianne|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20130530/COLUMN01/105309875?_ga=1.24358073.2067001835.1465261530|title=Zonkaraz still feels the love|work=[[Telegram & Gazette]]|location=[[Worcester, Massachusetts]]|date=June 5, 2016|access-date=June 6, 2016}}</ref> Her mother, Laura Klein, also taught dance, coaching [[Klimaszewski Twins|Diane and Elaine Klimaszewski]], who appeared on ''[[Star Search]]'' in 1987 in the junior dance category before they became known as the Coors Light Twins. While in Los Angeles for the twins' appearance on ''Star Search'', the show's producer heard Porter singing in the hotel lobby and booked her to appear on the next episode. Porter has been singing and performing since age three; at age five, she became the youngest ''Star Search'' participant ever to win the competition. That same year, she also appeared on [[Pee Wee's Playhouse]] as one of the playhouse gang in Season 2.\n\nPorter acted in several films as a child; she became known for playing the title role in the 1991 movie ''[[Curly Sue]]'' opposite [[Jim Belushi]]. On television, she played the youngest daughter of [[Lynn Redgrave]] on the short-lived ABC sitcom ''[[Chicken Soup (TV series)|Chicken Soup]]'' in 1989. The following year, she was slated to be a new regular cast member on ''[[Perfect Strangers (TV series)|Perfect Strangers]]'', but her character was dropped after only one episode.\n\nPorter continued acting at Staples High School in [[Westport, Connecticut]], where she joined a theater group and participated in various shows. While a freshman, Porter portrayed Anita in ''[[West Side Story]]'', and as a senior played the lead in ''Cinderella''. After Porter won ''The Voice'' in 2016, her former high school drama teacher said she was not surprised by the result. \"She blew everybody away\" with her performance in ''West Side Story'', and \"really seemed to get the best out of everybody else. Her energy rubbed off on everybody.

In the 1980s, she recorded [[Christian music]] which garnered her four top 10 [[Contemporary Christian music|Contemporary Christian]] albums as well as two more Grammys. Throughout her career, Boone has appeared in several musical theater productions and has co-authored many children's books with her husband  Gabriel Ferrer.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Beginnings===\nDebby Boone was born in [[Hackensack, New Jersey]], the third of four daughters born to singer-actor [[Pat Boone]] and Shirley Foley Boone, daughter of country music star [[Red Foley]]. When Boone was 14&nbsp;years old, she began touring with her parents and three sisters: [[Cherry Boone|Cherry]], Lindy, and Laury. The sisters first recorded with their parents as The Pat Boone Family and later as the Boones or Boone Girls. They primarily recorded gospel music, although the sisters also released singles for the [[Motown]] and [[Curb Records|Curb]] labels that were remakes of secular pop music featuring Debby as the lead vocalist.\n\nThe Boones twice reached [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s AC charts with 1975's \"When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes\" (No. 25), a remake of the [[Supremes]]' first top 40 hit, and 1977's \"[[Hasta Ma\u00f1ana]]\" (No. 32), a cover of a track from [[ABBA]]'s ''[[Waterloo (album)|Waterloo]]'' album.\n\n===\"You Light Up My Life\"===\nWith her older sisters married and younger sister Laury in college, Boone was actively encouraged by producer [[Mike Curb]] to launch a solo career. Boone released her first solo effort, \"[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]]\" (which had been featured in the film of the same name), in 1977.

Like \"You Light Up My Life\", the song was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for its composers, the [[Sherman Brothers]],<ref name=\"ew\"/> but it failed to replicate the success of her first single, charting only No. 48 AC.

A few weeks before her birth Toon died. Three years later, Toni's mother married Stefan Kowalczyk. Stefan was a Polish [[miner]] from [[W\u0142oszczowa]], Poland who came to the Netherlands in 1948 to work in the coal mines after serving in the [[US Army]] in [[Germany]].\n\n==Childhood==\nMarianne's, Betty's and Toni's biological father died from [[Hodgkin's disease]] shortly before Toni's birth. At the time, her sister Marianne was two years old and Betty was only one. Three years later her mother, Marie Verheijen, married Stefan Kowalczyk, the Polish miner who brought up Toni and her sisters. He promoted their music talents. When Toni, Betty and Marianne were six, seven and eight, the family moved to Treebeek, a cityquarter in [[Brunssum]] in the south-east [[Netherlands]]. At the annual children's festivities of [[Sinterklaas]], he bought them each an acoustic guitar and engaged Ben Keuzenkamp as guitar tutor. With guitars they performed during carnivals, talent scoutings and parties as The Singing Sisters.  It was during this time that their characteristic close harmony style singing came into being.  Their repertoire initially consisted mostly of German pop songs.  However they say, this kind of music soon ended with the arrival of the Beatles.<ref name=\"3 FM\">{{cite web|last=3 FM|title=Pussycat Biography|url=http://www.3fm.nl/artiest/1206/pussycat/biografie}}</ref> A few years later, Keuzenkamp introduced the sisters to 18-year-old [[Werner Theunissen]], a guitarist from 'The Entertainers' whom he got in touch with through an ad in the papers. [[Werner Theunissen|Werner]] taught them a lot of new guitar chords and acquainted them with contemporary pop music. It was then that they became a proper girl band with Betty on solo guitar, Marianne on bass, Toni on vocals and a friend Tonny Jeroense on drums.<ref name=\"3 FM\" />\n\n==Musical career==\n[[File:Sweet Reaction 1973.jpg|thumb|left|The BGs from Holland \u2013 in the late 1960s (Left to Right) Tonny Jeroense, Marianne, Betty and Toni Veldpaus]]\n\nToni's career as lead vocalist of [[Pussycat (band)|Pussycat]] started with her two older siblings, Betty and Marianne Veldpaus as The Singing Sisters (Zingende Zusjes) in 1963.<ref name=\"3 FM\" />\n\nWhen the beat-era came, The Singing Sisters changed their style. It was around this time they introduced a female drummer, Tonny Jeroense, and began to call themselves 'The BGs' or 'The Beat Girls from Holland', one of the first female groups in the [[Netherlands]]. They sang Bee Gees and Motown songs with close harmony and so people referred to them as the Dutch [[Bee Gees]]. They practiced in the garage under their house. The sisters recollect as those days being the best time of their lives. They even performed in the French part of Belgium.  To make their travelling easier, their parents bought them a minivan along with some music equipment.<ref name=\"3 FM\" />\n\nA few years later, they recruited male members to the band. In 1973, the new [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] led by guitar teacher [[Werner Theunissen]] was renamed 'Sweet Reaction'. The members now included Toni and her two sisters along with Lou Will\u00e9 (guitarist from a band called Ricky Rendall and His Centurions), and Hans Lutjens (drummer from a band called Scum).<ref name=\"alex gitlin - pussycat\">{{cite web|last1=Pussycat|title=alex gitlin|url=http://www.alexgitlin.com/pcat.htm}}</ref> Werner, their composer continued writing songs with three part vocals. In the same year, Sweet Reaction released their first single \"''Tell Alain''\" on the '[[Telstar]] label owned by Johnny Hoes. Although the single was unsuccessful as it didn't sell well, they ended up performing it on Eddy Becker's 'The Eddy-Go-Round Show'.  Apart from [[Demis Roussos]], another guest on that show was [[Soulful Dynamics]] which had a big hit with the song \"[[Mademoiselle Ninette]]\" at that time. With their Belgian producers, Toni's band the 'Sweet Reaction' recorded the song ''\"Come Back my Dream\"'', the successor of ''\"Tell Alain\"''. This song achieved reasonable success and acclaim. Soon after this success, Johnny Hoes released ''\"Daddy\"'' under his record label which was their third single in a row. It was around this time the band seemed to urgently need a name change. So when the single ''\"Daddy\"'' was released, underneath the band name on the cover it read in glaring letters \"Now Pussycat\".  After this, Toni went on to record a solo single called \"''Let me Live my life''\", backed by ''\"For You\"'' under the moniker 'Sally Lane'. However, this single was not a success either.<ref name=\"stars of the past - pussycat\">{{cite web|last1=Pussycat|title=Stars of the Past|url=http://starpast.blogspot.in/2011/11/pussycat.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Muziek Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|last1=Muziek Encyclopedia|title=Biografie Pussycat|url=http://www.muziekencyclopedie.nl/action/entry/Pussycat#}}</ref>\n\n==Pussycat==\n{{Quote box|width=220px|align=right|bgcolor=Cornsilk|quote=''Although we started as a hobby, we had to build a professional organization due to the success of \"''Mississippi''\".

Although the band from [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], featuring the three sisters had many more hits the following years, \"''Mississippi''\" is still considered to be the band's undisputed [[masterpiece]].

Four million singles were sold in 1976. It was the most sold record in  Germany. In [[Brazil]] \"''Mississippi''\" stayed in the charts for 129 weeks .

These songs were translated into German for single release in Germany.  They also released a German version of \"''Mississippi''\". But it did not do as well as the English version. Apart from these songs, they also came out with German versions of \"''Take Me, Take Me''\" (Heute Heute Heute) and \"''Pasadena''\". With \"''Same Old Song''\" and \"''Doin' La Bamba''\" both huge hits of the 1980, they were able to get a taste of the old [[Motown]] songs once more. During the following 10 years, six albums and 17 [[Single (music)|singles]] were produced, all successful.<ref name=\"Toni Wille\">{{cite web|last=Golden Oldies|title=Toni Will\u00e9 (Pussycat)|url=http://www.golden-oldies.nl/toni_wille_gb.htm}}</ref>\n\nPussycat continued to record albums and singles as well as perform all over the world throughout the late 70's and early 80's before breaking up in 1985. Betty focused on raising a family, Marianne became the owner of a bar in [[Brunssum]], and Toni, who has a son and daughter, is the only one who pursued a professional career in music.  In 1999, however, the three of them got back together to perform at several reunion concerts. More recently Pussycat contributed to the country band Major Dundee's single ''\"Somewhere Someone\"'' in 2005 and singer [[:nl:Dennis Jones|Dennis Jones]]' Dutch reggae cover of their signature hit song \"[[Mississippi (Pussycat song)|Mississippi]]\" in 2007.\n\n==The story behind Mississippi==\n{{Quote box|width=220px|align=left|bgcolor=Cornsilk|quote=''The success of \"Mississippi\" overwhelmed us. We were more or less knocked out by it, because we never dreamed that the debut was such a strong one. As a matter of fact, we weren't ready for it. Pussycat was a kind of a hobby for us then. For instance, I was still working.  Our lives went on an overdrive.  We could not keep our jobs as typists as we were dragged all over the place, from one show to the other.  \"Mississippi\" has made all our dreams come true. Everywhere the three of us go, we still get asked to sing it.  Over the years we may have sung the song over ten thousand times, but we will never get tired of it!''.|source= \u2013 Toni remembering the commotion around their debut.<ref name=\"Covers and Rarities\">{{cite news|last1=Brothers Gibb|title=Covers and Rarities|url=http://www.brothersgibb.org/covers-part2.html}}</ref>\n}}\n\n{{Quote box|width=220px|align=right|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=''The particular country sound in our songs certainly has to do with our voices, which contain a country like warmth.

Our producer Pim Koopman was also partly responsible for our change of sound''.|source= \u2013 Toni talks about the country sound in their music<ref name=\"Covers and Rarities\"/>\n}}\n\n\"Mississippi\" was another song composed by [[Werner Theunissen]]. It was written in the same vein as \"[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]\" by the Bee Gees, a song he liked very much.  The band started to play the song live for a few months and later they sent a demo of it to EMI Bovema in Heemstede, who were immediately interested.  They ended up re-recording the song in the EMI Studio. But this did not work out as planned. Their producer at that time Eddy Hilberts who had success with a repertoire of country songs gave a country like twist to the song. Personally the sisters did not have anything with country music, although influenced by the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], they liked country rock.<ref name=\"3 FM\"/>\n\n\"Mississippi\" was released as a single in April 1975. Initially, it did nothing, until Meta de Vries, the Dutch [[radio jockey]] started playing it.  She thought [[Pussycat (band)|Pussycat]] was an English band. Hans Van Willigenburg played the song on his radio programme as well.  During his broadcast, he would play three new songs, after which listeners could vote by postcard which artist should be invited to his studio.  They voted for Pussycat.  The group also performed the song for the TV show 'Herkent U Deze Tijd' by Kick Stokhuyzen. The same week the single entered the Top 40 in November 1975.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dutch Charts|title=Pussycat Singles|url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/search.asp?search=pussycat&cat=s}}</ref>  The following week, they performed \"Mississippi\"' at TopPop and a week later, the single had climbed to # 1. Although Toni and Marianne still worked as typists for DSM, they were unable to maintain their jobs as besides the Netherlands, \"Mississippi\" had become No. 1 in Germany as well. As their fame grew, the band realized they needed a manager, so their record company got them their new manager Jan Buys.<ref name=\"Pussycat Nostalgia\">{{cite news|last1=NPO Radio 5|title=Weekartiest \u2013 Pussycat|url=http://nostalgia.radio5.nl/weekartiest/2448/pussycat.html}}</ref>\n\nOddly enough, at first they did not want to release the single in  Germany nor UK because of the initial lack of interest. Eventually, the single was released in the UK on Sonet, a small record label. In the fall of 1976, the single was number 1 in the UK charts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=UK Top 100 \u2013 1976|title=Mississippi|url=http://www.uk-charts.top-source.info/top-100-1976.shtml}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the Netherlands, Germany and UK, the single was #1 in [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Norway]] and [[Brazil]].

Their new producer was now [[Pim Koopman]].<ref name=\"Muziek Encyclopedia\" />\n\nA few more hits and in the meantime, family life started to take effect within the band.  Betty had a little child and so had Toni.

Once they met with Clapton, Coolidge played the piece she composed for him and she gave him a cassette.<ref name=\":4\" /> Clapton, impressed by the piece, used it as part of the song in the ending section which she found out by hearing the song over a [[Public address system|PA system]] a year later.

Let it go.\" She has not heard from Clapton himself but believes he is aware of the situation.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThough only Gordon has been officially credited with writing the section, the band's keyboardist [[Bobby Whitlock]] said: <blockquote>Jim took that piano melody from his ex-girlfriend, Rita Coolidge. I know because in the [[Delaney & Bonnie]] days, I lived in John Garfield's old house in the [[Hollywood Hills]] and there was a guest house with an upright piano in it. Rita and Jim were up there in the guest house and invited me to join in on writing this song with them called \"Time\". Her sister Priscilla wound up recording it with her husband, Booker T. Jones (of [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]]). Jim took the melody from Rita's song and didn't give her credit for writing it.
