Along with her participation in [[Farm Aid]] and [[Amnesty International]] concerts, Raitt traveled to [[Moscow, Russia]] in 1987 to participate in the first joint Soviet/American Peace Concert, later shown on the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network. Also in 1987, Raitt organized a benefit in [[Los Angeles]] for Countdown '87 to Stop [[Contras|Contra]] Aid. The benefit featured herself, along with [[Don Henley]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and others.\n\nTwo years after Warner Brothers Records dropped Raitt from their label, they notified her of their plans to release the ''Tongue and Groove'' album. \"I said it wasn't really fair,\" recalled Raitt. \"I think at this point they felt kind of bad.

Active since 1990, he has recorded eight studio albums, and has charted more than twenty singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts. His highest-charting hits are \"[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]\" (1992), \"[[Tender Moment]]\" (1993), and \"[[A Little Bit of You (Lee Roy Parnell song)|A Little Bit of You]]\" (1995), all of which peaked at No.&nbsp;2. Four more of his singles have charted in the Top Ten as well. Parnell made a shift in the early 2000s back to the bluesier sounds of his early works, releasing two blues albums on [[Vanguard Records]] and [[Universal South]]. Besides his own work, Parnell has played [[slide guitar]] and [[National String Instrument Corporation|National guitar]] on several other country and blues recordings.\n\n==Early years==\nParnell was born in [[Abilene, Texas]], but raised in [[Stephenville, Texas]].<ref name=\"encyclopedia\">{{cite book|last1=Stambler|first1=Irwin|last2=Landon|first2=Grelun|title=Country Music: The Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d18K8QWcEo8C&q=%22lee+roy+parnell%22&pg=PA359|date=July 14, 2000|publisher=Macmillan|pages=359\u2013360|isbn=9780312264871}}</ref> His father had performed with [[Bob Wills]], and Parnell gave his first performance at age six on Wills' radio show.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Parnell played guitar and drums in various bands during his teenage years. He joined [[Kinky Friedman]]'s [[Texas Jewboys]] in his late teens and moved to Austin in 1974 to join the city's budding music scene. <ref name=\"allmusic\"/> He moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1987, and he signed with the [[Arista Nashville]] recording company two years later.<ref name=\"encyclopedia\"/>\n\n==Career==\n===''Lee Roy Parnell''===\nParnell released his [[Lee Roy Parnell (album)|self-titled debut album]] for [[Arista Records]] in 1990.<ref name=\"Rusty Russell 2009\">Rusty Russell.  \"Lee Roy Parnell: A Nashville hitmaker breaks out. \" Guitar Player  December 1, 2001: General Interest Module, ProQuest. Web.  July 14, 2009.</ref> This album produced three chart singles in \"Crocodile Tears\", \"Oughta Be a Law\" and \"Family Tree\", none of which charted in the Top 40 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country charts. A video for \"Mexican Money\" was created and released, but the song was not released to radio.\n\n===''Love Without Mercy''===\n''[[Love Without Mercy]]'' was Parnell's breakthrough album, released in 1992. Although its lead-off single \"The Rock\" fell short of Top 40, the next three singles all reached Top Ten:<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> \"[[What Kind of Fool Do You Think I Am]]\" at No.&nbsp;2, the title track at No.&nbsp;8, and finally \"Tender Moment\" also at No.&nbsp;2. These three were also Top Ten hits on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' charts in Canada.\n\n===''On the Road''===\n1993's ''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'', Parnell's third album for the Arista label, also produced two top-10 hits: the [[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell song)|title track]] and \"I'm Holding My Own\", at No.&nbsp;6 and No.&nbsp;3 respectively. The album also contained a No.&nbsp;17-peaking rendition of the [[Hank Williams]] song \"Take These Chains from My Heart\", which Parnell recorded as a duet with [[Ronnie Dunn]] of [[Brooks & Dunn]], although Dunn was not credited on the chart. The final single from ''On the Road'', \"The Power of Love\", peaked at No.&nbsp;51.\n\n===''We All Get Lucky Sometimes''===\nParnell's fourth album, 1995's ''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'', was also his first for Career Records, then a newly formed subsidiary of [[Arista Nashville]]. This album's lead-off single \"A Little Bit of You\" was the third single of his career to reach No.&nbsp;2. Following it were the No.&nbsp;12 \"When a Woman Loves a Man\" (featuring background vocals by [[Trisha Yearwood]]), the No.&nbsp;3 \"Heart's Desire\" and another No.&nbsp;12 in \"Giving Water to a Drowning Man\". The album's title track, which was its fifth single, peaked at No.&nbsp;46.\n\n===''Every Night's a Saturday Night'' and ''Hits and Highways Ahead''===\n''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' was Parnell's final release for Career Records. This was his first album since his debut release that did not produce a Top Ten hit, and only three singles were released from it: \"Lucky Me, Lucky You\" at No.&nbsp;35, \"You Can't Get There From Here\" at No.&nbsp;39 (his final Top 40 hit), and \"All That Matters Anymore\" at No.&nbsp;50. After Career Records was merged back into Arista Nashville, Parnell released his final album for the Arista label, 1999's ''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]''. This album's only single, \"She Won't Be Lonely Long\", peaked at No.&nbsp;57, and by the year's end, Parnell exited Arista's roster.\n\n===''Tell the Truth'', ''Back to the Well'' and ''Midnight Believer''===\nIn 2000 Parnell signed to [[Vanguard Records]]<ref name=\"Rusty Russell 2009\"/> and released the album ''Tell the Truth''. This album's only single, \"South by Southwest\", failed to chart, and he soon left the label as well. Parnell's next album, ''Back to the Well'', came in 2006 on [[Universal South Records]], although it also produced only one non-charting single in \"Daddies and Daughters.\"\n\n==External contributions==\nBesides playing [[slide guitar]] and [[National guitar]] on his albums and co-writing several of his own songs, Parnell has co-written two Top 40 country hits for other artists: \"Too Much\" by [[Pirates of the Mississippi]] and \"[[That's My Story (song)|That's My Story]]\" by [[Collin Raye]], from 1992 and 1993 respectively. In 1994, he and [[Steve Wariner]] collaborated with [[Diamond Rio]] on a cover of [[Merle Haggard]]'s \"[[Workin' Man's Blues]]\", credited to Jed Zeppelin and recorded for a tribute album ''[[Mama's Hungry Eyes: A Tribute to Merle Haggard]]''. This rendition peaked at No.&nbsp;48 on the country charts. He played slide guitar on [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]]'s late-1994 Number One hit \"[[Shut Up and Kiss Me (Mary Chapin Carpenter song)|Shut Up and Kiss Me]]\", and appeared in the song's music video. Parnell added slide guitar to [[Delbert McClinton]]'s \"Sending Me Angels\" in 1997, and in late 2004, he was credited with playing slide guitar on [[David Lee Murphy]]'s No.&nbsp;46-peaking single \"Inspiration\", from the album ''[[Tryin' to Get There]]''.\n\n==Discography==\n{{main|Lee Roy Parnell discography}}\n\n;Studio albums\n*''[[Lee Roy Parnell (album)|Lee Roy Parnell]]'' (1990)\n*''[[Love Without Mercy]]'' (1992)\n*''[[On the Road (Lee Roy Parnell album)|On the Road]]'' (1993)\n*''[[We All Get Lucky Sometimes]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Every Night's a Saturday Night]]'' (1997)\n*''Tell the Truth'' (2001)\n*''Back to the Well'' (2006)\n*''Midnight Believer'' (2017)\n\n;Compilation albums\n*''[[Hits and Highways Ahead]]'' (1999)\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n\n*A{{anchor|endnote_A}}'''[[#ref_A|^]]''' Jed Zeppelin was an all-star group featuring [[Diamond Rio]], Lee Roy Parnell, and [[Steve Wariner]].\n\n{{refend}}\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Organization\n!Award\n!Nominee/Work\n!Result\n|-\n|1994\n|rowspan=2| [[Country Music Association Awards]]\n|[[Country Music Association Award for New Artist of the Year|Horizon Award]]\n|Lee Roy Parnell\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1995\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"[[Workin' Man Blues]]\" <small>with [[Diamond Rio]] and [[Steve Wariner]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1996\n|[[Grammy Awards]]\n|[[Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance|Best Country Instrumental Performance]]\n|\"Cat Walk\" <small>with [[Flaco Jimenez]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1997\n|Country Music Association Awards\n|Vocal Event of the Year\n|\"John the Revelator: Peace in the Valley\" <small>with [[The Fairfield Four]]</small>\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1998\n|Grammy Awards\n|Best Country Instrumental Performance\n|\"Mama, Screw Your Wig On Tight\"\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- *Cronin, Peter. \"Parnell slips into the mainstream.\" ''Billboard'' 105.46 (Nov 13, 1993): 35.\n*Flippo, Chet. \"Parnell Revisits Hits and Looks `Ahead'; Remembering Music Pioneer Anita Carter.\" ''Billboard'' 111.33 (Aug 14, 1999): 28. \n*Huey, Steve.

He was known for performing in [[the Allman Brothers Band]]. Allman grew up with an interest in [[rhythm and blues]] music, and the Allman Brothers Band fused it with rock music, [[jazz]], and [[country music|country]] at times. He wrote several of the band's most popular songs, including \"[[Whipping Post (song)|Whipping Post]]\", \"[[Melissa (The Allman Brothers Band song)|Melissa]]\", and \"[[Midnight Rider]]\". Allman also had a successful solo career, releasing seven studio albums. He was born and spent much of his childhood in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], before relocating to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] and then [[Macon, Georgia]].\n\nHe and his brother [[Duane Allman]] formed the Allman Brothers Band in 1969, which reached mainstream success with their 1971 live album ''[[At Fillmore East]]'', but shortly thereafter, Duane was killed in a motorcycle crash. The band continued, and released  ''[[Brothers and Sisters (album)|Brothers and Sisters]]'', which became their most successful album, in 1973. Allman began a solo career with ''[[Laid Back (album)|Laid Back]]'' the same year. He gained some additional fame for his 1975 to 1978 marriage to pop star [[Cher]]. He had an unexpected late-career hit with his cover of the song \"[[I'm No Angel (Bill Medley song)|I'm No Angel]]\" in 1987, and his seventh solo album, ''[[Low Country Blues]]'' (2011), saw the highest chart positions of his career. Throughout his life, Allman struggled with alcohol and substance use, which formed the basis of his memoir ''[[My Cross to Bear]]'' (2012). His final album, ''[[Southern Blood (album)|Southern Blood]]'', was released posthumously on September 8, 2017.\n\nAllman performed with a [[Hammond organ]] and guitar, and was recognized for his soulful voice. For his work in music, Allman was referred to as a [[Southern rock]] pioneer<ref>Sources:\n* {{Cite news |last=Lewis |first=Andy |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/my-cross-bear-318317 |title=My Cross to Bear |date=April 30, 2012 |work=The Hollywood Reporter |access-date=May 27, 2024}}\n* {{Cite news |last=Morris |first=Chris |url=https://variety.com/2017/music/people-news/gregg-allman-dies-dead-69-southern-rock-1202446640/ |title=Gregg Allman, Southern Rock Pioneer, Dies at 69 |date=May 27, 2024 |work=Variety |access-date=May 27, 2017}}\n* {{Cite magazine |last=Gehr |first=Richard |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/gregg-allman-southern-rock-legend-dead-at-69-w433068 |title=Gregg Allman, Southern Rock Pioneer, Dead at 69 |date=May 27, 2017 |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=May 27, 2017}}</ref> and received numerous awards, including one [[Grammy Award]]; he was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Georgia Music Hall of Fame]].

They met a man named [[Floyd Miles]], and they began to jam with his band, the Houserockers. \"I would just sit there and study Floyd ... I studied how he phrased his songs, how he got the words out, and how the other guys sang along with him\", Gregg would later recall.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=46}} They later formed their first \"real\" band, the Escorts, which performed a mix of [[top 40]] and R&B music at clubs around town.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=49}} Duane, who took the lead vocal role on early demos, encouraged his younger brother to sing instead.{{sfn|Poe|2008|p=21}} He and Duane often spent all of their money on records, as they attempted to learn songs from them. The group performed constantly as music became their entire focus; Gregg missed his high school graduation because he was performing that evening.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=50}} In his autobiography, Gregg recalls listening to Nashville R&B station [[WLAC]] at night and discovering artists such as [[Muddy Waters]], who later became central to his musical evolution.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=63}} He avoided being drafted into the [[Vietnam War]] by intentionally shooting himself in the foot.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=61}}\n\nThe Escorts evolved into [[the Allman Joys]], the brothers' first successful band.

These recordings were later released as ''Early Allman'' in 1973, to Allman's dismay.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=72}} He soon grew tired of performing covers and began writing original compositions.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=73}} They settled in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] for a time, where in the spring of 1967 they began performing alongside Johnny Sandlin and [[Paul Hornsby]], among others, under various names.

Recording was a difficult experience; \"the music had no life to it\u2014it was poppy, preprogrammed shit\", Allman felt.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=81}} Though they considered themselves [[sellouts]], they needed money to live.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=81}} At concerts, they declined to play anything off their [[Hour Glass (Hour Glass album)|debut album]], released that October, instead opting to play the blues.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=91}} Such gigs were sparse, however, as Liberty only allowed one performance per month.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=83}} After some personnel changes, they recorded their second album, ''[[Power of Love (Hour Glass album)|Power of Love]]'', released in March 1968. It contained more original songs by Allman, though they still felt constricted by its process. The band broke up when Duane explicitly told off executives at Liberty. They threatened to [[Non-compete clause|freeze the band]], so they would be unable to record for any other label for seven years.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=96}} Allman stayed behind to appease the label, giving them the rights to a solo album. The rest of the band mocked Allman, viewing him as too scared to leave and return to the South.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=96}} Meanwhile, Duane began doing session work at [[FAME Studios]] in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], where he began putting together a new band. He phoned his brother with the proposition of joining the new band\u2014which would have two guitarists and two drummers. With his deal at Liberty fulfilled, he drove to [[Jacksonville, Florida]], in March 1969 to jam with the new band.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=109}} He called the birth of the group \"one of the finer days in my life ...

In his memoir, ''My Cross to Bear'', Gregg wrote: \"I have thought of that lie every day of my life ... told him that lie, and he told me that he was sorry and that he loved me.\"{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=193}}\n\nDuane was killed in a motorcycle accident on October 29, 1971, in Macon.{{sfn|Paul|2014|p=156}} At his funeral, Gregg performed \"Melissa\", which was his brother's favorite song.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=196}} \"I tried to play and I tried to sing, but I didn't do too much writing. In the days and weeks that followed, ... I wondered if I'd ever find the passion, the energy, the love of making music\", he remembered.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=197}} As the band took some time apart to process their loss, ''At Fillmore East'' became a major success domestically. \"What we had been trying to do for all those years finally happened, and he was gone,\" Gregg remembered.{{sfn|Allman | Light|2012|p=198}} He later expanded upon his brother's passing in his memoir:\n\n{{blockquote|When I got over being angry, I prayed to him to forgive me, and I realized that my brother had a blast. ... Not that I got over it\u2014I still ain't gotten over it. I don't know what getting over it means, really. I don't stand around crying anymore, but I think about him every day of my life. ... Maybe a lot of learning how to grieve was that I had to grow up a little bit and realize that death is part of life. Now I can talk to my brother in the morning, and he answers me at night.
