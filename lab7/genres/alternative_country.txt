The band formed at [[San Marcos, Texas]] in the 1970s, and recorded several singles for \"D Records\" including the Strait-penned \"I Just Can't Go On Dying Like This\" and \"I Don't Want To Talk It Over Anymore\". After Strait attained status as the \"[[King of Country]]\", the group released an album of its own in 1995 featuring vocals from [[Darrell McCall]] and [[Mel Tillis]].\n\nThe band, originally known as \"Stoney Ridge\", performs such styles of traditional country music as [[honky-tonk]] and [[western swing]] and were influenced by such performers as [[Bob Wills]], [[Johnny Bush]], and [[The Strangers (American band)|The Strangers]].  Contemporaries of the band include [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]].\n\n==Background==\n\n===Origins===\nThe Ace in the Hole Band derived from the band \"Stoney Ridge,\" which was composed of [[Texas State University\u2013San Marcos|Southwest Texas State University]] (now Texas State) students Ron Cabal (lead [[guitar]]), Mike Daily ([[steel guitar]]), Terry Hale ([[Bass guitar]]), Tommy Foote ([[drum kit|drums]]) and Jay Dominguez (lead vocals). Dominguez and Foote left the band after graduating in 1975, prompting a search for a new singer. The band members posted bulletins around the campus of Southwest Texas.<ref name=\"texas\"/> One was noticed by an [[agricultural science]] student, George Strait. He contacted the band and was hired after an audition. Soon after, the group was renamed \"Ace in the Hole\" and George quickly became the lead singer.<ref name=\"texas\">{{cite web |url=http://ctmh.its.txstate.edu/artist.php?cmd=detail&aid=310&start=0&letter= |title=Ace in the Hole Band |author=Grant Mazak |date=2006 |work=Texas Music History Online |publisher=Texas State University |access-date=December 8, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811234143/http://ctmh.its.txstate.edu/artist.php?cmd=detail&aid=310&start=0&letter= |archive-date=August 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe band regularly performed at Cheatham Street Warehouse in [[San Marcos, Texas]], where they debuted on October&nbsp;13,&nbsp;1975 along with new member Ted Stubblefield, who temporarily replaced Foote as the drummer. Acts such as [[Asleep at the Wheel]] and [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] also played at the forum. The band appeared at the locale nearly every week until the early 1980s, when they began touring with Strait. Drummer Foote returned to the lineup late in 1975<ref name=\"texas\"/> and remained as drummer until 1983 when he relinquished his position to become the band's road manager.<ref>{{cite news|last=Corcoran|first=Michael|title=San Marcos musicians discovered Strait; the rest is country music history|url=http://straitfever.homestead.com/aceintheholeband.html|access-date=2014-05-18|newspaper=Austin American-Statesman|date=2009-09-25}}</ref> Tommy Foote died in May 2024.\n\n===Recording===\nIn 1976, [[Pappy Daily]], the grandfather of band member Mike Daily, decided to record the group for his \"D Records\" label at a studio in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. At the first session, the band recorded [[Dallas Frazier]]'s \"Honky Tonk Downstairs\" (later recorded on Strait's 1981 debut album ''[[Strait Country]]'') and the Strait-penned \"I Just Can't Go on Dying Like This\" (later recorded on Strait's 2013 album ''[[Love Is Everything (George Strait album)|Love Is Everything]]''). The songs were released to radio stations in Texas and [[Oklahoma]]. In 1977, Bill Mabry was added to the lineup as a fiddle player and the band recorded their second single, which featured the songs \"Lonesome Rodeo Cowboy\" (later recorded on Strait's 1990 album ''[[Livin' It Up (album)|Livin' It Up]]'') and \"That Don\u2019t Change the Way I Feel About You\" which was written by Strait. The next year, the band recorded the songs \"[[Right or Wrong (1921 song)|Right or Wrong]],\" and \"[[Little Liza Jane]]\",<ref name=\"texas\"/> which were later included on the 2005 D Records label release ''Complete D Singles Collection, Vol. 6: The Sounds of Houston, Texas''.<ref name=\"houston\"/> Strait re-recorded \"Right or Wrong\" in 1983 for his album ''[[Right or Wrong (George Strait album)|Right or Wrong]]'' and took it to number one on the country charts. \"The Loneliest Singer in Town\" and Strait's \"I Don\u2019t Want to Talk It Over Anymore\" also came out of this session. The three songs composed by Strait were later released on his 1995 compilation album ''[[Strait Out of the Box]]''.<ref name=\"box\">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r223204|pure_url=yes}} |title=Strait Out of the Box |author=Bruce Eder |work=Allmusic.com |access-date=December 8, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1981, after Strait signed with [[MCA Records]], the band began to tour with him and played the instrumentals on his recordings.

[[Jay Farrar]], [[Jeff Tweedy]], and [[Mike Heidorn]] formed the band after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primitives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with [[Sire Records]] and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band's major label debut album ''[[Anodyne (album)|Anodyne]]'', Farrar announced his decision to leave the band due to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo split on May 1, 1994, after completing a farewell tour. Following the breakup, Farrar formed [[Son Volt]] with Heidorn, while the remaining members continued as [[Wilco]].\n\nAlthough Uncle Tupelo broke up before it achieved commercial success, the band is renowned for its impact on the alternative country music scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/explore/essay/|title=American Alternative Rock/Post-Punk|last=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|access-date=May 31, 2006|website=[[AllMusic]]|archive-date=November 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113053923/http://allmusic.com/explore/essay|url-status=dead}}</ref> The group's first album, ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'', became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the [[hardcore punk]] of [[The Minutemen (band)|The Minutemen]] and the country instrumentation and harmony of the [[Carter Family]] and [[Hank Williams]]. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]] and the [[working class]] of Belleville.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The Plebes and The Primitives ===\n[[Jay Farrar]], along with his brothers Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=10}} Hailing from [[Belleville, Illinois]], The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited [[Jeff Tweedy]], a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=17}} Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy played an important role in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a [[rockabilly]] style, Tweedy wanted to play [[punk rock]] like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=18}}\n\nBefore leaving the band in 1984, Dade Farrar introduced its members to [[Mike Heidorn]], the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=18}}<ref name=\"liner\" /> The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, a reference to a 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=18}}<ref>The band was also known as \"The Primatives\" due to a misprint on their business cards</ref> Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the [[St. Louis]] area, The Primitives began to play [[blues]]-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed regularly at a wedding hall in [[Millstadt, Illinois]], where Tweedy's mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee.<ref name=\"liner\" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=19}} They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to [[Southern Illinois University]] and an attempted enlistment in the [[United States Army]] meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn's house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=22}} The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar, but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece.<ref name=\"liner\" /> To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named [[The Primitives]], they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo.<ref name=\"PopM\" /> Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided to take a new approach and write their own music under their new name.<ref name=\"PD\" />\n\n=== As Uncle Tupelo ===\n[[File:Uncle Tupelo poster.png|thumb|left|An early poster for an Uncle Tupelo show, in the style of Chuck Wagner's original drawing]]\nThe Primitives renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo, a name  created by combining two randomly chosen words from the dictionary. Inspired by the name, cartoonist Chuck Wagner, a friend of the band, created a character resembling an old, fat [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name=\"liner\" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=23}} The trio recorded a four-song demo tape, which got them supporting slots opening for headline artists such as [[Johnny Thunders]] and [[Warren Zevon]].<ref name=\"liner\" /> Tweedy met Tony Margherita while working as a clerk at Euclid Records in St. Louis. After attending two of the band's shows, Margherita offered to become their manager.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=25\u201326}} Uncle Tupelo began to play regular shows at Cicero's Basement \u2014 a bar close to the campus of [[Washington University in St. Louis]]. Bands playing in a similar style, including [[Brian Henneman]]'s group Chicken Truck, often played at the venue, which by late 1988 was considered the locus of a new music scene.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=29\u201330}} The band temporarily expanded to a four-piece with the addition of the guitarist Alex Mutrux, but soon reverted to a trio.<ref name=\"liner\" />\n\nUncle Tupelo recorded demo tracks in the attic studio of future Chicago punk producer Matt Allison in [[Champaign, Illinois]]. The demo, distributed with the title ''Not Forever, Just for Now'', includes \"I Got Drunk\" and \"Screen Door\", as well as early versions of several other songs that would appear on the band's first studio album.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=38}} The ''[[College Media Journal|CMJ New Music Report]]'' gave the tape a rave review, and called Uncle Tupelo the best unsigned band of the year. The accolade drew the attention of independent labels, and the band decided to sign with Jay Fialkov and Debbie Southwood-Smith of [[Giant Records (independent label)|Giant Records]], who offered to book them at [[CBGB]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pick|first=Steve|title=Uncle Tupelo: From Belleville to Rockville|newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch|date=July 5, 1990}}</ref> Explaining the decision, the band said that \"[our] original goals don't get distorted with an independent label.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Toroian|first=Diane|url=http://www.factorybelt.net/articles/giant.jpg|title=Uncle Tupelo Taking Giant Step|work=[[St. Louis Sun|The Sun]]|date=November 1989}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Recordings on Rockville Records ===\n{{Listen|filename=UTFactoryBelt.ogg|title=\"Factory Belt\"|description=The fifth track on ''No Depression'', sung by Jay Farrar.

Originally a [[Louvin Brothers]] song, [[Peter Buck]] approached the band after hearing Uncle Tupelo's version of this song performed live. It is an exemplar of the acoustic recordings found on ''March''.}}\nShortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records changed its name to Rockville Records. The band's first album for Rockville, ''[[No Depression (album)|No Depression]]'', was recorded over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. The album's thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] [[military draft]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Blackstock|first=Peter|title=Uncle Tupelo Offers Varying Takes on Small-town Life|work=[[Austin American-Statesman]]|date=January 23, 1991}}</ref> Impressed by their previous work on [[Dinosaur Jr.]]'s ''[[Bug (Dinosaur Jr album)|Bug]]'', the band wanted [[Paul Kolderie]] and [[Sean Slade]] to produce the album. Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 [[Gibson Les Paul Junior|Gibson Les Paul SG Junior]] that [[J. Mascis]] originally played on ''Bug''.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=41\u201344}} The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero's for two nights.\n\nIn between tours, Farrar, Tweedy and Heidorn formed a country cover band named Coffee Creek, along with Brian Henneman (later a member of [[The Bottle Rockets]]). Henneman impressed Uncle Tupelo, and he was invited to be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist for the band.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=48\u201349}} While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=51\u201353}}\n\nBy March 1991, ''No Depression'' had sold an estimated 15,000 copies, and was featured in a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' article about rising stars.<ref name=\"liner\" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=52}} However, Rockville Records refused to pay the band any royalties for the album, a theme that would continue for the remainder of the band's contract.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=52}} Over seventeen days the band recorded a second album at [[Long View Farm]] in rural [[North Brookfield, Massachusetts]]. ''[[Still Feel Gone]]'', with a more layered sound, was also produced by Kolderie and Slade, with contributions by Slade, Henneman, Rich Gilbert, Chris Bess of Enormous Richard, and [[Gary Louris]] of [[The Jayhawks]]. The band was disappointed with the production of the album and decided to discontinue working with Kolderie and Slade.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=58}} Soon afterward, Uncle Tupelo recorded \"Shaking Hands (Soldier's Joy)\" on [[Michelle Shocked]]'s album ''[[Arkansas Traveler (Michelle Shocked album)|Arkansas Traveler]]'' and joined her on the accompanying tour with [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]] and [[The Band]]. However, the tour only lasted for a few shows because of managerial problems between Shocked and The Band.<ref name=\"last\" /><ref>{{cite news|last=Morse|first=Steve|title=Shocked's Show Goes on, Despite Disputes|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=October 8, 1992}}</ref><ref name=\"CST\" />\n\n[[Alternative rock]] had broken into the mainstream by 1992, and an album released in that style was expected to earn the group a major-label record deal. However, Uncle Tupelo did not want to follow in the footsteps of groups such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and decided to play [[country music|country]] and [[folk song]]s \"as a big 'fuck you' to the rock scene\".{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=59\u201360}}{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=66}} [[Peter Buck]], guitarist for [[R.E.M.]], saw the trio perform at the [[40 Watt Club]] in [[Athens, Georgia]] and sought them out after the show. Buck was impressed with a version of \"Atomic Power\" that the band played, and offered his services for their next album. Over a span of five days, Buck produced the group's next album, ''[[March 16\u201320, 1992]]''.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=61}} Buck allowed them to stay in his house during the sessions, and charged no money for his services. Henneman's role was increased for this album, and he taught himself how to play [[mandolin]] and [[bouzouki]].{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=63}} Despite turning away from the style of popular alternative rock, major labels began to show significant interest in Uncle Tupelo after ''March 16\u201320, 1992'' was released.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=66}} The album sold more than their two previous recordings combined, although Rockville was displeased that it did not conform to the style of popular alternative rock.<ref>{{cite news|last=Eichenberger|first=Bill|title=Life's All Right; Uncle Tupelo Kicks Back, Adds Acoustic Touch and Sings Great Songs|work=[[Columbus Dispatch]]|date=March 1, 1994}}</ref>\n\n=== Major label contract ===\nIn 1992, Joe McEwen of [[Sire Records]] began to pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr. and [[Shawn Colvin]] to Sire, had been interested in them since hearing the ''Not Forever, Just for Now'' demo tape. At the urging of [[Gary Louris]], McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums and specified a budget of $150,000 for the first.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=71\u201373}}\n\nAround the time of the recording of ''March 16\u201320, 1992'', Mike Heidorn had secured a steady job at a Belleville newspaper company and was dating a woman who had two children from a previous marriage. Uncle Tupelo had planned a tour of Europe, but Heidorn wanted to stay in Belleville with his girlfriend, whom he married in August 1992.<ref name=\"CST\" />{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=69}}\n\nThe band held auditions prior to the promotional tour for ''March 16\u201320, 1992'', and two candidates stood out: Bill Belzer and [[Ken Coomer]]. Although Farrar and Tweedy agreed that Coomer was the better drummer, they were intimidated by his six-foot-four stature and long [[dreadlocks]]. The band instead selected Belzer as Heidorn's replacement, but he only stayed with the band for six months.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=73}} Tweedy explained Belzer's departure:{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=74}}\n\n<blockquote>I want to believe it was purely musical, and I honestly believe that it wasn't working musically. I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a [[gay]] person at that point in our lives&nbsp;... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.</blockquote>\n\nAfter touring Europe opening for [[Sugar (American band)|Sugar]], the band replaced Belzer with Coomer. The band also experimented with new members: [[John Stirratt]] replaced Brian Henneman (who left to form The Bottle Rockets) while [[Max Johnston (musician)|Max Johnston]], the brother of Michelle Shocked, joined as a live mandolin and [[violin]] performer. Stirratt became the full-time bassist, allowing Tweedy to perform more songs with the guitar.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=75}}\n\nNow a five-piece, Uncle Tupelo recorded their major label debut at Cedar Creek studio in [[Austin, Texas]] in early 1993. ''[[Anodyne (album)|Anodyne]]'' consisted of live-in-the-studio recordings and included a duet with Farrar and [[Doug Sahm]] of the [[Sir Douglas Quintet]].{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=78}} The album sold 150,000 copies, and was their only entry on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=79\u201380}}<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Heatseekers|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=October 10, 1993}}</ref> The group toured until the end of the year, finishing with a sold-out concert at Tramps in New York City. Because of their concert draw, major executives at Sire began to see the band as a potential hit.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=79\u201380}}\n\nIn 1993, the band contributed a cover of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s track \"Effigy\" to the AIDS-Benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\n=== Breakup ===\nWith the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of ''Anodyne'', Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled:{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=77}}\n\n<blockquote>Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore.</blockquote>\n\nTweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Llewellyn|first=Kati|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/35152-jay-farrar-speaks-extensively-about-uncle-tupelos-breakup |title=Jay Farrar Speaks Extensively About Uncle Tupelo's Breakup|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=September 8, 2005 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080308083824/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/35152-jay-farrar-speaks-extensively-about-uncle-tupelos-breakup |archive-date = March 8, 2008}} Last accessed June 8, 2007.</ref> In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band.

The following day, the two engaged in a verbal confrontation.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=82\u201383}} As a favor to Margherita, who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running, Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=82\u201383}} The band made its first appearance on national television during the tour when they were featured on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''. Sire had requested that the band perform \"The Long Cut\" on the show, which further irked Farrar since the song was written and sung by Tweedy.\n\nUncle Tupelo's last concerts, two shows at [[The Blue Note (Columbia, Missouri)|The Blue Note]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]] and two shows at [[Mississippi Nights]] in [[St. Louis]], took place from April 28 to May 1, 1994. A special \"last leg\" poster was created for the occasion which facetiously promoted the band as \"St. Louis's 4th best country band\", based on a readers' poll in the [[Riverfront Times]]. On the last night, Tweedy and Farrar each performed nine songs during the concert, and Mike Heidorn performed as drummer during the encore.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=84\u221285}}\n\n=== Post-breakup ===\n{{further|Son Volt|Wilco}}\nFollowing Uncle Tupelo's final tour, Tweedy encouraged his bandmates to join him in a new group, while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own. Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle Tupelo lineup, and created [[Wilco]]. They began rehearsing a few days after the final Uncle Tupelo concert, and by August 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album, ''[[A.M. (Wilco album)|A.M.]]''. Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band, [[Son Volt]]; Boquist was a multi-instrumentalist who had performed with [[Joe Henry]] as the opening act on Uncle Tupelo's last tour. Boquist also recruited his brother Dave, and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave Belleville to join the group. Farrar's new four-piece began recording their debut album ''[[Trace (Son Volt album)|Trace]]'' in November 1994.{{sfn|Kot|2004|pp=89\u201390}}\n\nWilco signed to [[Reprise Records]] while Son Volt signed with [[Warner Bros.

In 2003, Uncle Tupelo re-issued their first three albums, which before the lawsuit had cumulatively sold over 200,000 copies.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=72}}\n\n== Influences ==\nAs The Primitives, Tweedy and Farrar were highly influenced by punk bands such as [[The Ramones]] and [[The Sex Pistols]]. However, they began to listen to country music because punk rock was not well received in the Belleville and St. Louis music scenes. While they originally were introduced to country by their parents, it was not until this time that they began to listen to it for leisure.{{sfn|Kot|2004|p=19}}<ref name=\"NYT\" /> Farrar typically wrote songs about [[Middle America (US)|Middle America]], while Tweedy wrote about more mainstream topics such as relationships.

Known as \"The King of Juke Joint Swing,\"{{cn|date=July 2023}} his performances incorporate [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[western swing]], [[Country music|country]] and [[rockabilly]], styles of music that he began listening to as a kid. His influences include [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]], [[Glenn Miller]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], [[Hank Williams]] and [[Hank Snow]] because they were all in his parents' record collection.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://turnstyledjunkpiled.com/2018/10/31/waynethetrain/|title=Wayne 'The Train' Hancock: Man of the Road|work=TJ Music Magazine|access-date=November 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his childhood, Hancock moved around seven times because his father was a [[Design engineer]] who worked at various engineering firms around the United States. Shortly after discovering [[country music]], Hancock began writing songs at the age of twelve. Hancock's vocal style was initially influenced by [[Hank Williams]], and he has been compared to him throughout his career.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt eighteen years old, Hancock won the Wrangler [[Country Showdown]] contest. The son of a [[WWII]] veteran, Hancock joined the [[United States Marine Corps]] immediately after winning the contest and was shipped to [[recruit training]]. Hancock served in the military for four years. During a six-month deployment at [[Camp Hansen]] in [[Okinawa, Japan]], he wrote one of his most well known songs, \"Cold Lonesome Wind\" from ''[[Thunderstorms and Neon Signs]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1990, Hancock moved to [[Austin, Texas]]. In 1994, he met [[Lubbock, Texas]] native [[Joe Ely]], a member of the [[The Flatlanders|Flatlanders]] at the [[Continental Club]] in, Austin, Texas. Shortly thereafter, Hancock landed a role in [[Terry Allen (artist)|Terry Allen]] and [[Jo Harvey Allen]]'s play, [[Chippy (album)|Chippy]]. [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]] of the Flatlanders originally played Hancock's character Mr. Jukebox. When Gilmore was unable to do the second run of the play, Ely brought Hancock in, saying \"This guy sounds just like [[Hank Williams]], he'd be perfect.\" From there, Hancock joined the cast and went into the studio to record \"Thunderstorms and Neon Signs,\" for the soundtrack. It was his first recording of the song.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHancock met [[Grammy Award]] winning producer, [[Pedal steel guitar|pedal steel]] player, and [[Lubbock, Texas]] native, [[Lloyd Maines]] when Maines was running sound for [[Chippy (album)|Chippy]]. [[Lloyd Maines|Maines]] has produced all of Hancock's albums, dating back to his 1995 debut, ''[[Thunderstorms and Neon Signs]]'', released on Deja Disc Records. The album sold 22,000 copies in the first year. The follow-up was Hancock's sophomore 1997 album, ''[[That's What Daddy Wants]]'' released on [[Ark 21]]. Hancock gained the nickname The Train because of his marathon length shows, going on for 3, 4, even 5 hours long.\"\n\nOn his debut 1999 album, ''[[Risin' Outlaw]]'', [[Hank Williams III]], grandson of [[Hank Williams|Hank Williams Sr.]], covered two songs from ''[[Thunderstorms and Neon Signs]]'', the title track, and \"Why Don't You Leave Me Alone.\" He also recorded \"87 Southbound,\" from ''[[That's What Daddy Wants]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn April 2014, Hancock was involved in a serious motorcycle accident, which left him with a fractured elbow and a collapsed lung. He was forced to cancel several months' worth of tour dates due to the wreck, but by the end of the year he was fully recovered and back on the road. In 2016, Hancock returned to the studio with producer [[Lloyd Maines]] to cut his eighth studio album Slingin' Rhythm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wayne-hancock-mn0000243418/biography|title=Wayne Hancock {{!}} Biography & History|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=July 3, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Discography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Album details\n! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller;\"\n! width=\"65\"| [[Top Country Albums|US Country]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Thunderstorms and Neon Signs]]''\n| \n* Release date: September 19, 1995\n* Label: Deja Disc\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[That's What Daddy Wants]]''\n| \n* Release date: August 26, 1997\n* Label: [[Ark 21 Records]]\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Thunderstorms and Neon Signs]]''\n| \n* Release date: March 24, 1998\n* Label: Ark 21 Records\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Wild, Free & Reckless]]''\n| \n* Release date: July 27, 1999\n* Label: Ark 21 Records\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''The South Austin Sessions''\n| \n* Release date: September 1, 2001\n* Label: [[Bloodshot Records]]\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[A-Town Blues]]''\n| \n* Release date: September 4, 2001\n* Label: Bloodshot Records\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Swing Time''\n| \n* Release date: August 19, 2003\n* Label: Bloodshot Records\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''The Best of Wayne Hancock''\n| \n* Release date: April 26, 2005\n* Label: Ark 21 Records\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Tulsa''\n| \n* Release date: October 10, 2006\n* Label: Bloodshot Records\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''[[Viper of Melody]]''\n| \n* Release date: April 21, 2009\n* Label: Bloodshot Records\n| \u2014\n|-\n! scope=\"row\"| ''Ride''\n| \n* Release date: February 25, 2013\n* Label: Bloodshot Records\n| 68\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | ''Slingin' Rhythm''\n| \n* Release date: October 28, 2016\n* Label: Bloodshot Records\n| \u2014\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" style=\"font-size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.waynehancock.com}}\n* [https://www.facebook.com/train.viper Official Facebook]\n* [https://twitter.com/Wayne_The_Train Official Twitter]\n* [{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p168266/biography|pure_url=yes}} Wayne Hancock on Allmusic]\n* {{IMDb name|2685436}}\n* [http://www.rockabilly.net/articles/wayne.shtml Wayne Hancock on rockabilly.net]\n* [https://archive.org/details/WayneHancock Wayne Hancock collection] at the [[Internet Archive]]'s live music archive\n* http://www.austinchronicle.com/music/2014-05-09/playback-headhunters-closes/\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hancock, Wayne}}\n[[Category:1965 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American alternative country singers]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Singers from Austin, Texas]]\n[[Category:Bloodshot Records artists]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Texas]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Texas]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

He cut off contact with Elektra and refused to give them any material after the release of ''Sound & Fury''. Simpson claimed that Elektra \"[did not] know what the fuck to do\" with him, as he created ''Sound & Fury'' to be difficult to market, and left Elektra with a \"giant un-recouped debt\" upwards of a million dollars from costs relating to the album's companion film, which was similarly hard to promote.

Fronted by [[Ryan Adams]], the group included members [[Caitlin Cary]], [[Phil Wandscher]], Eric \"Skillet\" Gilmore, and [[Mike Daly]]. They disbanded in 2000 with Adams leaving to pursue his solo career. Whiskeytown gradually expanded its sound outside the confines of alternative country while still maintaining its alternative roots.\n\nThe band released three albums. No two albums shared a consistent lineup; Adams and Cary remained the only constants.\n\n== History ==\nAfter performing punk rock with a band called The Patty Duke Syndrome, Adams founded Whiskeytown in 1994 in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. The music of country-rock artist [[Gram Parsons]] served as his inspiration. The band initially consisted of Adams, violinist [[Caitlin Cary]], drummer Eric \"Skillet\" Gilmore, bassist Steve Grothmann and guitarist [[Phil Wandscher]].<ref name=Guardian2001>{{cite news |title='I'm not a star to myself.

Among the bonus tracks were previously unreleased tracks and tracks that had been released on earlier albums and EPs, including ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'' and ''[[Rural Free Delivery (EP)|Rural Free Delivery]]''. One track, \"Oklahoma,\" was removed. Adams claimed that the reason for the re-release was the muddy sound of the original version and his distaste for \"Oklahoma,\" which was added to the album despite his objections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435210/09011998/whiskeytown.jhtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040521063536/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1435210/09011998/whiskeytown.jhtml |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 21, 2004 |title=News \u2013 Articles \u2013 1435210 |publisher=Mtv.com |date=September 1, 1998 |access-date=July 6, 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Strangers Almanac'' era (1997\u20131998) ===\nWhiskeytown's 1997 major-label debut, ''[[Strangers Almanac]]'', helped to establish Adams' reputation as a songwriter. In the midst of the album's recording, Gilmore and Grothman left, and Wandscher left soon after the album's release. The band cycled through numerous members throughout the next year, including [[Jeff Rice]] and Steven Terry, both of whom were involved in the recording of ''Almanac'' but left later that year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}\n\nThe band's reputation preceded it in the live setting.

The traditional country of the first two albums, especially ''Faithless'', was largely replaced with a more sophisticated country-rooted pop sound, very similar to [[Wilco]]'s 1999 album ''[[Summerteeth]]''. Also adding to the different flavor of the album was a cast of guest stars, including [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]]' [[Tommy Stinson]] and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]' [[James Iha]].\n\nDespite the album's completion and Whiskeytown's sizable fanbase, Outpost Records closed during the merger between Polygram and Universal, and as a result the album stayed in limbo for nearly two years, effectively ending the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2000-12-21/music/swan-song/2|title=Swan Song \u2013 Page 2 \u2013 Music \u2013 Phoenix \u2013 Phoenix New Times|first=Bill|last= Holdship|date=December 21, 2000|access-date=January 3, 2011|publisher=[[Phoenix New Times]]}}</ref>\n\n[[Lost Highway Records]], the roots-minded label imprint of [[Universal Music]], picked up the album after signing Adams (who, in the interim, recorded his highly acclaimed debut solo record ''[[Heartbreaker (Ryan Adams album)|Heartbreaker]]'' on indie label [[Bloodshot Records]]) and released it in May 2001 [{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r532907|pure_url=yes}}].\n\n=== Post-Whiskeytown and talk of reunion ===\nSince the band dissolved, most core members have chosen to remain active in music.

She won awards in national fiddle championships while still a teenager. Maguire is accomplished on several other instruments, including the mandolin, viola, double bass and guitar. She has written and co-written a number of the band's songs, some of which have become chart-topping hits. She also contributes her skills in vocal harmony and backing vocals, as well as orchestrating string arrangements for the band.\n\nMaguire learned several instruments at a young age, honing her skills with her younger sister, [[Emily Strayer]] (born Emily Erwin) and two schoolmates (a brother and sister team, Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]) for over five years as a part of a touring bluegrass quartet while in high school. After graduation, the sisters forged an alliance with two other women they had met through the Dallas music scene, [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]] and Robin Lynn Macy, forming a bluegrass and country music band, [[busking]] and touring the bluegrass festival circuits for six years. After the departure of Macy, and the replacement of Lynch with singer [[Natalie Maines]], the band widened their musical repertoire and appearance. The result was a trio so commercially successful that it took the country music industry by surprise, with 19 singles hitting the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Charts]], 2 Diamond Albums, 2 Platinum albums, and 13 [[Grammy Awards]].  Maguire subsequently stood by her bandmates as they were engulfed in a 2003 controversy for [[Dixie Chicks controversy|criticizing George W. Bush]], which led to the Chicks being [[blacklisted]] by many country radio stations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Tyrangiel |first1=Josh |title=Chicks in the Line of Fire |url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1196419,00.html |access-date=October 5, 2022 |publisher=Time Magazine |date=May 21, 2006}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMartha Elenor Erwin, nicknamed Martie, was born October 12, 1969, in [[York, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"TV guide\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/martie-maguire/256027 |title=Martie Maguire News, Martie Maguire Bio and Photos |publisher=TVGuide.com |access-date=2014-07-15}}</ref>\n\nEncouraged by her parents &ndash; educators at private schools &ndash; Maguire began playing violin at age five, and by age 12, started to learn to play \"[[fiddle]] style\" after receiving a birthday gift of fiddle lessons.<ref name=\"Ladies Home Journal\">[http://www.lhj.com/lhj/story.jhtml?storyid=/templatedata/lhj/story/data/martiemaguirecelebprofile_01132003.xml]{{dead link|date=July 2014}}</ref> She also was active in her school orchestra.<ref name=\"Gilchriest\">[http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219045902/http://www.freewebs.com/originalchicks/newsarchive.htm|date=December 19, 2007}}</ref>\n\nHer sister Emily shared her love and interest in music, and displayed early talent herself.

Strayer plays [[banjo]], [[dobro]], guitar, lap steel, [[Upright bass|bass]], [[mandolin]], [[accordion]], [[fiddle]], [[piano]], and [[sitar]]. Initially in her career with the Chicks, she limited her singing to harmony with backing vocals, but within her role in the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]], she took on the role of lead vocalist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nEmily Erwin was born in [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]]. Parents Paul Erwin and Barbara Trask moved the family to the suburban town of [[Addison, Texas]], on the northern edge of [[Dallas]], where she was raised with her two older sisters, Julia and [[Martie Maguire|Martha]]. Her parents were both educators and nurtured the growing interest that both Emily and Martha (later nicknamed Martie) shared, and together both sisters became proficient on several instruments while in elementary school.\n\nEmily began playing the violin at age seven, and the [[banjo]] at age ten, afterward learning all the [[string instruments]] she could find.<ref name=\"Malkin\">Malkin, Nina [http://chickoholic.tripod.com/DixieChicks/id8.html \"A Little About Martie\"], Dixie Chicks Henhouse (Retrieved December 31, 2007).</ref> Years later, Martie joked that Emily was better than she at the fiddle, and because she wanted to keep the fiddle as her instrument, she forced Emily to learn something else.<ref>{{cite video | title=[[Dixie Chicks: Shut Up and Sing]] |date=2006 | medium=Motion picture |publisher=[[The Weinstein Company]]}}</ref> Emily responded by mastering the five string banjo, by reading books to teach herself the [[chord progressions]].<ref name=\"Malkin\"/>\n\nFrom 1984\u20131989, Jane Frost (Director of the [[Patsy Montana|Patsy Montana Museum]] and the [[Walnut Valley Festival]] in [[Winfield, Kansas]]) remembers watching the sisters mature, teaming up with schoolmates Troy and [[Sharon Gilchrist]]. The foursome were touring in a teenage [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] group they named the Blue Night Express, in part because of the amount of traveling they had to do to reach far away festivals, frequently with a parent or friend of the family towing them back home long after dark at night. They thought it was worth the sacrifices to meet their musical heroes and experienced the friendly camaraderie and tricks of the trade on instruments from others. The sisters were said to have an \"almost obsessive\" interest in [[busking]] at small venues and attending bluegrass festivals.<ref name=Frost>{{cite web|last1=Frost|first1=Jane|title=Walnut Valley Festival in Winfield, KS, Early 1980s|url=http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml|website=The All-Inclusive Dixie Chicks Page|date=July 15, 1999|access-date=December 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002233114/http://www.dixie-chicks.com/stories.shtml|archive-date=October 2, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"Faraway Hills\">[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html \"Sharon Gilchrist\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303182257/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/farawayhills/sharon_gilchrist.html |date=March 3, 2016 }}, Faraway Hills (Retrieved February 12, 2008).</ref> After Martie graduated from secondary school at [[Greenhill School (Addison, Texas)|Greenhill School]] with Emily still completing her studies, both remained active in the bluegrass scene.\n\n==The Chicks==\n[[File:Emily Robison with the Dixie Chicks 1998.jpg|thumb|200px|left|With the Dixie Chicks; 1998]]\n\nIn 1989, after years of attending [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[festivals]] and [[busking]] where they could, Emily joined her sister Martie, guitarist Robin Lynn Macy, and [[upright bass]] player [[Laura Lynch (musician)|Laura Lynch]]. Frost, again, recalls being privy to the discussion that the four women had about the possibility of a successful career as musicians together. Martie felt they could do well. Robin said, \".. It's going to be a 'hot' band,\" to which Emily responded, \"I give it six months, and if we aren't making money by then, I'm out of here!\".<ref name=\"Frost\" /> Strayer was shy, and the youngest member of the group.

Macy left the group for a \"purer\" [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] sound. Lynch, thrust into the position of sole lead singer, was replaced by the sisters in 1995 with singer composer [[Natalie Maines]] after the group was unable to garner anything more than local interest.<ref name=\"Dickerson\">Dickerson, James L.

We know that we will always be playing music together, so we wanted to find someone who is just as determined and energetic as we are.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nBut in later interviews, the sisters revealed what many had thought for a long time: the reason Lynch was replaced was not commitment but a perceived lack of talent.  In an article in the April/May edition of ''Country Music Magazine'', Emily stated, \"We felt we needed the next calibre of singer.\"{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[File:Emily-Robison.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Strayer in concert with the [[Dixie Chicks]], Austin, Texas, 2006]]\n\nFrom there, massive commercial success ensued, with their 1998 and 1999 albums ''[[Wide Open Spaces (album)|Wide Open Spaces]]'' and  ''[[Fly (Dixie Chicks album)|Fly]]'' both achieving [[diamond record]] status. Strayer was a key element of the group's look, with her hair dyed blond to match the other two at first, and then allowing it to return to her natural brunette color, and distinguishing herself visually from the other two. Strayer and Maguire's instrumental virtuosity set the Dixie Chicks apart from many other country acts, male and female. Strayer's songwriting has also been a factor in the Chicks' recording career. <!-- needs expansion, reference to particular songs -->\n\nStrayer stood by Maines when the controversy over Maines' remarks about U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] hit the newswire on the eve before the [[Iraq War]] in 2003. She was the only bandmate to realize that - while in the U.K., there was a big anti-war sentiment in the audience - back in the United States, Maines' criticism of President Bush would not be well received. Nevertheless, even when her home was trashed,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} and plenty of editorials were predicting the end of the Dixie Chicks' successful careers in music, she remained loyal to Maines, as did her sister.\n<!-- needs expansion, reference regarding the success of the Chicks in general -->\n\n==Court Yard Hounds==\n[[File:Emily-Robison 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Strayer with the [[Court Yard Hounds (band)|Court Yard Hounds]] at Antone's, [[SXSW]], March 18, 2010]]\nStrayer spent at least half of her life busking and touring nearly non-stop since high school, first with her older sister, and then with the changing lineups of the Dixie Chicks. After the bandmates celebrated their five [[Grammy Award]]s for ''[[Taking the Long Way]]'', the trio all had young children and took time out to spend with them, but Strayer was eager to return to writing and touring. When Strayer's marriage came to an end, she began expressing herself by songwriting.
