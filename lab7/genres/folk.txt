The eight band members, all from the Leahy family of 11 siblings, are from [[Lakefield, Ontario]] and have been touring Canada and internationally since the early 1980s, when they were known as '''The Leahy Family'''. In 1985, they were the subject of a short film entitled ''Leahy: Music Most of All'' which received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in the category of \"Best Foreign Student Film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/saa/winners/winners.pdf |title=Student Film Award Winners -- By Year |publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229173821/http://www.oscars.org/awards/saa/winners/winners.pdf |archivedate=February 29, 2012 }}</ref>\nThe members of Leahy take significant pride in their Irish roots and Canadian upbringing.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://irishamerica.com/2006/10/leahy-staying-true-to-the-tune/ | title=Leahy: Staying True to the Tune | date=October 2006 }}</ref>\n\nThe line-up of the group varies depending upon the availability of its members, who are present or absent due to marriage, childrearing and other obligations. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the band recorded a number of privately released LPs and cassettes (most of which used the same title, ''The Leahy Family'') which were sold at their concerts and they were frequent guests at the [[Big Valley Jamboree]] concerts in [[Saskatchewan]] and [[Alberta]].\n\nIn 1997, the band resumed recording with their \"relaunch\" album, ''[[Leahy (album)|Leahy]]'' which also introduced the group's new branding. ''Leahy'' was an instrumental album, but the band also includes vocal performances in their live performances and subsequent albums have included both vocals and instrumentals.\n\nDespite their established history, they were awarded two [[Juno Awards of 1998|Juno awards in 1998]], for [[Juno Award for New Group of the Year|Best New Group]]<ref name=\"Inc.1998\">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=McLaughlin at top of Juno nominations|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQ8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14|date=21 February 1998|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=14\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and [[Juno Award for Instrumental Album of the Year|Best Instrumental Artist]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://junoawards.ca/database/artist-summary/?artist_name=leahy |title=(Juno Awards Database Lookup) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723180613/http://junoawards.ca/database/artist-summary/?artist_name=leahy |archivedate=2011-07-23 }}</ref>  The following year, Leahy took a third Juno Award, for [[Juno Award for Country Recording of the Year|Best Country Group or Duo]]. Also in 1998, Leahy were added as the opening act for Canadian country singer [[Shania Twain]]'s 1998 [[Come on Over Tour]] and were featured in two television specials from the tour, ''[[Live (Shania Twain DVD)|Live]]'' and ''[[The Specials (Shania Twain DVD)|The Specials]]'', performing with Twain on the song \"[[Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)]]\".<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=The Specials (Winter Break / Come On Over) |others=[[Shania Twain]] |year=2001 |url=https://www.amazon.com/Shania-Twain-Specials-Winter-Break/dp/product-description/B00005RIIO |at=Back Cover |type=DVD |publisher=Mercury |id=B00005RIIO |location=Nashville }}</ref>\n\nThe group's members are both instrumentalists and dancers, with several members skilled in fiddle-playing (most notably the band's most famous member, Donnell). The female members of the band often perform [[step-dancing]]-style routines and do most of the singing.\n\n==Members==\n[[File:Leahy.jpg|thumb|Leahy in concert at the Fergus Scottish Festival in 2009]]\nAll members of the band are siblings.

Kramer in Latham, Sean (ed.), 2021, ''The World of Bob Dylan'', pp. 251\u2013263.</ref>\n\nDylan was born and raised in [[St. Louis County, Minnesota]]. Following [[Bob Dylan (album)|his self-titled debut album]] of traditional [[Folk-songs|folk songs]] in 1962, he made his breakthrough with ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'' (1963). The album featured \"[[Blowin' in the Wind]]\" and \"[[A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall]]\", which adapted the tunes and phrasing of older folk songs. He released the politically charged ''[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (Bob Dylan album)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]'' and the more lyrically abstract and introspective ''[[Another Side of Bob Dylan]]'' in 1964. In 1965 and 1966, Dylan [[Electric Dylan controversy|drew controversy]] among folk purists when he adopted [[Amplifier|electrically amplified]] rock instrumentation, and in the space of 15 months recorded three of the most influential rock albums of the 1960s: ''[[Bringing It All Back Home]]'', ''[[Highway 61 Revisited]]'' and ''[[Blonde on Blonde]]''. When Dylan made his move from acoustic folk and blues music to rock, the mix became more complex. His six-minute single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\" (1965) expanded commercial and creative boundaries in popular music.<ref name=LARS>{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-20110516| title=500 Greatest Songs Of All Time| date=April 7, 2011| access-date=January 6, 2020|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]| archive-date=October 31, 2019| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031103816/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-151127/bob-dylan-like-a-rolling-stone-2-54028/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last=Rogovoy|first=Seth| title=How Bob Dylan's greatest song changed music history \u2014 a deep-dive into an accidental masterpiece| url=https://forward.com/culture/475865/how-bob-dylans-greatest-song-changed-music-history-a-deep-dive-into-an/| date=September 27, 2021| access-date=September 30, 2021| url-status=live| archive-date=September 28, 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210928170718/https://forward.com/culture/475865/how-bob-dylans-greatest-song-changed-music-history-a-deep-dive-into-an/| quote=Bruce Springsteen, who was originally touted as a 'new Dylan' when he was signed to Columbia Records, Dylan's label, by the same label honcho, John Hammond, who signed Dylan, said this about 'Like a Rolling Stone':<br />'Dylan freed your mind and showed us that because the music was physical did not mean it was anti-intellect. He had the vision and talent to make a pop song so that it contained the whole world. He invented a new way a pop singer could sound, broke through the limitations of what a recording could achieve, and he changed the face of rock 'n' roll for ever and ever.'| publisher=[[The Forward]]}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1966, a motorcycle accident led to Dylan's withdrawal from touring. During this period, he recorded [[List of Basement Tapes songs|a large body of songs]] with members of [[the Band]], who had previously backed him on tour. These recordings were later released as ''[[The Basement Tapes]]'' in 1975. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dylan explored [[country music]] and rural themes on ''[[John Wesley Harding]]'' (1967), ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' (1969) and ''[[New Morning]]'' (1970). In 1975, he released ''[[Blood on the Tracks]]'', which many saw as a return to form. In the late 1970s, he became a [[Born again|born-again Christian]] and released three albums of contemporary [[gospel music]] before returning to his more familiar rock-based idiom in the early 1980s. Dylan's [[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|''Time Out of Mind'']] (1997) marked the beginning of a career renaissance. He has released five critically acclaimed albums of original material since, most recently ''[[Rough and Rowdy Ways]]'' (2020). He also recorded a trilogy of albums covering the [[Great American Songbook]], especially songs sung by [[Frank Sinatra]], and an album smoothing his early rock material into a mellower [[Americana (music)|Americana]] sensibility, ''[[Shadow Kingdom]]'' (2023). Dylan has toured continuously since the late 1980s on what has become known as the [[Never Ending Tour]].<ref>Heylin, Clinton, 2011, ''Bob Dylan: Behind The Shades, The 20th Anniversary Edition'', pp. 646\u2013652.</ref>\n\nSince 1994, Dylan has published [[Bob Dylan bibliography#Art books by Bob Dylan|nine books of paintings and drawings]], and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.

Shelton surmises that Dillon had two sources: [[Matt Dillon (Gunsmoke)|Marshal Matt Dillon]] was the hero of the TV western ''[[Gunsmoke]]''; Dillon was also the name of one of Hibbing's principal families. While Shelton was writing Dylan's biography in the 1960s, Dylan told him, \"Straighten out in your book that I did not take my name from Dylan Thomas. Dylan Thomas's poetry is for people that aren't really satisfied in their bed, for people who dig masculine romance.\" At the University of Minnesota, Dylan told a few friends that Dillon was his mother's maiden name, which was untrue. He later told reporters that he had an uncle named Dillon. Shelton added that only when he reached New York in 1961 did he begin to spell his name \"Dylan\", by which time he was acquainted with the life and work of Dylan Thomas. Shelton (2011), pp. 44\u201345.</ref> In a 2004 interview, he said, \"You're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. I mean, that happens. You call yourself what you want to call yourself.

In January 1961, he traveled to New York City to perform and visit his musical idol [[Woody Guthrie]]<ref>Sounes, p. 72</ref> at [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]].<ref>Dylan, p. 98.</ref> Guthrie had been a revelation to Dylan and influenced his early performances.

[[Janet Maslin]] wrote of ''Freewheelin{{'}}'': <blockquote>These were the songs that established [Dylan] as the voice of his generation\u2014someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about [[nuclear disarmament]] and the growing [[Civil Rights Movement]]: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes.<ref>Maslin, Janet in Miller, Jim (ed.) (1981), ''The Rolling Stone History of Rock & Roll'', 1981, p. 220</ref><ref group=\"a\">The title \"Spokesman of a Generation\" was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came to feel it was a label the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, ''[[Chronicles, Volume One|Chronicles]]'', Dylan wrote: \"The press never let up. Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an interview so they wouldn't beat the door down.

I felt like a piece of meat that someone had thrown to the dogs.\" Dylan (2004), p.119</ref></blockquote> ''Freewheelin{{'}}'' also included love songs and surreal [[talking blues]]. Humor was an important part of Dylan's persona,<ref>Scaduto, p. 35.</ref> and the range of material on the album impressed listeners, including [[the Beatles]]. [[George Harrison]] said of the album: \"We just played it, just wore it out. The content of the song lyrics and just the attitude\u2014it was incredibly original and wonderful\".<ref>''Mojo'' magazine, December 1993. p. 97</ref>\n\nThe rough edge of Dylan's singing unsettled some but attracted others. Author [[Joyce Carol Oates]] wrote: \"When we first heard this raw, very young, and seemingly untrained voice, frankly nasal, as if sandpaper could sing, the effect was dramatic and electrifying\".<ref>Hedin, p. 259.</ref> Many early songs reached the public through more palatable versions by other performers, such as [[Joan Baez]], who became Dylan's advocate and lover.<ref>Sounes, pp. 136\u2013138.</ref> Baez was influential in bringing Dylan to prominence by recording several of his early songs and inviting him on stage during her concerts.<ref>Joan Baez entry, Gray (2006), pp. 28\u201331.</ref> Others who had hits with Dylan's songs in the early 1960s included [[the Byrds]], [[Sonny & Cher]], [[the Hollies]], [[the Association]], [[Manfred Mann]] and [[the Turtles]].\n\n\"[[Mixed-Up Confusion]]\", recorded during the ''Freewheelin''' sessions with a backing band, was released as Dylan's first single in December 1962, but then swiftly withdrawn. In contrast to the mostly solo acoustic performances on the album, the single showed a willingness to experiment with a [[rockabilly]] sound. [[Cameron Crowe]] described it as \"a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards Elvis Presley and [[Sun Records]]\".<ref>[[Biograph (album)|''Biograph'']], 1985, Liner notes & text by [[Cameron Crowe]].

In his teens, he decided upon a career as a [[rodeo]] rider. Recovering from injuries sustained from a fall during the mid-1950s, he started learning guitar. In the late 1950s, he relocated to Toronto, aspiring to a career as a commercial artist. He also started playing clubs and coffeehouses in Toronto.<ref name=\"ch\">{{cite web|url=http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000752|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051205043718/http://tceplus.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0000752|url-status=dead|title=Coffeehouses|archive-date=December 5, 2005}}</ref> By 1959 he was performing music as a full-time occupation.\n\n[[Sylvia Tyson]], n\u00e9e Fricker, CM, was born in Chatham, Ontario in 1940. While still in her teens, she started frequenting the folk clubs of Toronto.\n\n===Career===\n====Folk duo====\nThe two started performing together in Toronto in 1959. By 1962, they were living in New York City, where they caught the attention of manager [[Albert Grossman]],<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilliland, John. |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1692106/m1/#track/9 |title=Pop Chronicles Interviews #184 - Ian and Sylvia Tyson - All Tracks UNT Digital Library |publisher=Digital.library.unt.edu |date=1968-01-12 |accessdate=2021-03-02}}</ref> who managed [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] and would soon become [[Bob Dylan]]'s manager. Grossman secured them a contract with [[Vanguard Records]] and they released their first album late in the year.<ref name=\"canadianmusichalloffame.ca\"/>\n\nTheir first album, self-titled ''Ian & Sylvia'', on Vanguard Records consists mainly of traditional songs.<ref>{{cite magazine|date=August 25, 1962|magazine=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=24|title=Ian & Sylvia|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> There were British and Canadian folk songs, spiritual music, and a few [[blues]] songs thrown into the mix. The album was moderately successful and they made the list of performers for the 1963 [[Newport Folk Festival]].\n\n''Four Strong Winds'', their second album, was similar to the first, with the exception of the inclusion of the early Dylan composition \"[[Tomorrow Is a Long Time]]\" and the title song \"[[Four Strong Winds]]\", written by Ian Tyson. \"Four Strong Winds\" was a major hit in Canada and ensured their stardom.<ref>[http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1963/Ch196310.html 30 Years of Canadian Chart Listings] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20021102214504/http://www.webfitz.com/lyrics/Charts/1963/Ch196310.html |date=2002-11-02 }} - #9 on 28 October 1963</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Ian & Sylvia|date=October 19, 1963|journal=Billboard Magazine|page=18|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Years later, the song was named as the greatest Canadian song of all time by the CBC-Radio program ''50 Tracks: The Canadian Version''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe two married in June 1964; they also released their third album, ''Northern Journey'', that year. It included a song written by Sylvia, titled \"[[You Were on My Mind]]\", recorded by both the California group [[We Five]] (a 1965 #4 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, #1 on the Cashbox chart, #3 on the Billboard Hot 100) and British [[folk rock]] singer [[Crispian St. Peters]] (#29 on the [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] charts, #36 in 1967).<ref>Joel Whitburn, ''Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits''</ref> A recording of \"Four Strong Winds\" by [[Bobby Bare]] made it to #3 on the [[country music|country]] charts around that time.\n\nOn the ''Northern Journey'' album was the song \"[[Someday Soon (Ian Tyson song)|Someday Soon]]\", a composition by Ian Tyson that would rival \"Four Strong Winds\" in its popularity. (Both songs would eventually be recorded by dozens of singers.)\n\nTheir fourth album, ''Early Morning Rain'', consisted in large part of new songs. They introduced the work of the couple's fellow Canadian songwriter and performer [[Gordon Lightfoot]] through the title song and \"(That's What You Get) For Lovin' Me\". They also included the first recording of the song \"[[Darcy Farrow]]\" by [[Steve Gillette]] and Tom Campbell, as well as a number of their own compositions.\n \nThey performed at the [[1965 Newport Folk Festival]].<ref name=pc32>{{Pop Chronicles |32| 1}}</ref> ''Play One More'', their offering of 1965, showed a move toward the electrified folk-like music that was becoming popular with groups like [[the Byrds]] and [[the Lovin' Spoonful]]. The title tune used horns to evoke the [[mariachi]] style.\n\nIn 1967, they released two albums, one recorded for Vanguard, the other for [[MGM]]. These two efforts, ''So Much For Dreaming'' and ''Lovin' Sound'', were far less dynamic presentations.\n\nFrom 1970 to 1975, Ian Tyson hosted ''The Ian Tyson Show'' on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], known as ''Nashville North'' in its first season. Sylvia Tyson and the Great Speckled Bird appeared often on the series.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/17889/ian_tyson_show,_the/details/ | title=Ian Tyson Show, The (Series) (1970-1975) |date=February 2003 | access-date=July 18, 2019 | publisher=TV Archive}}</ref>\n\n====Country rock pioneers====\nThey moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where they recorded two albums; one to fulfill the terms of their Vanguard contract, the other to supply MGM with a second (and last) album for that label. The albums can be defined as early [[country rock]] music; ''Nashville'' for Vanguard was cut in February 1968, one month before the Byrds' ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'', widely considered the first collaboration of rock and Nashville players.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone-Nashville\"/> Three of Bob Dylan's ''[[Basement Tapes]]'' songs are included on their Nashville albums; most of the rest were written by Ian or Sylvia.<ref name=\"Rolling Stone-Nashville\">{{cite magazine | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-ian-sylvias-nashville-country-rocks-great-lost-album-20150722 | title=Inside Ian & Sylvia's 'Nashville,' Country-Rock's Great Lost Album | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=July 22, 2015 | access-date=October 11, 2016 | author=Browne, David | author-link=David Browne (journalist)}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, Ian & Sylvia formed the [[country rock]] group [[Great Speckled Bird (band)|Great Speckled Bird]]. In addition to participating in the cross-Canada rock-and-roll rail tour [[Festival Express]], they recorded [[Great Speckled Bird (album)|a self-titled album]] for the short-lived [[Ampex]] label. Produced by [[Todd Rundgren]], the record failed when Ampex was unable to establish widespread distribution. Thousands of copies never left the warehouse, and it has become a much sought-after collector's item. Initially, the album artist was given as Great Speckled Bird but later copies had a sticker saying that it featured the duo.\n\nIan & Sylvia's last two albums were recorded on [[Columbia Records]]. The first, 1971's ''Ian and Sylvia'' (not to be confused with their 1962 self-titled release) consists largely of mainstream country-flavored songs. This album was released on CD, with extra tracks, as ''The Beginning of the End'' in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r245993|pure_url=yes}}|title=''The Beginning of the End''|website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2012-04-04}}</ref> Their second Columbia record, 1972's ''You Were on My Mind'', featured a later incarnation of Great Speckled Bird. The songs range from hard country rock to middle-of-the-road country material. Neither of the Columbia albums sold well. They were eventually combined and released as 1974's ''The Best of Ian and Sylvia''.\n\nIn 1972, Ian & Sylvia performed the song \"Let Her Alone\" for [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]]' live-action drama ''[[Run, Cougar, Run]]''. Ian also served as the film's narrator.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://every70smovie.blogspot.com/2016/08/run-cougar-run-1972.html|title=Every 70s Movie: Run, Cougar, Run (1972)|first=Peter|last=Hanson|website=Every70smovie.blogspot.com|date=August 18, 2016}}</ref>\n\nBy 1975, Ian & Sylvia had stopped performing together and soon afterwards were divorced. Their final appearance as a duo was in May 1975 at the [[Horseshoe Tavern]] in Toronto.<ref name=ce/>\n\n===Post-divorce===\nAfter their marriage ended in 1975, Ian returned to Southern Alberta to farm and train horses, but continued his musical career.

Appearances at the [[Newport Folk Festival]], ''[[The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson]]'', and New York's [[The Town Hall (New York City)|Town Hall]] increased his following and bolstered his reputation. 1966 marked the release of his debut album ''[[Lightfoot!]]'', which brought him greater exposure as both a singer and a songwriter. The album featured many now-famous songs, including \"For Lovin' Me\", \"Early Mornin' Rain\", \"Steel Rail Blues\", and \"Ribbon of Darkness\". On the strength of the ''Lightfoot!'' album, which blended Canadian and universal themes, Lightfoot became one of the first Canadian singers to achieve definitive home-grown stardom without having moved permanently to the United States to develop it. Lightfoot also recorded in the [[Nashville, Tennessee]] area at [[Bradley's Barn|Forest Hills Music Studio (\"Bradley's Barn\")]] run by [[Owen Bradley]] and his son [[Jerry Bradley (music executive)|Jerry]] during the 1960s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/jerry-bradley |access-date=May 2, 2023 |title=Jerry Bradley |website=Country Music Hall of Fame |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220816221321/https://www.countrymusichalloffame.org/hall-of-fame/jerry-bradley |archive-date=August 16, 2022}}</ref>\n\nTo kick off Canada's [[Canadian Centennial|Centennial]] year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] commissioned Lightfoot to write the \"[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]\" for a special broadcast on January 1, 1967.  Between 1966 and 1969, Lightfoot recorded four additional albums for United Artists: ''[[The Way I Feel (Gordon Lightfoot album)|The Way I Feel]]'' (1967), ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'' (1968), ''[[Back Here on Earth]]'' (1968), and the live recording ''[[Sunday Concert]]'' (1969), and consistently placed singles in the Canadian top 40, including \"Go-Go Round\", \"Spin, Spin\", and \"The Way I Feel\". His biggest hit of the era was a rendition of Bob Dylan's \"[[Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the Canadian charts in December 1965. ''[[Did She Mention My Name?]]'', released in January 1968, featured \"Black Day in July\", about the 1967 Detroit riot. Weeks later, upon the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]] on April 4, radio stations in 30 states pulled the song for \"fanning the flames\", even though the song was a plea for racial harmony.  Lightfoot stated at the time radio station owners cared more about playing songs \"that make people happy\" and not those \"that make people think.\"  Unhappy at a lack of support from United Artists, he defected to [[Warner Bros. Records]], scoring his first major international hit in early 1971 with \"If You Could Read My Mind\".\n\nLightfoot's albums from this time were well received abroad but did not produce any hit singles. Outside of Canada, he remained better known as a songwriter than as a performer, yet he was to find commercial success there before he was fully appreciated in his own country.<ref name=\"Edwardson2009\">{{cite book |last1=Edwardson |first1=Ryan |title=Canuck Rock: A History of Canadian Popular Music |date=2009 |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=978-0-8020-9989-1 |page=165 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cwc4o2qntH4C&pg=PA165}}</ref><ref name=\"Marsh1999\">{{cite book |editor1-last=Marsh |editor1-first=James H. |title=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=1999 |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |isbn=978-0-7710-2099-5 |pages=1865\u20131866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wR_-aSFyvuYC&pg=PA1865}}</ref>\n\nHis success as a live performer continued to grow throughout the late 1960s. He embarked on his first Canadian national tour in 1967, and also performed in New York City.

The affliction curtailed his touring schedule but Lightfoot nevertheless continued to deliver major hits: in June 1974 his classic single \"[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]\" from the album ''Sundown'' went to [[Hot 100 No. 1 Hits of 1974|No.1]] on the American and Canadian charts. It would be his only number one hit in the United States. He performed it twice on NBC's ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]'' series. \"Carefree Highway\" (about [[Arizona State Route 74]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]) was the follow-up single from the same album.

The lyrics in his song, \"[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald|The Wreck of the ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']]\", released the following year, were substantially based on facts in the article. It reached number two on the United States ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart and was a number one hit in Canada. Lightfoot appeared at several 25th anniversary memorial services of the sinking, and stayed in personal contact with the family members of the men who perished in the ''Edmund Fitzgerald.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ssedmundfitzgerald.org/gordon-lightfoot-song/|title=\"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" by Gordon Lightfoot|publisher=S S Edmund Fitzgerald Online|access-date=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Lightfoot had another top 40 hit on the United States Hot 100, a re-recorded version of \"The Circle Is Small (I Can See It in Your Eyes),\" which reached number 33.\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\nDuring the 1980s and the 1990s, Lightfoot recorded six more original albums and a compilation for Warner Bros./Reprise: ''[[Dream Street Rose]]'' (1980), ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' (1982), ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' (1983), ''[[East of Midnight]]'' (1986), another compilation ''[[Gord's Gold Volume II]]'' (1988), ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993), and ''[[A Painter Passing Through]]'' (1998).\n\nThe album ''Dream Street Rose'' has the folk-pop sound that Lightfoot established during the previous decade. In addition to the title song, it includes songs such as \"Ghosts of Cape Horn\" and \"On the High Seas\". It also includes the [[Leroy Van Dyke]] 1950s composition \"The Auctioneer\", a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]-like number that was a concert staple for Lightfoot from the mid-1960s to the 1980s. The album ''[[Shadows (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Shadows]]'' represents a departure from the acoustic sound of his guitar playing in the 1970s and introduces an adult-contemporary sound. Songs like \"Shadows\" and \"Thank You for the Promises\" contain an underlying sadness and resignation. The 1982 American released single \"Baby Step Back\" marked his last time in the top 50 in that country.\nThe 1983 album ''[[Salute (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Salute]]'' produced no hit singles; the 1986 ''East of Midnight'' album had several [[Adult Contemporary]] songs like \"A Passing Ship\", \"Morning Glory\", and \"I'll Tag Along\" (East of Midnight). A single from ''East of Midnight'', \"Anything for Love\", made the 1986 Billboard Country and Western chart.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSQEAAAAMBAJ&dq=%22Anything+for+Love%22+billboard+country+and+western+chart&pg=PA35|title=Anything for Love; Billboard|date=October 18, 1986|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1987, Lightfoot filed a lawsuit against composer [[Michael Masser]], claiming that Masser's melody for the song \"The Greatest Love of All\", versions of which were recorded and released by [[George Benson]] in 1977 and [[Whitney Houston]] in 1985, had stolen 24 bars from Lightfoot's 1971 hit song \"If You Could Read My Mind\". The transitional section that begins \"I decided long ago never to walk in anyone's shadow\" of the Masser song has the same melody as \"I never thought I could feel this way and I got to say that I just don't get it; I don't know where we went wrong but the feeling's gone and I just can't get it back\" of Lightfoot's song. Lightfoot later stated that he did not want people thinking that he had stolen his melody from Masser.<ref>{{cite web|author=Florian BODENSEHER |url=http://www.corfid.com/gl/biography.htm |title=Gordon Lightfoot \u2013 Biography |website=Corfid.com |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> The case was settled out of court and Masser issued a public apology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://storyofsongs.blogspot.com/2009/08/greatest-love.html |title=Greatest Love |date=August 29, 2009 |access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref> Lightfoot rounded out the decade with his follow-up compilation ''[[Gord's Gold Volume II]],'' in late 1988, which contained re-recorded versions of his most popular songs, including a re-make of the 1970 song \"The Pony Man\". The original had been brisk in pace, acoustic, and about three minutes long. This new version was slower, clocking in at four minutes plus. Lightfoot performed with Canadian singer-songwriter [[Ian Tyson]] at the opening ceremonies of the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Lightfoot returned to his acoustic roots and recorded two albums. ''[[Waiting for You (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Waiting for You]]'' (1993) includes songs such as \"Restless\", \"Wild Strawberries\", and Bob Dylan's \"Ring Them Bells\".  1998's ''A Painter Passing Through'' reintroduced a sound more reminiscent of his early recordings,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Chrispell|first=James|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-pH4i3jXvAC&q=With+the+release+of+A+Painter+Passing+Through%2C+Lightfoot+appears+to+have+found+home+and+has+turned+in+his+best+work+in+years.+Gone+are+the+uncertain+arrangements+of+the+past%3B+in+their+place%2C+there+is+a+welcome+return+to+the+essence+of+the+%22Sundown%22+musical+era.&pg=PA654|title=All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul|publisher=Backbeat Books|year=2002|isbn=9780879306533|editor-last=Bogdanov|editor-first=Vladimir|location=San Francisco, CA|pages=654|chapter=A Painter Passing Through / May 12, 1998 / Reprise|editor-last2=Woodstra|editor-first2=Chris|editor-last3=Erlewine|editor-first3=Stephen Thomas}}</ref> with songs like \"Much to My Surprise\", \"Red Velvet\", \"Drifters\", and \"I Used to Be a Country Singer\".

PBS stations offered a videotape of the concert as a pledge gift, and a tape and DVD were released in 2001 in Europe and North America. This was the first Lightfoot concert video released. In April 2001, Lightfoot performed at the Tin Pan South Legends concert at [[Ryman Auditorium]] in Nashville, closing the show.  In May, he performed \"Ring Them Bells\" at [[Massey Hall]] in honour of Bob Dylan's 60th birthday.\n\nBy January 2002, Lightfoot had written 30 new songs for his next studio album. He recorded guitar and vocal demos of some of these new songs. In September, before the second concert of a two-night stand in [[Orillia]], Lightfoot suffered severe stomach pain and was airlifted to [[McMaster University Medical Centre]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. He underwent emergency [[vascular surgery]] for a ruptured [[abdominal aortic aneurysm]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationalpost.com/entertainment/gordon-lightfoot-is-happy-to-be-all-live|title=Gordon Lightfoot is happy to be All Live|date=April 27, 2012|newspaper=National Post|access-date=September 20, 2018|last1=Kaplan|first1=Ben}}</ref> and he remained in serious condition in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).

More than three months after being taken to the McMaster Medical Centre, Lightfoot was released in December to continue his recovery at home.\n\nIn 2003, Lightfoot underwent follow-up surgery to continue the treatment of his abdominal condition. In November he signed a new recording contract with [[Linus Entertainment]] and began rehearsing with his band for the first time since his illness.  Also in 2003, [[Borealis Records]], a label related to Linus Entertainment, released ''Beautiful: A Tribute to Gordon Lightfoot''.  On this album, various artists, including The [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], [[Jesse Winchester]], [[Maria Muldaur]], and [[The Tragically Hip]] interpreted Lightfoot's songs. The final track on the album, \"Lightfoot\", was the only song not previously released by Lightfoot. It was composed and performed by [[Aengus Finnan]].\n\nIn January 2004, Lightfoot completed work on his album ''[[Harmony (Gordon Lightfoot album)|Harmony]]'', which he had mostly recorded prior to his illness. The album was released on his new home label of Linus Records on May 11 of that year.  It was his 20th original album and included a single and new video for \"Inspiration Lady\". Other songs on the album are \"Clouds of Loneliness\", \"Sometimes I Wish\", \"Flyin' Blind\", and \"No Mistake About It\". The album also contains the upbeat yet reflective track called \"End of All Time\" In July 2004, he made a surprise comeback performance, his first since falling ill, at Mariposa in Orillia, performing \"I'll Tag Along\" solo. In August he performed a five-song solo set in [[Peterborough, Ontario|Peterborough]], Ontario, at a flood relief benefit. In November he made his long-awaited return to the concert stage with two sold-out benefit shows in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Lightfoot returned to the music business with his new album selling well and an appearance on ''[[Canadian Idol]]'', where the six top contestants each performed a song of his, culminating in a group performance \u2013 on their own instruments \u2013 of his ''[[Canadian Railroad Trilogy]]''.

His first marriage in April 1963 was to Brita Ingegerd Olaisson, a Swede, with whom he had two children, Fred and Ingrid. They divorced in 1973, the marriage ending in part because of his infidelity. Lightfoot acknowledged that his musical touring and the fact that he found fidelity difficult in a long-distance relationship contributed to the failure of at least two relationships.\n\nThe song \"[[If You Could Read My Mind]]\" was written in reflection upon his disintegrating marriage. At the request of his daughter, Ingrid, he performed the lyrics with a slight change: the line \"I'm just trying to understand the feelings that you lack\" is altered to \"I'm just trying to understand the feelings that ''we'' lack.\" He said in an interview that the difficulty with writing songs inspired by personal stories is that there is not always the emotional distance and clarity to make lyrical improvements such as the one his daughter suggested.\n\nLightfoot was single for 16 years and had two other children from relationships between his first and second marriages: Gaylen McGee and Eric Lightfoot.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.corfid.com/vbb/archive/index.php/t-15235.html |title=Gord's eldest children |website=Gordon Lightfoot Forums |access-date=December 3, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1970s, Lightfoot was involved with [[Cathy Smith]]; their volatile relationship inspired his songs \"[[Sundown (Gordon Lightfoot song)|Sundown]]\" and \"[[Rainy Day People]]\" among others. \"Cathy was a great lady,\" Lightfoot told ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' after her death. \"Men were drawn to her, and she used to make me jealous.

Its success was due in part to the efforts of his new manager, future Hollywood producer [[Jerry Weintraub]], who signed Denver in 1970. Weintraub insisted on a reissue of the track and began a radio airplay campaign that started in Denver, Colorado. Denver's career flourished thereafter, and he had a series of hits over the next four years.

In 1976, Denver campaigned for [[Jimmy Carter]], who became a close friend and ally.

Denver also founded the environmental group Plant-It 2020 (originally Plant-It 2000).

The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's flight to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately before the final flight. His newly purchased amateur-built Rutan aircraft had an unusual fuel tank selector valve handle configuration. The handle had originally been intended by the plane's designer to be between the pilot's legs. The builder instead put it behind the pilot's left shoulder. The fuel gauge was also placed behind the pilot's seat and was not visible to the person at the controls.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" /> An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" />\n\nBefore the flight, Denver and the mechanic had attempted to extend the reach of the handle using a pair of [[Locking pliers|Vise-Grip pliers]], but this did not solve the problem, and the pilot still could not reach the handle while strapped into his seat. NTSB officials' post-accident investigation showed that because of the fuel selector valve\u2019s positioning, switching fuel tanks required the pilot to turn his body 90 degrees to reach the valve. This created a natural tendency to extend one's right foot against the right rudder pedal to support oneself while turning in the seat, which caused the aircraft to [[Aircraft principal axes|yaw]] (nose right) and pitch up.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" />\n\nThe mechanic said that he told Denver that the fuel sight gauges were visible only to the rear cockpit occupant. Denver had asked how much fuel was shown. He told Denver that there was \"less than half in the right tank and less than a quarter in the left tank\". He then provided Denver with an inspection mirror so he could look over his shoulder at the fuel gauges. The mirror was later recovered from the wreckage. Denver said that he would use the autopilot in flight to hold the airplane level while he turned the fuel selector valve. He turned down an offer to refuel the aircraft, saying that he would only be flying for about an hour.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" />\n\nThe NTSB interviewed 20 witnesses about Denver's last flight. Six of them had seen the plane crash into the bay near Point Pinos.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" /> Four said the aircraft was originally heading west. Five said that they saw the plane in a steep bank, with four saying that the bank was to the right (north). Twelve described seeing the aircraft in a steep nose-down descent. Witnesses estimated the plane's altitude between {{convert|350 and 500|ft}} when heading toward the shoreline. Eight said they heard a \"pop\" or \"backfire\" accompanied by a reduction in the engine noise level just before the plane crashed into the sea.\n\nIn addition to Denver's failing to refuel and his subsequent loss of control while attempting to switch fuel tanks, the NTSB determined other key factors that led to the accident. Foremost among these was his inadequate transition training on this type of aircraft and the builder's decision to put the fuel selector handle in a hard-to-reach place.<ref name=\"AVW\" /><ref name=\"NTSB\" /> The board issued recommendations on the requirement and enforcement of mandatory training standards for pilots operating home-built aircraft. It also emphasized the importance of mandatory ease of access to all controls, including fuel selectors and fuel gauges, in all aircraft.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:JohnDenverMemorialPacificGrove.JPG|thumb|The plaque marking the location of Denver's plane crash in [[Pacific Grove, California]]]]\nUpon the announcement of Denver's death, Colorado Governor [[Roy Romer]] ordered all state flags to be lowered to [[half-mast|half-staff]] in his honor.

The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in [[Greenwich Village]].\n\nInitially, Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanac Singers termed \"peace\" songs while the Nazi\u2013Soviet Pact was in effect. After Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, the group wrote anti-fascist songs. The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians, though the core members included Guthrie, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Millard Lampell]] and [[Lee Hays]]. In keeping with common utopian ideals, meals, chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared. The Sunday hootenannies were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent. Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits among all the members, although in the case of \"[[Union Maid]]\", members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song, ensuring that his children would receive residuals.<ref>{{cite book|page=220|first=Ed|last=Cray|date=2004|title= Ramblin Man: The Life and Times of Woody Guthrie|url=https://archive.org/details/ramblinman00edcr|url-access=registration|publisher= W.

Guthrie wrote numerous Jewish lyrics which can be linked to his close collaborative relationship with Aliza Greenblatt who lived near Guthrie and his family in Brooklyn in the 1940s. Guthrie, the Oklahoma troubadour, and Greenblatt, the Jewish wordsmith, often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other's works, finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice. Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn, where Jewish culture was interwoven with music, modern dance, poetry and anti-fascist, pro-labor, socialist activism. Guthrie was inspired to write songs that arose from this unlikely relationship; he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples.\n\nThese lyrics were rediscovered by [[Nora Guthrie]] and were set to music by the Jewish Klezmer group [[The Klezmatics]] with the release of ''Happy Joyous Hanukkah'' on JMG Records in 2007.

The purpose of this particular character was a reference to Dylan's youthful obsession with Guthrie. The fictional Woody also reflects the fictitious autobiographies that Dylan constructed during his early career as he established his own artistic identity. In the film there is even a scene where the fictional Woody visits the real Woody Guthrie as he lies ill and dying in a hospital in New York (a reference to the times when a nineteen-year-old Dylan would regularly visit his idol, after learning of his whereabouts, while he was hospitalized in New York in the 1960s). Later, a sketch on ''Saturday Night Live'' would spoof these visits, alleging that Dylan stole the line, \"They'll stone you for playing your guitar!\" from Guthrie.\n\n[[File:Okemah mural.jpg|alt=|thumb|Guthrie has continued to remain popular decades after his death; this mural was painted in his hometown of Okemah in 1994]]\n\nPete Seeger had the [[Sloop Woody Guthrie|Sloop ''Woody Guthrie'']] built for an organization he founded, the [[Hudson River Sloop Clearwater]].<ref>[http://www.beaconsloopclub.org/Sloop.html Beacon Sloop Club] Retrieved August 28, 2008.</ref> It was launched in 1978.

When Chris was 16, his father committed suicide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/700club/guests/interviews/CW98_chris_hillman.aspx |title=Chris Hillman: 'Turn, Turn, Turn' |website=Cbn.com |access-date=2015-12-10}}</ref>\n\nHillman became known in San Diego's folk music community as a solid player; this won him an invitation to join his first band, the [[Scottsville Squirrel Barkers]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> The band lasted barely two years, recording only one album (''Blue Grass Favorites'', which was distributed in supermarkets); however, it has a posthumous reputation as the spawning ground for a number of musicians who went on to play in [[the Eagles]], the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Byrds, [[Hearts & Flowers]], and the [[Country Gazette (band)|Country Gazette]]. When the band broke up in late 1963 Hillman received an invitation to join the Golden State Boys, regarded as the top bluegrass band in [[southern California]] and featuring future country star [[Vern Gosdin]], his brother Rex and banjoist [[Don Parmley]] (later of the [[Bluegrass Cardinals]]). Shortly thereafter the band changed its name to [[The Hillmen]];<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> soon Hillman was appearing regularly on television and using a fictitious ID, \"Chris Hardin\", to allow the underage musician into the country bars where many of his gigs were played. When the Hillmen folded, he briefly joined a spinoff of Randy Sparks' [[The New Christy Minstrels|New Christy Minstrels]] known as the Green Grass Revival.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== The Byrds (1964\u20131968) ===\n{{main|The Byrds}}\n[[File:The Byrds 1965.png|thumb|Hillman (far left) as a member of the Byrds in 1965]]\nAt this point a frustrated Hillman considered quitting music and enrolling at [[UCLA]] when he received an offer from The Hillmen's former manager and producer, Jim Dickson, to join Jim (later Roger) McGuinn, David Crosby, Gene Clark and Michael Clarke in a new band, The Byrds.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Hillman was recruited to play bass guitar, although he had never picked up the instrument. Thanks to his bluegrass background, he quickly developed his own melodic style on the instrument. The Byrds' first single, a jangly cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\", was an international hit and marked the birth of [[folk rock]]. During the mid-1960s the Byrds ranked as one of the most successful and influential American pop groups; they recorded a string of hits, including \"[[Turn! Turn! Turn!]]\", \"[[Eight Miles High]]\" and \"[[So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star]]\".\n\nHillman kept a low profile on the band's first two albums, on which McGuinn and Clark shared lead vocals with Crosby adding high harmony and singing the bridge on \"[[All I Really Want to Do]]\". However, Clark's departure in 1966 and Crosby's growing restlessness allowed Hillman the opportunity to develop as a singer and songwriter in the group. He came into his own on the Byrds' 1967 album ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'', co-writing and sharing lead vocals with McGuinn on the hit \"[[So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star]]\".<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Hillman also wrote (and sang) the minor hit \"[[Have You Seen Her Face]]\", \"Thoughts and Words\", \"Time Between\" and \"The Girl with No Name\", the latter two demonstrating his bluegrass and country roots. Hillman's prominence continued with the Byrds' next album, ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'', on which he shared songwriting credit on seven of the album's eleven songs.\n\n=== Pioneering country rock ===\nInternal strife dogged the Byrds, and by the beginning of 1968 the band was down to two original members (Hillman and McGuinn), with Hillman's cousin [[Kevin Kelley (musician)|Kevin Kelley]] on drums. They then hired [[Gram Parsons]] to replace Crosby. Hillman, who had brought country music into the Byrds' earliest recording of \"Satisfied Mind\", found another lover of country music in Parsons.  ''[[Sweetheart of the Rodeo]]'' was recorded in Nashville and Los Angeles and continues to inspire musicians in the Americana format.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Parsons left the band shortly thereafter; Hillman brought in former Kentucky Colonels guitarist [[Clarence White]] as a replacement and White suggested that the group replace Kelley with [[Gene Parsons]] (no relation to Gram) on drums, but this line-up was short-lived and Hillman himself left the Byrds due to financial misappropriation by their management.\n\n=== The Flying Burrito Brothers (1969\u20131972) ===\n{{Main article|The Flying Burrito Brothers}}\n[[File:FlyingBurritos1970.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] (Amsterdam, 1970). From left to right: [[Pete Kleinow|'Sneaky' Pete Kleinow]], [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], Chris Hillman, [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]] & [[Bernie Leadon]] ]]\n\nHillman teamed with Gram Parsons again (this time as vocalist, guitarist and songwriter) to form the [[Flying Burrito Brothers]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Further honing their pioneering country-rock hybrid sound by combining the energy, instrumentation and attitude of [[rock and roll]] with the issues and themes of [[country music]], the Burritos recorded the landmark ''[[The Gilded Palace of Sin]]'' (1969) followed by 1970's ''[[Burrito Deluxe]]''. Parsons was fired from the line-up by June 1970 (replaced by guitarist [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]]) when the band toured Canada as part of the [[Festival Express]] tour, with Hillman reverting to bass guitar. Hillman stayed with the band for two more records, ''[[The Flying Burrito Bros (album)|The Flying Burrito Brothers]]'' and ''[[Last of the Red Hot Burritos]]''.\n\n=== Various bands and solo career (1970s) ===\n{{Main article|Manassas (band)|Souther-Hillman-Furay Band|McGuinn, Clark & Hillman}}\nBefore the Flying Burrito Brothers disbanded, Hillman joined [[Stephen Stills]]' band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> They released two albums, a 1972 [[Manassas (album)|self-titled double album]], and a 1973 album ''[[Down the Road (Manassas album)|Down the Road]]''. Led by Stills, Manassas was an exploration into a mixture of rock, country, blues, bluegrass and Latin music. In 1972, Stills gave Hillman a 1924 [[Lloyd Loar]] [[Gibson F-5]] mandolin.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lewis |first=Randy |date=2017-09-18 |title=Byrds co-founder Chris Hillman taps David Crosby, Roger McGuinn, Tom Petty for new solo album |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-chris-hillman-bidin-my-time-tom-petty-20170810-story.html |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-09-18 |title=Chris Hillman |url=https://www.latimes.com/94338813-132.html |access-date=2024-05-29 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> Hillman remained with Manassas until 1973, when he briefly re-joined the original line-up of the Byrds for a reunion album on [[Asylum Records]].\n\nIn 1974, Hillman teamed with singer-songwriter [[Richie Furay]] (who co-founded [[Buffalo Springfield]] and [[Poco (band)|Poco]]) and songwriter [[JD Souther]] (who co-wrote much of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' early repertoire) in the [[Souther-Hillman-Furay Band]].<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\" /> The trio never quite gelled, and broke up in 1975 after two albums and internal squabbles.\n\nHillman released two solo albums, ''Slippin' Away'' and ''Clear Sailin''',<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> which included several songs co-written with ''[[Crawdaddy!|Crawdaddy]]'' magazine editor [[Peter Knobler]]. One of their songs, \"Step on Out,\" was recorded by [[The Oak Ridge Boys]] on their 1985 album and became the title cut. He was also an in-demand studio musician, playing and singing on sessions for [[Gene Clark]], [[Dillard & Clark]], [[Poco (band)|Poco]], [[Dan Fogelberg]] and others. After an early 1977 UK tour reunited him with [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[Gene Clark]], the trio stayed together as [[McGuinn, Clark & Hillman]] for two albums<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> (on which Hillman continued his songwriting collaboration with Knobler) and one under the McGuinn-Hillman name, with a hit single in 1979's \"Don't You Write Her Off\".\n\n=== The Desert Rose Band (1985\u20131994, 2008) ===\n{{Main article|The Desert Rose Band}}\nBy the early 1980s Hillman had returned to his bluegrass and country roots, recording two acclaimed (mainly acoustic) albums for [[Sugar Hill Records (bluegrass)|Sugar Hill Records]] with singer/guitarist/banjo player [[Herb Pedersen]] (a former member of [[The Dillards]]). Soon after, Hillman and Pedersen formed the [[Desert Rose Band]];<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> this proved to be Hillman's most commercially successful post-Byrds project. Their self-titled debut album in 1987 generated two [[Record chart|Top Ten]] country hits in \"Love Reunited\" (written with Steve Hill), \"One Step Forward\" and the number-one single \"He's Back and I'm Blue.\" From 1987 until late 1993 the band recorded five albums and one Greatest Hits package and had a string of 16 country-music [[Billboard magazine|hits]] (the majority of which were in the country Top Ten) and a number of [[Academy of Country Music]] awards before disbanding in 1994. As Hillman said, \"We definitely quit while we were ahead.\"\n\nChris Hillman, Herb Pedersen, JayDee Maness, John Jorgenson, Bill Bryson, and Steve Duncan performed their first reunion concert on August 27, 2008  in Solana Beach, CA. Before this date Chris Hillman and Herb Pedersen were as a duo joined by John Jorgenson on May 2, 2008 for a small DRB set at the [[Station Inn]] in Nashville. This six-man lineup is the best known, and includes all of the original members present on the hit albums from the 1980s. At this show, Hillman said it was the first time they had played together in 19 years. They went through a string of DRB hits but were unable to play \"He's Back and I'm Blue\" because Hillman said he had forgotten the words. This sold-out show prompted Hillman and the band to play a handful of other reunion shows at  music festivals throughout the U.S. Several of these were recorded for inclusion on a live album, which Hillman hopes to release in the U.S. and Europe. If released, this will be the Desert Rose Band's only live album.\n\n=== 1990s and beyond ===\n[[File:ChrisHillman.jpg|thumb|Hillman in 2004]]\nAt the peak of the Desert Rose Band's success, Hillman began appearing infrequently with McGuinn. A duet recorded by the pair for the [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]]'s ''[[Will The Circle Be Unbroken Vol. II]]'' album, \"You Ain't Going Nowhere\", reached the Country Top 10 in 1989. Soon the pair joined Crosby in a reformed Byrds, playing a handful of club dates. In 1990 they appeared at a tribute to [[Roy Orbison]], performing \"Mr. Tambourine Man\" with the song's composer [[Bob Dylan]]. That same year the Byrds cut four new songs for inclusion in a career-spanning box set, and in 1991 they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. In 1996 Hillman reunited with Desert Rose Band alumnus Herb Pederson for the CD ''Bakersfield Bound''. ''Like a Hurricane'' (1998) and three bluegrass-flavored releases on [[Rounder Records]] with Pedersen, [[Larry Rice (musician)|Larry Rice]], and [[Tony Rice]] followed. He appeared on the 1999 album ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'' in a duet with [[Steve Earle]] on \"High Fashion Queen\" (which Hillman wrote with Parsons).\n\nAfter a brief hiatus Hillman and Pedersen returned with ''Way Out West'' (2002), a 17-track collection of country, [[roots rock]] and [[Americana (music)|Americana]]; this was followed by ''The Other Side'' (2005). In 2010 he recorded \"Live at Edwards Barn\" with Herb Pedersen for Rounder Records.\n\nHillman has continued to write, perform and tour, with dates in 2017 with Herb Pedersen and John Jorgenson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chrishillman.com/calendar.html |title=Tour Dates |publisher=Chris Hillman |access-date=2017-10-07}}</ref>  He released his latest album, ''Bidin' My Time'' (2017), co-produced with [[Tom Petty]], featuring guests including Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and members of The Heartbreakers.

Her first public appearances as a folk artist after her graduation from Denver's East High School were at Michael's Pub in [[Boulder, Colorado]] and the folk club Exodus in Denver.

Collins' ninth studio album ''[[True Stories and Other Dreams]]'' (1973) found her in a contemplative mood, featuring an original song about a friend who took his own life (\"Song for Martin\") and another about the life of Argentine [[Marxism|Marxist]] revolutionary [[Che Guevara]] (\"Che\"). For her tenth studio album ''[[Judith (album)|Judith]]'' (1975), she collaborated with producer [[Arif Mardin]], who gave the album a sophisticated sound. ''Judith'' produced her biggest hit single with her mournful version of Stephen Sondheim's \"[[Send in the Clowns]]\", and it would become her best-selling record, eventually going platinum.\n\nAs Collins stepped up to a higher level of stardom, the longtime activist put political themes at the forefront of her eleventh studio album  ''[[Bread and Roses (album)|Bread and Roses]]'' (1976). Political statements like the title song, originally a poem by [[James Oppenheim]] commonly associated with a 1912 [[1912 Lawrence textile strike|garment workers strike]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]], were balanced with such pop compositions as [[Elton John]]'s \"Come Down in Time\", but the album failed to achieve the commercial success of ''Judith''. Following the release of the album, Collins underwent treatment for damaged vocal cords, and after years of struggling with alcoholism, she sought medical help to give up drinking. Her compilation album ''[[So Early in the Spring (Judy Collins album)|So Early in the Spring... The First 15 Years]]'' (1977) sold modestly.\n\n[[File:Zangeres Judy Collins in Hiltonhotel Amsterdam, Judy Collins, Bestanddeelnr 925-1517.jpg|thumb|right| Collins in Hilton Amsterdam, a hotel, in 1971]]\nCollins guest starred on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' in an episode broadcast in January 1978,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Garlen|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Graham|first2=Anissa M.|title=Kermit Culture: Critical Perspectives on Jim Henson's Muppets|year=2009|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=978-0786442591|page=[https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218 218]|url=https://archive.org/details/kermitculturecri0000unse/page/218}}</ref> singing \"[[Leather-Winged Bat]]\", \"[[There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly]]\", \"[[Do-Re-Mi]]\", and \"Send in the Clowns\".

His string of crossover singles ranked highly on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Pop Singles]], [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]], and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Rhythm and Blues Sides]] charts; in the 1960s, Rodgers had more modest successes with [[adult contemporary music]].\n\nHe was not related to country music pioneer [[Jimmie Rodgers|Jimmie C. Rodgers]] (1897\u20131933), who died the same year the younger Rodgers was born. Among country audiences, and in his official songwriting credits, the younger Rodgers, Jimmie Frederick, was often credited as '''Jimmie F.

Although he loved music, he was uncertain whether he could turn it into a career.

''Inside Belleville'', May 03, 2012</ref> is a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] [[musical group|band]] based in [[Buena Vista, Virginia]] and was formed in September 1994. Its \"parent band\"{{clarify|date=June 2022}} East Coast Bluegrass Band was formed Summer 1985 to compete in the East Coast Bluegrass Championship in [[Crimora, Virginia]].<ref>*[http://bluegrasscountry.org/programs/aotm/nothin-fancy/ Bluegrass Country] profile \"October 2004: Nothin' Fancy\".</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== East Coast Bluegrass Band ===\nThe East Coast Bluegrass Band was the predecessor to Nothin' Fancy formed in 1985. It was formed to compete in the East Coast Bluegrass Championship in [[Crimora, Virginia]].<ref name=belleville /> In 1986 the group won the Virginia Folk Music Society State Bluegrass Band Championship.<ref name=\"samhillbands.com\">[http://www.samhillbands.com/bands/eastcoast/index.shtml \"Biography: East Coast Bluegrass Band\"] Sam Hill Entertainment.</ref> After winning the contest, the band continued to play together at local functions.   The members of the band developed some original material, but remained true to the traditional style of the great [[bluegrass band]]s of the 1940s and 1950s.<ref name=\"samhillbands.com\"/> Nothin' Fancy was formed in 1994. Mike Andes and Mitchell Davis joined forces with Gary Farris on guitar, Tony Shorter on bass, and Guy Carawan on fiddle to play the same East Coast Bluegrass Championship in September 1994 that East Coast Bluegrass Band had once played almost a decade earlier. Nothin' Fancy released their first project \"Bluegrass in a Plain Brown Wrapper\" shortly afterwards.\n\nNothin' Fancy and East Coast Bluegrass Band continued to coexist until 2000 when East Coast Bluegrass Band's members drifted apart and had to reorganize.\n\n=== Notable Changes ===\nChris Sexton, who had appeared with Nothin' Fancy for their first-place victory in the band competition at the Maury River Fiddler's Convention in 1998 and recorded as a guest fiddler on the band's second and third releases (\"Earn Your Ticket\" and \"Field of Dreams,\" respectively), officially became the newest member of Nothin' Fancy in 2000.  The fourth project, ''Now and Then'' is the first album to feature the five-piece group as it is today.\n\nShorter departed from the group in 2005, and was replaced by Eli Johnston of [[Branson, MO]].  Nothin' Fancy released \"Album No.&nbsp;7\" under Pinecastle with Johnston and featured him as the lead vocal on the song \"Tupelo County Jail,\" but Johnston only stayed with the group for 13 months.  Citing artistic differences, he left the group and joined the band Pine Mountain Railroad.  Nothin' Fancy's members called Shorter back into service in time for the 6th Annual Nothin' Fancy Bluegrass Festival.  Shorter, who at the time was playing bass for country star [[Keith Bryant]], happily agreed and the band was re-united with its original cast and has stayed as such since.\n\nGary Farris, the guitar player, also departed the group in July 2012 and was replaced by Justin Tomlin.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/justin-tomlin-to-nothin-fancy/ \"Justin Tomlin to Nothin\u2019 Fancy\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref> Tomlin left in March 2014, and Jesse Smathers joined the group in his place.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/jesse-smathers-to-nothin-fancy \"Jesse Smathers to Nothin Fancy\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref> In June 2015, Jesse Smathers departed the group and was replaced by guitar and dobro player, Caleb Cox.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/jesse-smathers-to-lonesome-river-band \"Jesse Smathers to Lonesome River Band\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref> A month later, the band signed a recording contract with Mountain Fever Records and released their first project for the label \"By Any Other Name\" in August 2015.<ref>[http://bluegrasstoday.com/nothin-fancy-to-mountain-fever \"Nothin\u2019 Fancy to Mountain Fever\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>\n\nIn 2019, founding member Mitchell Davis announced that he would be leaving the band. Following his departure, the band announced in March of that year that it had signed on Jacob Flick to take up Davis' role on the banjo.<ref>[https://bluegrasstoday.com/jacob-flick-to-nothin-fancy \"Jacob Flick to Nothin\u2019 Fancy\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>\n\nIn June 2021, it was announced that Jacobe \"Jake\" Lauzon would be joining the band to play guitar and provide vocals. Jake, originally from Ontario, Canada, was a welcome addition to the group, having been was recognized as the Bluegrass Guitar Player of the Year in 2018 and 2019 at the Central Canadian Bluegrass Awards.<ref>[https://bluegrasstoday.com/jake-lauzon-to-nothin-fancy-on-guitar/ \"Jake Lauzon to Nothin\u2019 Fancy\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>\n\nIn September 2022, it was announced that Jake Lauzon would be departing from the band to pursue new musical interests after playing one final set at the 20th Nothin' Fancy Festival.\n\nIn December 2022, the band announced that it had found its new guitar player, Curt Gausman. Curt, who got his bluegrass start in the 1980s, was part of Hobbs and Partners, which was led by Arnold Hobbs. The group also included John Paganoni, John\u2019s son Chris (who filled in as a substitute with Nothin\u2019 Fancy on more than one occasion), and Mark Delaney. From his work with Hobbs, he later formed the Hazel River Band, which he led through 1996 and recorded two albums with the Hay Holler label. <ref>[https://bluegrasstoday.com/curt-gausman-to-nothin-fancy/ \"Curt Gausman to Nothin\u2019 Fancy\"]. ''Bluegrass Today''.</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\n\nEast Coast Bluegrass Band released four self-produced albums.  They then contracted [[Tim Austin]] of [[Doobie Shea Records|Doobie Shea Studios]] to produce and record the project. Recording began in February 1996. Later that spring, lightning struck and destroyed the studio and all the recorded sessions. Once it was up and running again they were one of the first acts to record in the new studio.<ref name=\"samhillbands.com\"/> After four albums, thirteen years, and hundreds of performances, the band released their first nationally distributed recording project, ''Life's Mysteries'' on [[Copper Creek Records]].\n\nThe group, now appearing as Nothin' Fancy, was approached by [[Pinecastle Records]] and signed to the label in 2002.  They recorded their fifth project, \"Once Upon a Road\" with the title song written for the band by [[Tom T. Hall]] and his wife Dixie.  \"Once Upon a Road\" rose to number 10 on the Bluegrass Charts as posted by [[Bluegrass Unlimited]].  Their bluegrass gospel song \"When the Angels Take My Hand\" rose to the Number 1 spot on the Bluegrass Gospel charts as posted by (the now-defunct) ''Bluegrass Now'' magazine.  The album also earned them a showcase at the [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] (IBMA) Convention in October 2002 and a nomination for the [[International Bluegrass Music Awards|IBMA]] Emerging Artist of the Year Award.\n\nTheir sixth album, \"Reflections,\" was a much more personal album, with Andes penning 10 of the 13 songs.  It featured the novelty single \"I Met My Baby in the Porta-John Line\" as a bonus track, also by Andes.  \"Reflections\" was not as commercially successful as \"Once Upon a Road,\" but it was from these two albums and the performances from this period that Nothin' Fancy had found its highly unique voice, which paid homage to bands such as the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] and the [[Seldom Scene]].  The late [[Charlie Waller (American musician)|Charlie Waller]], a founding member of the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] who went on to lead that group until his death in 2004, met with Andes at the [http://www.spbgma.com/ Society for the Preservation of Bluegrass Music of America] annual convention and learned the song \"Heaven Got an Angel\" from Andes (that was recorded originally on \"Field of Dreams\") and recorded it on the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]] album \"Cryin' in the Chapel.\"\n\nTheir eighth album, ''Lord Bless This House'', the first all-gospel recording for the group, was officially released January 27, 2009 through [http://www.pinecastle.com/ Pinecastle].  Co-produced by Grammy-nominated bluegrass artist [[Rhonda Vincent]] and her brother Darrin Vincent (of Dailey and Vincent fame) with guest appearances from the both of them, it is frequently played on [[Sirius XM]] Radio's [[Bluegrass Junction]] station, along with other selections from their discography.\n\n''Undeniable'' is the group's 16th studio recording, released in 2019 to celebrate their 25th year together. The album includes all-original songwriting by Mike Andes, Caleb Cox, and Chris Sexton. It features Mike Andes (mandolin, lead/harmony vocals), Chris Sexton (fiddle, harmony vocals), Caleb Cox (guitar, lead/harmony vocals), James Cox (bass), and Jacob Flick (banjo). Cello, viola, and string arrangements on \u201cHere\u2019s To My Life\u201d were provided by Chris Sexton. The album was recorded, mixed, and mastered at Mountain Fever Studios in [[Willis, Floyd County, Virginia|Willis, Virginia]] and released by [[Mountain Fever Records]].\n\n== Performance ==\n\nEast Coast Bluegrass Band paid their dues at lawn parties and bars in and around the [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]] area and the [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] area for many years.  In years since, the band, as Nothin' Fancy, has played the [[Grand Ole Opry]] at the historic [[Ryman Auditorium]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]],<ref>[http://www.bluegrassworks.com/profile.php?profileID=31 Bluegrass Works] interview \"Nothin' Fancy\" with Loretta Sawyer, 03/25/2004.</ref> and with the \"Bluegrass Series with [[Rhonda Vincent]] & Nothin' Fancy\".<ref>[http://nemr.net/~rhondav/ Official Website] Rhonda Vincent.</ref> They have played such other major venues as [[Lincoln Center]] in [[New York City]], and [[The Birchmere]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].  Nothin' Fancy plays about 140 shows a year and is a staple on the bluegrass festival circuit.<ref>[http://journalstar.com/articles/2007/09/28/living/gz/performances/doc46fb0ee5f118e173797113.txt Lincoln Journal Star] \"Members of Nothin' Fancy tell bluegrass listeners to expect something different\" by L. Kent Wolgamott, September 28, 2007.</ref> The band has been known to take fans on bus trips to festivals and accompanying them on bluegrass cruises aboard the [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]] and [[Carnival]] cruises.<ref>[http://bluegrasscountry.org/programs/aotm/nothin-fancy/ Bluegrass Country] profile \"October 2004: Nothin' Fancy\".</ref> Nothin' Fancy performed in June 2010 at the Tottenhan Bluegrass Festival in [[Ontario, Canada]], and the band toured as part of the 2012 Bluegrass Sundays Winter Concert series organized by the Northern Bluegrass Committee in Scarborough, Ontario.<ref>\"Bluegrass Sundays\" concert program, Northern Bluegrass Committee, 2012</ref>\n\n== Musical style and sound ==\nThe band seeks to remain \"true to the traditional sounds of the great bluegrass bands of the 1940s and '50s\",<ref name=\"samhillbands.com\"/> while also performing and recording original songs by their prolific songwriter, lead singer Mike Andes.  Classic bluegrass material draws from [[Bill Monroe]], [[Ralph Stanley]], the [[The Country Gentlemen|Country Gentlemen]], and the [[Seldom Scene]]; but song selection ranges from original material to gospel classics to covers of pop artists such as [[Bob Seger]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Bill Withers]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]].\n\nIn live performance Nothin' Fancy has been noted for its strong vocals, four-part arrangements, and its high-energy shows well-seasoned with humor.  The quintet's early years saw the band gathering around one microphone, employing a shell-game choreography for solos and back-up which keeps the show visually active as well as aurally pleasing, although the most recent configuration is more traditional with individual microphones for instruments and vocals. Andes' clear singing style is attributed to the unique stylings of [[Charlie Waller (American musician)|Charlie Waller]], whose earthy bass-baritone voice sang with clear enunciation.  Farris sings a bold tenor harmony remarkable for its projection; his powerful delivery has been likened to the late [[John Duffey]] of the [[Seldom Scene]].  Shorter occasionally sings baritone harmonies an octave higher, while Davis sings bass vocals, more on gospel songs. In later recordings, Davis gave up singing bass and allowed Sexton to sing bass on gospel songs\n\n==Nothin' Fancy Bluegrass Festival==\nIn 2001, a Rockbridge County entrepreneur, Morris O'Shields, created a bluegrass festival at the Glen Maury Park, the site of the Maury River Fiddler's Convention where Nothin' Fancy won its victory three years before.  The festival was named for Nothin' Fancy, who have served as the host act in years since.<ref>[http://www.rockbridgeweekly.com/rw_article.php?ndx=9737 Rockbridge Weekly] \"Virginia Based Bluegrass Band Nothin' Fancy Garners National Music Award\".</ref>  Just as the band originally named itself after the first music festival in which it competed\u2014subsequently winning the prize\u2014it then had a music festival, whose competition it had also won, subsequently named for it.\n\nThe so-named festival has become a much-loved annual event that brings scores of bluegrass fans to the [[Shenandoah Valley]] and to the little town of [[Buena Vista, VA]], where Farris calls home (and from which the band operates).
