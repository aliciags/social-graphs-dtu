Siblings included brothers Jay and Clayton.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 8\u20139.]]</ref> The boys grew up hearing [[Southern gospel]] music sung by white friends in church and by black field workers and sharecroppers in the cotton fields.<ref name=pc8>{{Pop Chronicles|8|3}}</ref> On Saturday nights Perkins would listen to the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', broadcast from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] on his father's radio.\n\n[[Roy Acuff]]'s broadcasts from the Opry inspired Perkins to ask his parents for a guitar.<ref>[[#legends|Naylor.]]</ref> Since they could not afford to buy one, his father made one from a [[cigar box guitar|cigar box]] and a broomstick. Eventually, a neighbor sold his father a worn-out [[Gene Autry]] guitar. Perkins could not afford new strings, and when they broke, he had to retie them. The knots cut his fingers when he would slide to another note, so he began bending the notes, stumbling onto a type of [[blue note]].<ref name=\"naylor118\" /><ref name=\":0\">[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 13\u201314.]]</ref>\n\nPerkins taught himself parts of Acuff's \"[[The Great Speckled Bird (song)|Great Speckled Bird]]\" and \"[[The Wabash Cannonball]]\", having heard them played on the ''Opry''. He also has cited [[Bill Monroe]]'s fast playing and vocals as an early influence.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 11\u201312.]]</ref> Perkins also learned from John Westbrook, an African-American field worker in his sixties who played blues and gospel music on an old acoustic guitar. Westbrook advised Perkins to \"Get down close to it. You can feel it travel down the strangs, come through your head and down to your soul where you live. You can feel it. Let it vib-a-rate.\"<ref name=\"naylor118\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn January 1947, the Perkins family moved from [[Lake County, Tennessee]], to [[Madison County, Tennessee|Madison County]], 70 miles from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], the largest city in West Tennessee and a center of a great variety of music played by both black and white artists.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 55.]]</ref> At age fourteen Perkins wrote a country song called \"Let Me Take You to the Movie, Magg\". [[Sam Phillips]] was later persuaded by the quality of that song to sign Perkins to his [[Sun Records]] label.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 30, 68.]]</ref>\n\n===Beginnings as a performer===\nPerkins and his brother Jay had their first paying job (in tips) as entertainers during late 1946 at the Cotton Boll tavern on Highway 45, twelve miles south of Jackson, Tennessee, starting on Wednesday nights. Perkins was 14 years old. One of the songs they played was an up-tempo country blues shuffle version of [[Bill Monroe]]'s \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\". Free drinks were one of the perks of playing in a tavern, and Perkins drank four beers that first night. Within a month Carl and Jay began playing Friday and Saturday nights at the Sand Ditch tavern, near the western boundary of Jackson. Both places were the scene of occasional fights, and both of the Perkins brothers gained a reputation as fighters.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 36\u201341.]]</ref>\n\nDuring the next couple of years, as they became better known, the Perkins brothers began playing other taverns around Bemis and Jackson, including El Rancho, the Roadside Inn, and the Hilltop. Carl persuaded his brother Clayton to join them and play the [[upright bass]], to complete the sound of the band.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 48.]]</ref>\n\nPerkins began performing regularly on [[WTJF (AM)|WTJS]] in Jackson during the late 1940s as a sometime member of the [[Tennessee Ramblers (Tennessee band)|Tennessee Ramblers]]. He appeared on the radio program ''Hayloft Frolic'', on which he performed two songs. Sometimes one was \"Talking Blues\", as done by Robert Lunn on the ''Grand Ole Opry''. Perkins and his brothers began appearing on ''The Early Morning Farm and Home Hour''. Positive listener response resulted in a 15-minute segment sponsored by Mother's Best Flour. By the end of the 1940s, the Perkins Brothers were the best-known band in the Jackson area.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 48\u201349.]]</ref> Perkins had day jobs during most of these early years, including picking cotton, working at various factories and plants, and as a pan greaser for the Colonial Baking Company.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 32, 70\u201371.]]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockabillytennessee.com/legend_carl_perkins.htm |title=The Legend Carl Perkins |publisher=Rockabillytennessee.com |date=1998-01-19 |access-date=2011-11-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117221958/http://www.rockabillytennessee.com/legend_carl_perkins.htm |archive-date=November 17, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> His brothers had similar pick-up jobs.\n\nIn January 1953, Perkins married Valda Crider, whom he had known for a number of years. When his job at the bakery was reduced to part-time, Valda, who had her own job, encouraged Perkins to begin working the taverns full-time. He began playing six nights a week. Later the same year he added [[W. S. Holland|W.S. \"Fluke\" Holland]] to the band as a drummer. Holland had no previous experience as a musician but had a good sense of rhythm.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 70\u201371.]]</ref>\n\n[[Malcolm Yelvington]], who remembered the Perkins Brothers when they played in [[Covington, Tennessee]], in 1953, noted that Carl had an unusual blues-like style all his own.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, p. 77.]]</ref> By 1955 Perkins had made tapes of his material with a borrowed tape recorder, and he sent them to companies such as Columbia and RCA. But he used addresses such as \"Columbia Records, New York City\" and seemed dismayed at the lack of response. \"I had sent tapes to RCA and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and had never heard a thing from 'em.\"<ref name=\"Top Beats Bottom\"/>\n\nIn July 1954, Perkins and his wife heard a new release of \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\" by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Scotty Moore]] and [[Bill Black]] on the radio.<ref>[http://rcs-discography.com/rcs/pics/d03/3318.htm]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref> As the song faded out, Perkins said, \"There's a man in Memphis who understands what we're doing.

Berry assured him that they had remained much more popular in Britain since the 1950s than they had in the United States, and that there would be large crowds of fans at every show. The popular young rock group [[The Animals]] backed the two performers. On the last night of the tour, Perkins attended a party where he sat on the floor sharing stories, playing guitar, and singing songs while surrounded by the [[The Beatles|Beatles]].

That same year [[Bob Luman]] had a Top 40 Country hit with Carl's song \"Poor Boy Blues\".\n\nWhile on tour with the Johnny Cash troupe in 1968, Perkins went on a four-day drinking binge that ended in him hallucinating floridly and passing out. When he regained consciousness, he went out to the beach with his last bottle of alcohol. In his autobiography, he described falling to his knees and declaring, \"Lord,&nbsp;... I'm gonna throw this bottle. I'm gonna show You that I believe in you,\" before hurling the bottle into the sea and vowing to remain sober. Perkins and Cash, who had his own substance-abuse issues, supported each other in their bid to remain sober.<ref>[[#gocatgo|Perkins, pp. 309\u2013310.]]</ref>\n\nIn 1968, Cash recorded the Perkins-written \"[[Daddy Sang Bass]]\" (which incorporates parts of the American standard \"[[Can the Circle Be Unbroken (Bye and Bye)|Will the Circle Be Unbroken]]\"), and scored No. 1 on the country music charts for six weeks. \"Daddy Sang Bass\" was a [[Country Music Association]] nominee for Song of the Year. Perkins also played lead guitar on Cash's single \"[[A Boy Named Sue]]\", recorded live at [[San Quentin]] prison, which went to No. 1 for five weeks on the country chart and No. 2 on the pop chart (the performance was also filmed by [[Granada Television]] for broadcast).\n\nPerkins spent a decade in Cash's touring revue, often as an opening act for Cash (as at the Folsom and San Quentin prison concerts, at which he was recorded singing \"Blue Suede Shoes\" and \"Matchbox\" before Cash took the stage; these performances were not released until the 2000s). He also appeared on the television series ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]''.

The show was taped live at the [[Limehouse Studios]]. It was broadcast on [[Channel 4]] on January 1, 1986. Perkins performed 16 songs, with two encores, in an extraordinary performance. He and his friends ended the session by singing \"Blue Suede Shoes\", his most famous song, 30 years after its writing, which brought Perkins to tears.

In 1996 [[Willie Nelson]], who also appeared in that movie, would join Carl in a duett version of the song. During the production of this album, Perkins was diagnosed with [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]]. \nDolly Parton had a Top 20 Country hit in 1991 with the Perkins co-written [[Silver and Gold (Dolly Parton song)|\"Silver and Gold\"]].\n\n[[Mark O'Connor]] recorded a version of the Perkins classic [[Restless (Carl Perkins song)|\"Restless\"]] in 1991 and had a #25 Country hit with it in the US (#19 in Canada).\n\nHe again returned to Sun Studio to record with Scotty Moore, Presley's first guitar player, for the album ''706 ReUNION'', released by Belle Meade Records, which also featured [[D.

In 1993, Perkins performed with the [[Kentucky Headhunters]] in a music video remake of his song \"Dixie Fried\", filmed in [[Glasgow, Kentucky]]. In 1994, he teamed up with [[Duane Eddy]] and [[the Mavericks]] to contribute \"Matchbox\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nHis last album, ''[[Go Cat Go!]]'', released by the independent label Dinosaur Records in 1996, features Perkins singing duets with [[Bono]], Johnny Cash, [[John Fogerty]], George Harrison, Paul McCartney, [[Willie Nelson]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Paul Simon]], and [[Ringo Starr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/albums/go_cat_go.html |title=Carl Perkins/Various Artists: Go Cat Go! |publisher=Theband.hiof.no |access-date=2011-11-25}}</ref><ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Carl Perkins|chart=all}} ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}</ref>\n\nHis last major concert performance was the [[Music for Montserrat]] all-star charity concert at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]] on September 15, 1997, four months before his death.\n\n==Personal life==\nA strong advocate for the prevention of child abuse, Perkins worked with the Jackson Exchange Club to establish the first center for the prevention of child abuse in Tennessee and the fourth in the nation. Proceeds from a concert planned by Perkins were combined with a grant from the [[National Exchange Club]] to establish the Prevention of Child Abuse in October 1981. For years its annual Circle of Hope Telethon generated one quarter of the center's annual operating budget.<ref>Tennessee Historical Commission</ref>\n\nPerkins had one daughter, Debbie, and three sons, Stan, Greg, and Steve.  Stan, Perkins' firstborn son, is also a recording artist. In 2010, he joined forces with [[Jerry Naylor]] to record a duet tribute, \"To Carl: Let It Vibrate\".

He received the Billboard's New Artist of the Year and the Single of the Year Award in 1979. He was inducted into the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]] and was a frequent performer at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Downing was nominated as Best New Artist by the [[Academy of Country Music]] and appeared on ''[[Hee Haw]]'', ''[[Nashville Now]]'', and [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]'' television programs.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early career===\nHe was born in [[Lenapah, Oklahoma]], United States.<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> Downing began his career doing piano and vocals in [[Bobby Poe]] and The Poe Kats,<ref name=\"LarkinGE\"/> who were an early backing band for country entertainer [[Wanda Jackson]]. His piano contributed to the single \"Let's Have A Party\", which was released in 1960. The song reached No. 32 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and made the Top 40 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]].\n\nDowning reached the U.S. Hot 100 with \"You\u2019ll Never Miss the Water (Till the Well Runs Dry)\", a duet with [[Little Esther Phillips]]. After the release of this single, he was signed by [[Warner Brothers]]. In 1974, Downing recorded the single, \"[[I'll Be Holding On]]\", which went to number one on the U.S. [[Disco]] chart for three weeks.<ref>{{cite book |title= Hot Dance/Disco: 1974\u20132003|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=83}}</ref> In addition, \"I'll Be Holding On\" was a hit in Europe.  On the other US charts, the single went to No. 31 on the soul chart and No. 85 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite book |title= Top R&B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942\u20132004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=170}}</ref>\n\n===Country music with Warner Brothers===\nAl Downing's popularity continued to grow, and he had several hits on the country charts between 1978 and 1989. He compiled a list of his own songs, which he presented to his producer at Warner Brothers. In 1978, \"Mr. Jones\" reached the Top 20, followed by \"Touch Me (I'll Be Your Fool Once More)\" in 1979. That same year, Downing produced \"Midnight Lace,\" which reached the 50s on the charts, and \"I Ain't No Fool,\" which peaked at the upper 70s. In 1980, the \"Story Behind The Story\" reached the Top 40 and \"Bring It On Home\" reached the Top 20.\n\nTwo years passed before Downing created another hit, this time with the Team label. In 1982, \"I'll Be Loving You\" reached the Top 50, followed by \"Darlene,\" which reached the lower 60s. The next year, \"It Takes Love\" reached the Top 40, followed by \"Let's Sing About Love,\" which peaked in the mid-60s. In 1984, \"The Best Of Families\" became a Top 50 hit; That same year, Downing released his final hit with the Team label, \"There\u2019ll Never Be A Better Night For Being Wrong\".\n\n===Vine Street years===\nIn 1987, Downing was signed by the [[Vine Street]] label, which released the \"Oh How Beautiful You Are\" (To Me) and \"Just One Night Won't Do,\" both of which hit the Top 70. Two years later, he was signed by Door Knob Records, with whom he produced the 1989 Top 100 hit, \"I Guess By Now.\"\n\nThe popular entertainer [[Fats Domino]] recorded two songs written by Downing: \"Mary, Oh Mary\" and \"Heartbreak Hill\". [[Bobby Bland|Bobby \"Blue\" Bland]] and [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] have also recorded Downing's songs.\n\n===Later career===\nDowning built a five-decade career around his powerful singing voice and his hard-driving rockabilly-style piano. Downing's compilations of earlier work have been released throughout the world. In Europe, Crazy Music obtained exclusive rights for the original Team label recordings and released these in the form of a 2-CD compilation, ''Classic Collection''. This also contained some of Downing's earlier hits, including \"Mr. Jones.\"\n\nIn July 2002, he played the Oneida Casino's Rock'n'Roll Festival in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] with dozens of other rockabilly musicians.\n\nIn 2003, Downing released his first new album in more than a decade, ''One of A Kind''. The album received favourable radio and print reviews. It ranked third on ''American Roots Country'' and was commended for featuring 14 memorable tracks. He continued to give regular performances at the Grand Ole Opry. In 2000, he was nominated as a member of the Rockabilly Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame.\n\nDowning continued to perform on more than 75 occasions per year in the remaining years of his life. He appeared at [[Ontario]]'s [[Havelock Country Jamboree]] with [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[Roy Clark]]. In 2005, Downing postponed plans for a European tour that was set to begin on July 1 in Austria. He was hospitalized and diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic [[leukemia]]. Soon after, he commenced [[chemotherapy]] treatment. Downing died on July 4, 2005.\n\n==Style==\nDowning's musical style found its roots in a variety of musical styles including [[rock and roll]], [[blues]], roots, [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[country music|country]]. He performed [[rhythm and blues]] and [[disco]] throughout the 1960s and 1970s, when he lived in [[Washington, D.C.]]  He eventually reclaimed his musical roots by turning to country music.\n\n== Producer ==\nIn additional to his work as a recording artist and performer, Downing also worked as a music producer. During late 1990s and early 2000s, he worked with several European musicians as an [[artists and repertoire]] (A&R) agent. In 2003, he produced the album, ''Straight Beat'', with the Italian bluesman Edo 'Ndoss, which included songs written by Downing that he had not recorded himself. Downing's piano work on this album represented his last recording.\n\n==Discography==\n===Albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Year\n! Album\n! <small>[[Top Country Albums|US Country]]</small>\n!

She was one of the few women working in the male-dominated rock and roll music field during the 1950s and one of country music's early female innovators. Martin was nicknamed the Female Elvis for her dance moves on stage, similar to those of [[Elvis Presley]].\n\n==Biography==\n{{More citations needed |date=June 2018}}\n\n===Early life and rise to fame===\nMartin was born in [[Sutherlin, Virginia]], east of [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]]. Her mother was a stage mother, and her father and uncle were both musicians. Before she was six, Martin was already singing and playing the guitar, inspired by [[Eddy Arnold]] and [[Hank Williams]]. \nOver the years, this resulted in statewide contests with over 200 contestants, which she won. As a result, Janis was asked to play on the same bill as [[Cowboy Copas]] and [[Sunshine Sue]].  Through them Martin became a member of the [[Old Dominion Barn Dance|Old Dominion Barndance]] on [[WRVA (AM)|WRVA]], which came out of Richmond every Saturday Night on CBS network. When she was in her mid-teens, she was appearing with country singers including Arnold, [[Hank Snow]], [[The Browns]] and [[Jim Reeves]].  She soon claimed she was tired of country music and began a rock and roll career.\n\n===Teen rock and roll star===\nThe WRVA station announcer, Carl Stutz, wrote a song titled \"Will You Willyum\", and asked Martin to sing the song live on stage that Saturday night so that he could make a demo tape to send to his publisher in New York. A week later, Stutz called Martin to tell her that [[RCA Victor]] was interested in recording \"Will You Willyum\". As it happened, the publisher offered \"Will You Willyum\" to [[Steve Sholes]], a producer at RCA Victor, and asked whether Sholes had an artist to record it. Apparently Sholes replied \"Well, who's the girl doin' the demo?\"\n\nAt age 15, Martin signed with RCA Victor in March 1956, just two months after Elvis Presley joined the label. She recorded \"Will You Willyum\" on March 8, 1956, backed by her own composition \"Drugstore Rock 'n Roll\".\n\nThe song became the biggest hit of her career, selling 750,000 records. Soon Martin was performing on ''[[American Bandstand]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' and ''[[Tonight Starring Steve Allen]]''. She also appeared on ''[[Ozark Jubilee|Jubilee USA]]'', and the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'' in Nashville, Tennessee, becoming one of the younger performers to ever appear. ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her Most Promising Female Vocalist that year.\n\nPresley and RCA were so impressed with Martin's stage presence that they dubbed her the Female Elvis.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=April 7, 1956 |title=Review spotlight on... |pages=44 |magazine=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZB8EAAAAMBAJ&dq=janis+martin+female+elvis&pg=PA44 |access-date=March 29, 2022}}</ref><ref>[[Sun Records]] also dubbed [[Jean Chapel]] the female Elvis Presley in 1956 when she began recording rockabilly songs including \"I Won't Be Rocking Tonight\".</ref> Presley sent a dozen red roses to her when she appeared at the RCA Victor convention in [[Miami, Florida]]. [[Colonel Tom Parker]], Elvis' manager, offered to take over her management seeing the potential of a successful double \"boy-girl\" bill. Just before, due to his extremely taxing touring schedule, Elvis had collapsed on stage in New York due to exhaustion. Safeguarding the young Janis Martin from this, her parents decided to not accept Parker's offer, and instead go with the head of the Old Dominion shows. RCA chose Martin to tour as a member of the [[Jim Reeves]] show and continued recording rock and roll and country material that ended up being successful on both charts, including \"My Boy Elvis\", \"Let's Elope Baby\", her cover of [[Roy Orbison]]'s song \"[[Ooby Dooby]]\", and \"[[Love Me to Pieces]]\".\n\nOn January 7, 1956, Martin eloped with her boyfriend, a paratrooper. She told her parents of her marriage only after her husband was safely shipped overseas in Germany. Her father tried to have it annulled because she was only 15 years old. Eventually, the matter was left, but Janis' mother ordered her to keep her marriage a secret to safeguard her career. In 1957, Janis went on a [[USO]] tour in Europe with [[Jim Reeves]], [[Del Wood]] (a pianist famous for performing the song \"Down Yonder\"), [[The Browns]], and [[Hank Locklin]]. Her husband got a 30-day leave and went on the road with her, which resulted in her getting pregnant with her son. Martin's teenage pregnancy caused RCA Victor to drop her in 1958. It was probably during this period that a 10\" LP album titled ''Janis and Elvis'' was released in South Africa. This was recalled immediately upon request from the U.S. because it suggested the idea that the two performers were singing together. Although [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] and [[Decca Records]] were interested, she signed with the Belgian label [[Palette Records|Palette]] in 1960.\n\n===Later career===\nBy 1960, Martin was on her second marriage, and her husband demanded she leave the music business. In the 1970s, she began performing again with her newly formed band, The Variations. In 1975, she was working for the [[Halifax, Virginia]], Police Department when music historian Dennis West tracked her down. Edd Bayes, a record collector from Maryland, asked Dennis for her address, which Dennis gave to him. He then coaxed her to appear locally and tell her story in ''Goldmine'' magazine. Martin toured through Europe as part of the rockabilly revival there, and in 1979 Bayes convinced RCA to pull four Martin songs from their vault, which were then released on [[Dog Gone Records]] in 1977. Edd Bayes took one of the songs that had been recorded twice (\"Love Me Love\") at different tempos and added the 'cha cha' to the title. In the 1980s, the [[Bear Family]] label gathered Martin's complete record history with the compilation album ''The Female Elvis''. Since the early 1980s Janis started performing again at Rockabilly shows through Europe and the US. One of her live shows was released on a CD called ''Here I Am'' on [[Hydra Records]].  In 1995, Martin appeared on [[Rosie Flores]]'s ''Rockabilly Filly'' album for [[HighTone Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rockabilly Filly Overview|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rockabilly-filly-mw0000177263|website=AllMusic.com|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref> Flores recorded an album with Martin six months before her death, but it was not released until September 18, 2012, as [[The Blanco Sessions]] by [[Cow Island Music]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Janis Martin, 'The Female Elvis,' Returns|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/09/30/161968431/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-returns|website=NPR Music|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Flores|first1=Rosie|title=JANIS MARTIN \" The Female Elvis\", Final Recording Sessions|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1383637978/janis-martin-the-female-elvis-final-recording-sess|website=Kickstarter|access-date=March 7, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\nMartin died from cancer on September 3, 2007, at [[Duke University Medical Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].

His best known record was \"Ten Long Fingers\", recorded in 1958.\n\n==Life and career==\nBorn in [[Dallas, Texas]], he was encouraged to be an entertainer as a child.  He initially learned the [[steel guitar]],<ref name=Morrison>[https://books.google.com/books?id=qAHvUO5GknMC&dq=%22joe+poovey%22&pg=PA158  Craig Morrison, ''Go Cat Go!: Rockabilly music and its makers'', University of Illinois Press, 1996, p.158]</ref> and made his first recordings at the age of 10.  Two years later, in 1953, he formed a group, the Hillbilly Boys, and started weekly broadcasts on radio station [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]], soon followed by work as a disc jockey on the \"[[Big D Jamboree]]\" radio show. He also recorded several Christmas-themed songs, including \"Santa's Helper\", written by his father Bernice Poovey.  After opening a show for [[Elvis Presley]] in 1955, he instantly changed his musical style from traditional country music to rockabilly.  In 1957, as '''Jumping Joe Poovey''', he recorded \"Move Around\" on the [[Dixie Records|Dixie]] label, produced by Jim Shell in Dallas.  It was followed the next year by \"Ten Long Fingers\", a tribute to [[Jerry Lee Lewis]], on which he was credited as \"Groove Joe Poovey\" {{sic}}.   Although the record was later acclaimed as a classic rockabilly number, featuring piano by local prodigy C.B. Oliver, it was only locally successful, and Poovey remained working in the Dallas and [[Fort Worth]] area, recording occasionally for small local labels.<ref name=hall>[http://rockabillyhall.com/JoePoovey1.html  Groovey Joe Poovey at the Rockabilly Hall of Fame]</ref><ref name=tsha>[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpo69  The Handbook of Texas Online: Groovey Joe Poovey]</ref><ref name=blackcat>[http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/groovey_joe_poovey.htm  Groovey Joe Poovey at Black Cat Rockabilly]</ref><ref name=allmusic>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/joe-poovey-p366176/biography  Biography by Jason Ankeny at Allmusic.com]</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s he returned to playing country music and worked as a songwriter, his songs being recorded by such musicians as [[George Jones]] and [[Johnny Paycheck]].  In 1966, using the pseudonym '''Johnny Dallas''', he recorded \"Heart Full of Love\", which reached no. 62 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|country chart]].  However, follow-ups failed to match its success, and he retired from performing to concentrate on his work as a disc jockey, working on various radio stations in the Dallas \u2013 Fort Worth area.  In the 1970s, his earlier records began to be recognised by rockabilly fans in Europe, where he first performed in 1980, and unreleased recordings from the 1950s were made available.  He also began recording again, releasing several new singles under the name '''Texas Joe Poovey'''.  At the same time, he worked as a chauffeur on the film set of the ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' TV series.<ref name=hall/><ref name=tsha/><ref name=blackcat/><ref name=allmusic/>\n\nHe continued to make regular visits to Britain and Europe, performing both country and rockabilly music, into the 1990s.

By all accounts the singer was not held in much regard by Phillips, but Feathers often made the audacious claim that he had arranged \"[[That's All Right]]\" and \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\" for [[Elvis Presley]]. He also claimed that his \"We're Getting Closer (To Being Apart)\" had been intended to be Elvis' sixth single for Sun. He did, however, get his name on one of Elvis' Sun records, \"[[I Forgot to Remember to Forget (song)|I Forgot To Remember To Forget]]\" when the writer Stan Kesler asked him to record a demo of the song.<ref name=\"AMG\">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p4241/biography|pure_url=yes}} Charlie Feathers biography] at [[AllMusic]]</ref><ref name=bc>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabilly.nl/artists/feathers.htm|title= Black Cat Rockabilly Biography of Charlie Feathers|accessdate=July 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nHe then moved on to [[Meteor Records]] and then [[King Records (USA)|King Records]] where he recorded his best-known work.  His 1950s singles included \"Peepin' Eyes\", \"Defrost Your Heart\", \"Tongue-Tied Jill\" and \"Bottle to the Baby\". When his King contract ran out he still continued to perform, although Feathers thought there was a conspiracy to keep his music from gaining the popularity it deserved.<ref name=bc/>\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he performed at times at new music nightclubs like the Antenna Club in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], sharing the bill with [[rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] bands like [[Tav Falco's Panther Burns]], who, as devoted fans of Feathers, had introduced him to their label's president.<ref name= \"Panther\">{{cite news |last=Sprague |first=David |url= https://variety.com/2001/music/reviews/panther-burns-1200467792/ |title=Panther Burns |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=April 17, 2001 |accessdate=September 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHe released his ''New Jungle Fever'' album in 1987 and ''Honkey Tonk Man'' in 1988, featuring the lead guitar work of his son, Bubba Feathers.

Since the 1950s, she has recorded and released music in the genres of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Country music|country]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]]. She was among the first women to have a career in rock and roll, recording a series of 1950s singles that helped give her the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nickname]] \"The Queen of Rockabilly\". She is also counted among the first female stars in the genre of country music.\n\nJackson began performing as a child and later had her own radio show in Oklahoma City. She was then discovered by country singer [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]], who helped her secure a recording contract with [[Decca Records]] in 1954. At Decca, Jackson had her first hit single with the country song \"[[You Can't Have My Love]]\". She then began touring the following year with [[Elvis Presley]]. The two briefly dated and Presley encouraged her to record in the [[Rockabilly]] style. In 1956, Jackson signed with [[Capitol Records]] where she was given full permission to record both country and Rockabilly. The label released a string of Jackson's rock  singles, including \"[[Fujiyama Mama]]\", \"Mean Mean Man\" and the top 40 hit \"[[Let's Have a Party]]\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Jackson moved back to the country genre and had several charting singles during the decade. This included \"[[Right or Wrong (Wanda Jackson song)|Right or Wrong]]\", \"[[In the Middle of a Heartache]]\", \"[[Tears Will Be the Chaser for Your Wine]]\" and \"[[A Woman Lives for Love]]\". In addition, she also recorded several selections for the German language market overseas. In 1965, the German single \"[[Santo Domingo (song)|Santo Domingo]]\" reached number one on the Austrian pop chart. After re-discovering [[Christianity]] in 1971, Jackson made [[gospel music]] a priority in her career. She left Capitol Records in 1973 and signed with [[Word Records]] to focus more on the gospel circuit. Over the next two decades, she released a series of gospel discs.\n\nIn 1984, Jackson was sought out by European promoters to tour overseas. The same year, she released her first rock album in two decades and launched a new career in the genre. In the 1990s, her rock records were noticed again by American audiences and she began touring alongside fellow Rockabilly artist [[Rosie Flores]]. During this period, she released several commercially acclaimed albums in the rock and roll style, including ''[[Heart Trouble (album)|Heart Trouble]]'' (2003) and ''[[I Remember Elvis]]'' (2006). Following her 2009 induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], Jackson collaborated with musician [[Jack White]] to record the commercially successful ''[[The Party Ain't Over]]''. For several years, she kept a busy touring schedule before announcing her retirement from performing in 2019. She released her 32nd and final studio project, ''[[Encore (2021 Wanda Jackson album)|Encore]]'', in 2021.\n\n==Early life==\nJackson was the only child born to parents Tom and Nellie Jackson in [[Maud, Oklahoma]].<ref name=\"Oklahoma\">{{cite web |last1=Carney |first1=George O. |title=Jackson, Wanda LaVonne: The Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture |url=https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |website=Oklahoma History.org |access-date=9 July 2021 |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184947/https://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=JA002 |url-status=live }}</ref> Her father worked multiple jobs, including a gas station attendant and delivery truck driver.

Nellie Jackson often had Jackson sing while she was out of sight, to ensure her daughter was accounted for.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=6-8}} In Los Angeles, Jackson was introduced to [[western swing]] music.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She enjoyed hearing music by popular western acts like [[Bob Wills]] and [[Rose Maddox]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|pp=8-10}} At age six, her father introduced Jackson to the guitar. She also took guitar lessons and was soon skillful enough to play it alongside her father.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}\n\nIn the mid 1940s, the family relocated to [[Bakersfield, California]] where Tom Jackson took a job as a [[barber]]. She also took piano lessons and continued to play the guitar.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}} It was during this period that she began having trouble with academics. Jackson recalled the experience in her book: \"All I wanted to do was sing and play music, and it was impossible for me to sit still,\" she recounted in her autobiography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=15}} When Jackson was nine, the family moved back to their home state, this time living in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> Her father found employment as a taxi cab driver and her mother worked on an air force base.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=13-15}}\n\nIn Oklahoma City, Jackson sang in the local Baptist church and engaged in more performance opportunities.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}} She auditioned for the local radio station, KPLR, after being peer-pressured by friends.

I liked it,\" she explained in her biography.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=36-38}}\n\nAs a teenager, Jackson attended [[Capitol Hill High School]] in Oklahoma City<ref name=\"Oklahoman\">{{cite news |last1=Willert |first1=Tim |title=Singer Wanda Jackson among alumni to be honored by Oklahoma City school foundation |url=https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3890992/singer-wanda-jackson-among-alumni-to-be-honored-by-oklahoma-city-school-foundation |access-date=9 July 2021 |publisher=[[The Oklahoman]] |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709184754/https://www.oklahoman.com/article/3890992/singer-wanda-jackson-among-alumni-to-be-honored-by-oklahoma-city-school-foundation |url-status=live }}</ref> and continued her radio show.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=44}} She also dated fellow student, Leonard Sipes, who would later go by the name [[Tommy Collins (singer)|Tommy Collins]].{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=45-46}} In 1952, Jackson was heard on the air by country singer and local resident, [[Hank Thompson (musician)|Hank Thompson]].<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> The singer invited Jackson to perform with him at the Trianon Ballroom in Oklahoma City. On Thompson's show, Jackson sang \"Blue Yodel No. 6\" backed by his band the Brazos Valley Boys. The performance led to a regular gig singing alongside [[Merl Lindsay]]'s country band.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=40-44}} Jackson was always performing, and at times neglected her social life. \"[Wanda] never had time for dates, nothing like that. Just that guitar \u2013 that's all she thought about,\" a high school friend recalled.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201}}\n\n==Career==\n===1953\u20131955: Country beginnings===\nJackson also continued working with Hank Thompson. In 1953, she appeared with him regularly on his local television program and on a similar program for 30 minutes hosted by KPLR. Thompson also recorded Jackson on several demonstration recordings in hopes they would be heard by major record labels. Thompson was also attempting to get his band member Billy Gray a recording contract, and had the pair sing several duets.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} Jackson was supposed to be signed by Thompson's label, [[Capitol Records]], but was rejected by producer [[Ken Nelson (American record producer)|Ken Nelson]]. \"Girls don't sell records!\" he told Thompson.{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}} In her book, Jackson recalled hearing Nelson's statement: \"I recognize that Ken wasn't being sexist, so much as he was thinking about business. But it still gave me a little nudge to prove him wrong!\"{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59}}\n\n[[File:Wanda Jackson--1956.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Jackson was known for her spaghetti strap dresses, designed by her mother.]]\nInstead Thompson contacted [[Paul Cohen (record producer)|Paul Cohen]] of [[Decca Records]], who was interested in signing Jackson and Billy Gray.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=59-60}} In 1954, while still high school, Jackson signed with the label.{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=201-202}} In March 1954, the Jackson family traveled to [[Hollywood, California]] where she recorded her first Decca sessions backed by Thompson's band. She cut several solo sides, along with the Billy Gray duet, \"[[You Can't Have My Love]]\". Jackson disliked the song, but Thompson convinced her to record it.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=60-62}} It was soon released as Jackson's debut single on Decca and became a major hit, climbing to the number eight spot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country and Western Sides]] chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\">{{cite book|last=Whitburn|first=Joel|title=Hot Country Songs 1944 to 2008|publisher=Record Research, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-0-89820-177-2}}</ref> Upon Decca's encouragement, Jackson and Gray recorded a second duet, titled \"If You Don't Somebody Else Will\". Released as a single, the song was a commercial failure due to a competing version by [[Jimmy & Johnny]] that reached the charts.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\" />{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=64}}\n\nInstead of touring, Jackson started her senior year in fall 1954 and finished high school. She was part of the school band and acted in the musical ''[[Anything Goes]]''.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=66-68}} In March 1955, she returned to the recording studio, this time working with Paul Cohen at the Decca studio in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Jackson also did her first performance at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] while in town.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=69-70}} For the performance, her mother made a dress fitted with [[spaghetti strap]]s and a [[neckline|sweetheart neckline]]. Host [[Ernest Tubb]] told her it was unacceptable, so she covered it with a fringe jacket. She later recalled hearing fellow Opry members making negative comments about her while she was onstage.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Carrigan |first1=Henry |title=THE READING ROOM: Wanda Jackson's Stories Assure 'I'm Still Here' |journal=[[No Depression (magazine)|No Depression]] |date=April 4, 2019 |url=https://www.nodepression.com/the-reading-room-wanda-jacksons-stories-assure-im-still-here/ |access-date=12 July 2021 |archive-date=July 12, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210712014844/https://www.nodepression.com/the-reading-room-wanda-jacksons-stories-assure-im-still-here/ |url-status=live }}</ref> \"I decided that night that the ''Grand Ole Opry'' scene was not for me,\" she recounted.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=chapter 6}}\n\nIn 1955, Jackson graduated from Capitol Hill High School in Oklahoma City and began touring.

With Hank Thompson's help,{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=18}} she secured a new contract with Capitol Records the same year.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> At her first Capitol recording session, Jackson cut two country songs and one rock and roll selection. One song, \"[[I Gotta Know (Wanda Jackson song)|I Gotta Know]]\", incorporated elements of both country and rock. According to Jackson, the song's mixture of rock allowed her to get acquainted with the genre.{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=119}} Released as a single in 1956, \"I Gotta Know\" became Jackson's second commercially successful release, peaking at number 15 on the ''Billboard'' country and western sides chart.<ref name=\"Whitburn Billboard\"/> Jackson continued recording rock and roll music under her Capitol contract and was given full permission to do so by producer Ken Nelson. Jackson also composed several of her Capitol recordings, including \"Baby Loves Him\", \"Cool Love\" and \"Mean Mean Man\".{{sfn|Bomar|Jackson|2017|p=123-27}} She continued recording country music as well, often putting each style on either side of a single release.<ref name=\"allmusic\"/>{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=276}}\n\nWriters and critics have remarked positively about Jackson's recordings from the 1950s and noted their take on women's sexuality.

In addition, they commented that Jackson's rock records were \"sexually aggressive\" and demonstrated \"almost frightening savagery\".{{sfn|Oermann|Bufwack|2003|p=202}} Bruce Eder added that Jackson's material was at times \"astonishingly raucous and even raunchy\".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eder |first1=Bruce |title=''Queen of Rockabilly'': Wanda Jackson: Songs, reviews, credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-of-rockabilly-mw0000618189 |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=14 July 2021 |archive-date=July 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714034504/https://www.allmusic.com/album/queen-of-rockabilly-mw0000618189 |url-status=live }}</ref> Meanwhile, Kurt Wolff found that Jackson's rock material was also mixed with traditional country elements, which added to her musical individuality: \"Jackson mixed straight country material and hot-to-the-core rockabilly numbers almost right from the beginning...Songs like 'Fujiyama Mama' and 'Mean Mean Man' were hard and fast, giving her plenty of reason to shimmy around in her glamorous fringe dresses\".{{sfn|Wolff|2000|p=275}}\n\nIn 1957, Jackson began working under a new booking agent, who arranged several tours in 1957 and 1958.

In 1946 his family moved to [[Dallas]], where he played on [[KRLD (AM)|KRLD]]'s ''[[Big D Jamboree]]''. By 1951 he was playing on the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]''; that year he signed to [[Capitol Records]] and released his first single, \"I Keep the Blues All the Time\", as Jimmy Lee. Capitol released seven further singles from Fautheree before dropping him in 1952. Despite never charting, the recordings have been cited as influential on later rockabilly artists, including [[James Burton]].\n\nFautheree subsequently found work as a [[session musician]] for musicians such as [[Faron Young]] and [[Webb Pierce]]. Along with [[\"Country\" Johnny Mathis]], he performed on ''Louisiana Hayride'' as [[Jimmy & Johnny]], and released a charting single under the \"Jimmy Lee & Johnny Mathis\" moniker on [[Chess Records]], 1954's \"If You Don't, Somebody Else Will\". Fautheree left Mathis to work with Wayne Walker, a partnership that lasted only four months but yielded a few recordings. Following this he began recording with his brother Lynn, again under the name Jimmy & Johnny; they signed to [[Decca Records]], but by 1957 the pair had moved back to Dallas.\n\nFautheree went back to solo recording, recording in [[New Orleans]] in 1958 at J&M Studio. He recorded briefly with Mathis again between 1958 and 1959. Some self-released material and a single on [[Paula Records]] brought him into 1960, and throughout the next decade Fautheree worked increasingly in the genre of [[gospel music]].\n\nBy the 1970s Fautheree had left the business, working in [[asbestos]] removal. In 1995, he returned to music with Mathis, recording a new single, \"It Won't Be Much Longer\", together. He played both in the U.S. and abroad in the 2000s, and released a full-length album with [[Deke Dickerson]] entitled ''I Found the Doorknob''. Shortly after the album was complete he died of [[cancer]] in Dallas on June 29, 2004.\n\nHis mother's name was Lodema Hammonds, the daughter of Mack Hammonds of Maud, Texas, who was a descendant of [[Phillip Hamman]], the Savior of the Greenbrier.\n\n==Discography==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"30\" | Year\n! width=\"350\" | Title\n! width=\"150\" | Record label\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Love Is Hard To Understand / I Keep the Blues All The Time'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Go Ahead and Go / Knocking On Your Front Door'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1951 || ''Lips That Kiss So Sweetly / I\u2019ve Got A Broken Heart'' || Capitol Records \n|----\n| 1952 || ''Suspense / Warm Warm Kisses'' || Capitol Records \n|----\n| 1952 || ''I\u2019m Diggin\u2019 A Hole To Bury My Heart / Kisses By Mail'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1952 || ''Blowin\u2019 And Goin\u2019 / Mistakes'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1953 || ''How About A Date / Cryin\u2019 Won\u2019t Change My Mind'' || Capitol Records\n|----\n| 1955 || ''Lips That Kiss So Sweetly / Love Me'' (with Wayne Walker) || Chess Records\n|----\n| 1958 || ''Teenage Wedding / Baby It\u2019s Love'' (as ''Johnny Angel'') || Vin Records\n|----\n| 1966 || ''Git / Can\u2019t Find The Doorknob'' || Paula Records  \n|----\n| 1966 || ''Keep Me In Mind / Belle Of Monterrey'' || Paula Records\n|----\n| 1974 || ''Project X-9 (Instr.) / I\u2019m The Laziest Man In The World'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| 197? || ''If You Want To Be Saved / Fellowship With Jesus'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| 197? || ''I Just Can\u2019t Keep On / One Day Smiling'' || Lodema Records\n|----\n| unknown || ''This Ole House / Heaven Is Only Knee High'' || Little Richie Records\n|----\n| 1963 || '''''EP''''' \n* ''Nobody Knows Where You Go''\n* ''Please Talk To My Heart''\n* ''Taffy Town'' (by Fran Powers)\n* ''Goin\u2019 Steady'' (by Fran Powers)\n|| Towne House Records\n|}\n\n==References==\n*[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p75324/biography|pure_url=yes}} Jimmy Lee Fautheree] at [[Allmusic]]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fautheree, Jimmy Lee}}\n[[Category:1934 births]]\n[[Category:2004 deaths]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American rockabilly musicians]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Arkansas]]\n[[Category:American session musicians]]\n[[Category:People from Smackover, Arkansas]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Arkansas]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

From age eight he starred alongside his family in the radio and television series ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''. In 1957, he began a long and successful career as a popular recording artist. \n\nHis fame as both a recording artist and television star also led to a motion picture role co-starring alongside [[John Wayne]], [[Dean Martin]], [[Walter Brennan]], and [[Angie Dickinson]] in [[Howard Hawks]]'s [[Western (genre)|western]] feature film ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959). He placed 54 songs on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and its predecessors between 1957 and 1973, including \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\" in 1958, which was the first number one song on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's then-newly created [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100 chart]]. He recorded 17 additional top ten hits and was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] on January 21, 1987.{{sfn|Whitburn|1983|p=491}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=284}} In 1996 Nelson was ranked No. 49 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.<ref name=\"fifty\" />\n\nNelson began his entertainment career in 1949, playing himself in the radio sitcom series ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet''. In 1952, he appeared in his first feature film, ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]''. In 1957, he recorded his first single (\"I'm Walkin' b/w \"A Teenager's Romance\", Verve 10047X4S), debuted as a singer on the television version of the sitcom, and released the No. 1 album ''[[Ricky (album)|Ricky]]''. In 1958, Nelson released his first #1 single, \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\", and in 1959 received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for \"Most Promising Male Newcomer\" after starring in ''Rio Bravo''. A few films followed, and when the television series was cancelled in 1966, Nelson made occasional appearances as a guest star on various television programs. In his twenties, he moved away from the pop music of his youth and began to perform in a [[country rock]] style.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |title=Rick Nelson Biography |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2022-11-23 |archive-date=November 24, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221124044719/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rick-nelson-mn0000364912 |url-status=live }}</ref> After recording several albums with mostly [[session musician]]s, most of which flopped, he formed the Stone Canyon Band in 1969 and experienced a career resurgence, buoyed by the live album ''[[In Concert at the Troubadour, 1969]]'' and had a surprise hit with 1972's \"[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]]\", which peaked at number six on the Billboard Hot 100. His comeback was short-lived, however, as his record label was bought out and folded, and his followup albums were not well promoted by his new label. He continued to perform live and take small television roles through the 1970s, though his label dropped him by the end of the decade. He released two more albums, with unimpressive results, before [[Death of Ricky Nelson|his death in a plane crash]] on New Year's Eve, 1985.\n\nNelson was married once, to [[Kristin Nelson|Sharon Kristin Harmon]], from 1963 until their divorce in 1982. They had four children: actress [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Nelson]], twin sons and musicians [[Gunnar Nelson (musician)|Gunnar]] and [[Matthew Nelson (musician)|Matthew]], and actor Sam.\n\n==Early life==\nNelson was born on May 8, 1940, in [[Teaneck, New Jersey]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=2, 16\u201317}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=25}}<ref name=\"NOTE\" /> He was the second son of entertainment couple [[Ozzie Nelson|Ozzie]] and [[Harriet Nelson]]. His father was of half Swedish descent. The Nelsons' older son was actor [[David Nelson (actor)|David Nelson]].\n\nHarriet, normally the vocalist for Ozzie's band, remained in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], with her newborn and toddler. Meanwhile, bandleader Ozzie toured with the Nelson orchestra.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=17}} The Nelsons bought a two-story colonial house in [[Tenafly, New Jersey]],{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=17}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=26}}<ref name=\"Cotten\" /> and six months after the purchase, moved with son David to Hollywood, where Ozzie and Harriet were slated to appear in the 1941\u201342 season of [[Red Skelton]]'s ''The Raleigh Cigarette Hour;'' Ricky remained in Tenafly in the care of his paternal grandmother.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=18}} In November 1941, the Nelsons bought what would become their permanent home: a green and white, two-story, Cape Cod colonial home at 1822&nbsp;Camino Palmero in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=19}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=26}} Ricky joined his parents and brother there in 1942.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=19}}\n\nRicky was a small and insecure child who suffered from severe [[asthma]]. At night, his sleep was eased with a vaporizer emitting tincture of evergreen.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=19\u201320}} He was described by Red Skelton's producer [[John Guedel]] as \"an odd little kid\", likable, shy, introspective, mysterious, and inscrutable.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=20}} When Skelton was drafted in 1944, Guedel crafted the radio sitcom ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]'' for Ricky's parents.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=20}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=29}} The show debuted on Sunday, October 8, 1944, to favorable reviews.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=21}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=30}} Ozzie eventually became head writer for the show and based episodes on the fraternal exploits and enmity of his sons.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=22}} The Nelson boys were first played in the radio series by professional child actors until twelve-year-old Dave and eight-year-old Ricky joined the show on February 20, 1949, in the episode \"Invitation to Dinner\".{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=24\u201325}}{{sfn|Dennis|2013|p=15}}\n\n[[File:Adv of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson Family 1952.jpg|thumb|The Nelson family, 1952]]\nIn 1952, the Nelsons tested the waters for a television series with the theatrically released film ''Here Come the Nelsons.'' The film was a hit, and Ozzie was convinced the family could make the transition from radio's airwaves to television's small screen. On October 3, 1952, ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet'' made its television debut and was broadcast in first run until September 3, 1966, to become one of the longest running sitcoms in television history.\n\n==Education==\nNelson attended Gardner Street Public School,{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=23}} Bancroft Junior High,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=47}} and, between 1954 and 1958, [[Hollywood High School]], from which he graduated with a B average.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} He played [[American football|football]] at Hollywood High{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=52}} and represented the school in interscholastic [[tennis]] matches.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=55}} Twenty-five years later, Nelson told the ''[[Los Angeles Weekly]]'' he hated school because it \"smelled of pencils\" and he was forced to rise early in the morning to attend.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=53}} In January 1960 the athletic Nelson brothers formed a trapeze act with stunts in the 1/27/1960 episode of \"Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" titled 'THE CIRCUS'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/579275570816609584/|title=RICKY NELSON on the TRAPEZE!

Although his parents permitted him a $50 allowance at the age of eighteen, Ricky was often strapped for cash and one evening collected and redeemed empty pop bottles to gain entrance to a movie theater for himself and a date.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=54\u201355}}\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Debut===\nNelson played clarinet and drums in his [[tween (demographic)|tweens]] and early teens, learned the rudimentary guitar chords, and vocally imitated his favorite [[Sun Records]] [[rockabilly]] artists in the bathroom at home or in the showers at the [[Los Angeles Tennis Club]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=66}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=62}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=2}} He was strongly influenced by the music of [[Carl Perkins]] and once said he tried to emulate the sound and the tone of the guitar break in Perkins's March 1956 [[Top 40|Top Ten]] hit \"[[Blue Suede Shoes]]\".{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=62}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=2}}\n\nAt age sixteen, he wanted to impress his girlfriend of two years, Diana Osborn(e), who was an [[Elvis]] fan and, although he had no record contract at the time, told her that he, too, was going to make a record.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=66}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=60}}{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=1}} With his father's help, he secured a one-record deal with [[Verve Records]], an important jazz label looking for a young and popular personality who could sing or be taught to sing.{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Holdship|2005|p=1}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=69}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=64}} On March 26, 1957, he recorded the [[Fats Domino]] standard \"[[I'm Walkin']]\" and \"[[A Teenager's Romance]]\" (released in late April 1957 as his first single),<ref name=\"pc11\" /> and \"[[You're My One and Only Love]]\".{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=64}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=71}}\n\nBefore the single was released, he made his television rock-and-roll debut on April 10, 1957, singing and playing the drums to \"I'm Walkin'\" in the ''Ozzie and Harriet'' episode \"Ricky, the Drummer\".{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=72}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=66}} About the same time, he made an unpaid public appearance, singing \"[[Blue Moon of Kentucky]]\" with [[The Four Preps]] at a Hamilton High School lunch-hour assembly<ref name=\"pc11\" /> in Los Angeles and was greeted by hordes of screaming teens who had seen the television episode.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=75}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=68}}\n\n\"[[I'm Walkin']]\" reached No. 4 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Best Sellers in Stores chart, and its flip side, \"[[A Teenager's Romance]]\", hit #2.{{sfn|Bronson|2003|p=154}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=68}} When the television series went on summer break in 1957, Nelson made his first road trip and played four state and county fairs in [[Ohio]] and [[Wisconsin]] with the Four Preps, who opened and closed for him.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=70}}\n\n===First album, band, and #1 single===\nIn early summer 1957, Ozzie Nelson pulled his son from Verve after disputes about royalties and signed him to a lucrative five-year deal with [[Imperial Records]] that gave him approval over song selection, sleeve artwork, and other production details.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=78\u201379}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=73\u201374}} Ricky's first Imperial single, \"[[Be-Bop Baby]]\", generated 750,000 advance orders, sold over one million copies, and reached No. 3 on the charts. Nelson's first album, ''Ricky'', was released in October 1957 and hit #1 before the end of the year.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=76}} Following these successes, Nelson was given a more prominent role on the ''Ozzie and Harriet'' show and ended every two or three episodes with a musical number.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=80}}\n\nNelson grew increasingly dissatisfied performing with older jazz and country session musicians, who were openly contemptuous of rock and roll. After his Ohio and Minnesota tours in the summer of 1957, he decided to form his own band with members closer to his age.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=81}} Eighteen-year-old electric guitarist [[James Burton]] was the first signed. Bassist James Kirkland, drummer Richie Frost, and pianist Gene Garf completed the band.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=83}} Their first recording together was \"[[Believe What You Say]]\". Prior to this, [[Joe Maphis]] had been playing the lead guitar part, and played lead on his first hits \"Be-Bop Baby\", \"Stood Up\", and \"Waitin In School\".\n\nIn 1958, Nelson recorded 17-year-old [[Sharon Sheeley]]'s \"[[Poor Little Fool]]\" for his second album, ''Ricky Nelson'', released in June 1958.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=89}} Radio airplay brought the tune notice, and Imperial suggested releasing a single, but Nelson opposed the idea, believing a single would diminish EP sales. When a single was released nonetheless, he exercised his contractual right to approve any artwork and vetoed a picture sleeve.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=89\u201390}} On August 4, 1958, \"Poor Little Fool\" became the #1 single on ''Billboard'''s newly instituted Hot 100 singles chart{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=91}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=90}} and sold over two million copies.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=90}}\n\nNelson stated:\n{{blockquote|Anyone who knocks rock 'n' roll either doesn't understand it, or is prejudiced against it, or is just plain square. \u2013 ''[[NME]]'' \u2013 November 1958<ref name=\"NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 3\" />}}\n\n[[File:Ricky Nelson - publicity.JPG|thumb|Nelson publicity photo, 1960]]\nDuring 1958 and 1959, Nelson had twelve hits in the charts in comparison with [[Elvis Presley|Elvis Presley's]] eleven.

In the summer of 1958, Nelson conducted his first full-scale tour, averaging $5,000 nightly. By 1960, the Ricky Nelson International Fan Club had 9,000 chapters around the world.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=92\u201393}}\n{{blockquote|Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in my career was when six girls tried to fling themselves under my car, and shouted to me to run over them.

Ozzie Nelson even had the idea to edit footage together to create some of the first music videos. This creative editing can be seen in videos Ozzie produced for \"Travelin' Man\". Nelson appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1967, but his career by that time was in limbo. He also appeared on other television shows (usually in acting roles). In 1973, he had an acting role in an episode of ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} He starred in the episode \"A Hand For Sonny Blue\" from the 1977 series ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected]]'' (known in the United Kingdom as ''Twist in the Tale''). In 1979, he guest-hosted on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', spoofing his television sitcom image by appearing in a ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' sendup in which, always trying to go \"home,\" he finds himself among the characters from other 1950s/early 1960s-era sitcoms, ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'', ''[[Father Knows Best]]'', ''[[Make Room for Daddy]]'', and ''[[I Love Lucy]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nNelson knew and loved music and was a skilled performer even before he became a [[teen idol]], largely because of his parents' musical background. Nelson worked with many musicians of repute, including [[James Burton]], [[Joe Osborn]], and [[Allen \"Puddler\" Harris]], all natives of [[Louisiana]], and [[Joe Maphis]], [[The Jordanaires]], [[Scotty Moore]], and [[Johnny Burnette|Johnny]] and [[Dorsey Burnette]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nNelson's music was very well recorded with a clear, punchy sound\u2014thanks in part to engineer Bunny Robyn and producer Jimmy Haskell.<ref name=\"Tech\" />\n\nFrom 1957 to 1962, Nelson had 30 Top-40 hits, more than any other artist except Presley (who had 53) and [[Pat Boone]] (38). Many of Nelson's early records were double hits with both the A and B sides hitting the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\nWhile Nelson preferred [[rockabilly]] and [[uptempo]] rock [[songs]] like \"[[Believe What You Say]]\" (Hot 100 #4), \"[[I Got a Feeling (Ricky Nelson song)|I Got a Feeling]]\" (#10), \"[[My Bucket's Got a Hole in It]]\" (#12), \"[[Hello Mary Lou]]\" (#9), \"It's Late\" (#9), \"[[Stood Up (song)|Stood Up]]\" (#2), \"[[Waitin' In School (song)|Waitin' in School]]\" (#18), \"[[Be-Bop Baby]]\" (#3), and \"[[Just a Little Too Much]]\" (#9), his smooth, calm voice made him a natural to sing ballads.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} He had major success with \"[[Travelin' Man]]\" (#1), \"[[A Teenager's Romance]]\" (#2), \"Poor Little Fool\" (#1), \"[[Young World (song)|Young World]]\" (#5), \"[[Lonesome Town]]\" (#7), \"[[Never Be Anyone Else But You]]\" (#6), \"[[Sweeter Than You]]\" (#9), \"[[It's Up to You (Ricky Nelson song)|It's Up to You]]\" (#6), and \"[[Teen Age Idol]]\" (#5), which clearly could have been about Nelson himself.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}\n\n==Film actor==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2022}}\n[[File:Howard Hawks'Rio Bravo trailer (33-2).jpg|thumb|upright|Nelson in ''Rio Bravo'', 1959]]\n[[File:John Wayne and Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson in 'Rio Bravo', 1959.jpg|thumb|right|upright]]\nIn addition to his recording career, Nelson appeared in movies. He made his film debut in ''[[Here Come the Nelsons]]'' (1952) and had a small role in ''[[The Story of Three Loves]]'' (1953) at MGM directed by [[Vincente Minnelli]] playing [[Farley Granger]] as a boy.\n\nFollowing his success on TV and with singing, [[Howard Hawks]] cast him as a gunslinger in ''[[Rio Bravo (movie)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959) with [[John Wayne]] and [[Dean Martin]]; Hawks attributed much of the film's box office success to Nelson.\n\nNelson co-starred with [[Jack Lemmon]] in ''[[The Wackiest Ship in the Army (film)|The Wackiest Ship in the Army]]'' (1960), which was popular enough to give rise to a TV series (in which Nelson did not appear). He guest starred on ''[[General Electric Theatre]]'' (\"The Wish Book\") and starred in a romantic comedy feature written and directed by his father, ''[[Love and Kisses (1965 movie)|Love and Kisses]]'' (1965) with [[Jack Kelly (actor)|Jack Kelly]].\n\nNelson guest starred on ''[[Hondo (TV series)|Hondo]]'' (playing [[Jesse James]]), and had a support role in ''[[The Over-the-Hill Gang]]'' (1969) with [[Walter Brennan]] and [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]].\n\nNelson was in ''[[Fol-de-Rol]]'' (1972), guest starred on ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[The Streets of San Francisco]]'', ''[[Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law]]'', ''[[Petrocelli]]'', ''[[Quinn Martin's Tales of the Unexpected|A Twist in the Tale]]'', ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'', and ''[[The Love Boat]]''. On ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' he played the part of \"Tony Eagle\" and performed various well-known Nelson songs throughout the episode.\n\nHe had support roles in the TV films ''[[Three on a Date]]'' and ''[[High School USA]]'' (1983).\n\n==Name change and 1960s career==\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2022}}\nOn May 8, 1961 (his 21st birthday), he officially modified his recording name from \"Ricky Nelson\" to \"Rick Nelson\". His childhood nickname proved hard to shake, especially among the generation who had watched him grow up on \"Ozzie and Harriet\". Even in the 1980s, when Nelson realized his dream of meeting [[Carl Perkins]], Perkins noted that he and \"Ricky\" were the last of the \"rockabilly breed\".\n\nIn 1963, Nelson signed a 20-year contract with [[Decca Records]]. After some early successes with the label, most notably 1964's \"For You\" (#6), Nelson's chart career came to a dramatic halt in the wake of [[Beatlemania]], [[The British Invasion]], and later the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture era]]. However, instead of dropping him, Decca kept him on board.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Nelson began to move toward [[country music]], becoming a pioneer in the country-rock genre. He was one of the early influences of the so-called \"[[California Sound]]\" (which would include singers like [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Linda Ronstadt]] and bands such as [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]). Yet Nelson himself did not reach the [[Top 40]] again until 1970, when he recorded [[Bob Dylan]]'s \"She Belongs to Me\" with the Stone Canyon Band, featuring [[Randy Meisner]], who in 1971 became a founding member of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], and former [[The Buckaroos|Buckaroo]] steel guitarist [[Tom Brumley]].\n\n==\"Garden Party\" and short-lived comeback==\n[[File:Rick Nelson performing 1970.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Nelson performing on ''The Jim Nabors Show'' in 1970]]\nIn 1972, Nelson reached the Top 40 one last time with \"[[Garden Party (Rick Nelson song)|Garden Party]],\" a song he wrote in disgust after a [[Richard Nader]] [[Oldies]] Concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] where the audience booed, perhaps against some unrelated police action. However, Nelson may have felt that the reason was because he was playing new songs instead of just his old hits.<ref name=\"straightdope1\" /> When he performed [[The Rolling Stones]]' \"[[Honky Tonk Women]],\" there was booing, said to be against police and not him.<ref name=\"straightdope1\" /> He was watching the rest of the performance on a TV monitor backstage until Richard Nader finally convinced Nelson to return to the stage and play his \"oldies.\" He returned to the stage and played his \"oldies\" and the audience responded with applause, according to Deborah Nader, President of Richard Nader Entertainment. He wanted to record an album featuring original material, but the single was released before the album because Nelson had not completed the entire ''Garden Party'' album yet. \"Garden Party\" reached No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #1 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart]] and was certified as a [[RIAA certification|gold single]]. The second single released from the album was \"Palace Guard\" which peaked at #65.\n\nIn 1973, [[MCA Records]], whose parent company [[MCA Inc.]] had owned American Decca since 1962, ceased the label's operations, and transferred Nelson (and many other Decca artists) to its roster. His comeback was short-lived, and Nelson's band soon resigned. MCA wanted Nelson to have a producer on his next album. A new band was formed by [[Lindy Goetz]], then a promotion person at MCA Records.<ref name=\"GoodReads\" /> Nelson's band moved to Aspen and changed their name to \"Canyon.\" Nelson and the new Stone Canyon Band began to tour for the ''[[Garden Party (album)|Garden Party]]'' album. Nelson still played nightclubs and bars, but he soon advanced to higher-paying venues because of the success of ''Garden Party.''\n\nIn 1974, MCA was unsure as to what to do with the former teen idol. Albums like ''[[Windfall (Rick Nelson album)|Windfall]]'' failed to have an impact. Nelson became an attraction at theme parks like [[Knott's Berry Farm]] and [[Disneyland]]. He also started appearing in minor roles on television shows.\n\nNelson tried to score another hit but did not have any luck with songs like \"Rock and Roll Lady.\" With seven years to go on his contract, MCA dropped him from the label.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Rick kris nelson 1964.JPG|thumb|Ricky and Kristin Nelson in 1964]]\n\nIn 1957, when Nelson was 17, he met and fell in love with [[Marianne Gaba]], who played the role of Ricky's girlfriend in three episodes of ''Ozzie and Harriet''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=136}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=72}} Nelson and Gaba were too young to enter a serious relationship, although according to Gaba \"we used to [[Making out|neck]] ''for hours''.\"{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=137}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=73}}\n\nThe next year, Nelson fell in love with 15-year-old [[Lorrie Collins]], a country singer appearing on a weekly telecast called ''Town Hall Party''.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=106}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=81}} The two wrote Nelson's first composition, the song \"My Gal\", and she introduced him to [[Johnny Cash]] and [[Tex Ritter]]. Collins appeared in an ''Ozzie and Harriet'' episode as Ricky's girlfriend and sang \"Just Because\" with him in the musical finale.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=83}} They went steady and discussed marriage, but their parents discouraged the idea.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=83, 116}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=138, 145}}\n\n===Kris Harmon===\nAt Christmas 1961, Nelson began dating [[Kristin Nelson|Kristin Harmon]] (June 25, 1945 \u2013 April 26, 2018), a daughter of football player [[Tom Harmon]] and actress [[Elyse Knox]] (n\u00e9e Elsie Kornbrath) and the older sister of [[Kelly Harmon|Kelly]] and [[Mark Harmon]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|pp=138, 140\u2013141}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=140}} The Nelsons and the Harmons had long been friends, and a union between their children held great appeal.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=139}} Rick and Kris had much in common: quiet dispositions, Hollywood upbringings, and high-powered, domineering fathers.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=140}}\n\nThey married on April 20, 1963. Kris was pregnant,{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=149}} and Rick later described the union as a \"[[shotgun wedding]]\".{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=144}} Nelson, a nonpracticing Protestant, received instruction in Catholicism at the insistence of the bride's parents{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=144}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|pp=137, 149}} and signed a pledge to have any children of the union raised in the Catholic faith.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=149}} Kris Nelson joined the television show as a regular cast member in 1963.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=145}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=150}} They had four children: actress [[Tracy Nelson (actress)|Tracy Kristine Nelson]], twin sons Gunnar Eric Nelson and Matthew Gray Nelson who formed the band [[Nelson (band)|Nelson]], and Sam Hilliard Nelson.\n\nBy 1975, following the birth of their last child, the marriage had deteriorated and a very public, controversial divorce involving both families was covered in the press for several years. In October 1977, Kris filed for divorce and asked for alimony, custody of their four children, and a portion of community property. The couple temporarily resolved their differences, but Kris retained her attorney to pursue a permanent break.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=230}}{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=205}} Kris wanted Rick to give up music, spend more time at home, and focus on acting, but the family enjoyed a recklessly expensive lifestyle, and Kris's extravagant spending left Rick no choice but to tour relentlessly.{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=251}} The impasse over Rick's career created unpleasantness at home. Kris became an alcoholic and left the children in the care of household help.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=218}} After years of legal proceedings, they were divorced in December 1982. The divorce was financially devastating for Nelson, with attorneys and accountants taking over $1&nbsp;million.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=221}} Years of legal wrangling followed.{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=237}}{{sfn|Selvin|1990|p=262}}\n\n===Helen Blair===\n{{anchor|Helen Blair}}\nIn 1980, Nelson met Helen Blair, a part-time model and exotic-animal trainer, in [[Las Vegas]].{{sfn|Bashe|1992|p=242}} Within months of their meeting, she became his road companion, and in 1982 she began living with him.

Thompson then joined the Dixie Jazzlanders who toured Mississippi.  He relocated to [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and made an unreleased recording in 1956.  \"Love My Baby\" was issued on the Phillips International label in September 1957, and Thompson toured alongside [[Sonny Burgess]] and [[Billy Lee Riley]].  The following year, Thompson moved again, this time to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he gained a residency at the Rivoli Ballroom, Chicago's latest country music venue.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\nThompson's recording of \"$16.88\" for [[Kapp Records]] sold sufficiently to secure him an offer to record his debut album.  ''Here's Hayden Thompson'' was released in 1967.  Several recordings took place in the early-1970s, but circumstances meant that Thompson left the music industry at this point and worked as a limo driver.  He re-emerged in the mid-1980s, becoming a regular performer on rockabilly revival touring packages.  Charley Records released an album of his in 1985.<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>  Further albums were released, mainly by various European record labels, over the three decades. These included ''The Time Is Now'' (1990).<ref name=\"Larkin50\"/>\n\n==Albums==\n{| border=\"2\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" rules=\"all\"  style=\"margin:1em 1em 1em 0; border-style:solid; border-width:1px; border-collapse:collapse; empty-cells:show;  \"\n|- bgcolor='#FFDEAD'\n!Year\n!TITLE/track listing\n!Catalog number\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''[[Kapp Records]] (US)'''</big>\n|----\n|1967\n|''Here's Hayden Thompson''\nLife's Gone And Slipped Away / You Don't Have To Be A Baby To Cry / I'll Kiss You Again / Tell Me That's The Way It Will Be / We Know / Sixteen Eighty-Eight / Blue Blue Day / Waiting on Her / These Boots Are Made For Walkin' / Why / Look Who's Coming / And She Cried\n|KL-1507 (LP)\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''Charly Records (UK)'''</big>\n|----\n|1985\n|''Booneville Mississippi Flash''\nAh Poor Little Baby / Drivin' Me Out of My Mind / Born To Lose / Had A Little Talk / Don't Say That You're Sorry / I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Cry / Eenie Meenie Minie Mo / Hands of Time / The Boy From Tupelo / I Wanna Get Home / A Girl Named Betty / When My Blue Moon Turns To Gold Again\n|CR 30245 (LP)\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''Sunjay Records (SWE)'''</big>\n|----\n|1985\n|''The Rockin' Country Man''\nAh Poor Little Baby / Drivin' Me Out of My Mind / Born To Lose / Had A Little Talk / Don't Say That You're Sorry / I'm Gonna Sit Right Down And Cry / Eenie Meenie Minie Mo / Hands of Time / The Boy From Tupelo / I Wanna Get Home / When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again / A Girl Named Betty<small><br />reissue of Charly CR 30245</small>\n|SJLP 563 (LP)\n|----\n|1990\n|''The Time Is Now''\nPretty Little Love Song / Wishful Thinking / Fried Chicken / Wrong Road Again / At The Party Tonight / I Still Miss Someone / Ain't That Loving You Baby / Tell Me That's The Way It'll Be / I Ain't Taking No Prisoners / Stonecold Heart / Careless Hands / Boy From Tupelo\n|SJLP 589 (LP)\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''Spark Records (HOL)'''</big>\n|----\n|1990\n|''The Time Is Now''\nPretty Little Love Song / Wishful Thinking / Fried Chicken / Wrong Road Again / At The Party Tonight / I Still Miss Someone / Ain't That Loving You Baby / Tell Me That's The Way It'll Be / I Ain't Taking No Prisoners / Stonecold Heart / Careless Hands / Boy From Tupelo<small><br />reissue of Sunjay SJLP 589</small>\n|CD 13 (LP)\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''[[St. George Records]] (USA)'''</big>\n|----\n|2005\n|''Rockabilly Rhythm''\nMama's Little Baby / Love My Baby / Rockabilly Boogie / Reelin' & Rockin' / Milk Cow Blues Boogie / Let's Get Gone / Sugar-Coated Love / Boppin' High School Baby / Chicago River Blues / Hang Out / Can't Hardly Stand It / Gonna Rock & Roll Tonight / Boppin' The Blues / Blue Moon of Kentucky\n|STG 7714 (CD)\n|----\n|bgcolor='#E0E0E0' colspan='4' align='left'|<big>'''Bluelight Records (FIN)'''</big>\n|----\n|2007\n|''Hayden Thompson''\nSorrow Break A Good Man Down / Black Cloud / Big River / Just To Satisfy You / I've Got It Again / Sixteen Dollars Eighty-eight Cents / Midnight Blues / I'd Run A Mile To You / I Wanna Get Home / Ninety Seven More To Go / Drive Me Out of My Mind / Four Strong Winds / No Love Have I / Still Nineteen / Mystery Train a.k.a.
