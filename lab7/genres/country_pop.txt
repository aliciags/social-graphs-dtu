McClain's biggest hits include \"[[Who's Cheatin' Who]]\", \"[[Sleepin' with the Radio On]]\", and \"[[Radio Heart (Charly McClain song)|Radio Heart]]\".\n\n==Early life==\nMcClain was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], United States,<ref name=\"AMG\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/charly-mcclain-mn0000772541/biography|title=Charly McClain &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=8 August 2021}}</ref> to Virginia (n\u00e9e Wiggins; 1934\u20132009) and Niles McClain. The nickname \"Charly\" would come from the neighborhood friends that she played with as a child.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> McClain used it when she began her career playing hotel [[lobby (room)|lounges]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> Her first experience recording was when father Niles had [[tuberculosis]] when she was eight.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> As she was under age to comply with [[hospital]] visiting policy, she had to communicate with him through a [[tape recorder]].<ref name=\"AMG\"/> That inspired her interest in recording.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> She began her musical career at age 12 performing with her brother Mike and their band, Charlotte & the Volunteers. The band  performed together for the next six years.\n\nHer first TV appearance was on the local [[WBBJ-TV|WBBJ]] morning show in [[Jackson, Tennessee]]. By the age of 17, she was a regular on the club circuit, and appeared at the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] show ''Mid-South Jamboree'' from 1973\u20131975.\n\n==Recording career==\n{{BLP sources section|date=November 2022}}\n\n===Steady rise===\nAt the age of 20, McClain signed her first recording contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1976. McClain's distinct vocal sound provided an edge in recognizability\u2014as did her attractive appearance.<ref name=\"AMG\"/> McClain debuted in late 1976 with her first [[Promotional recording|single]], \"Lay Down,\" which peaked at No. 67 on the [[Hot Country Songs|Billboard Country Chart]]. McClain's initial singles in 1976 and 1977, from her debut [[album]] ''Here's Charly McClain,'' failed to appear highly on the country chart. McClain's second album, ''Let Me Be Your Baby,'' was released in 1978. She hit country's Top Ten for the first time in 1978 with \"[[That's What You Do to Me]],\" <ref name=\"AMG\"/> followed by two other Top 25 hits, \"Let Me Be Your Baby,\" and \"Take Me Back.\"\n\nIn 1979 McClain released ''Alone Too Long'', which included the Top-20 hits \"When A Love Ain't Right\" and \"You're a Part of Me\". The ''Women Get Lonely'' album followed in 1980, featuring the Top 10 hit \"[[Men (Charly McClain song)|Men]]\",<ref name=\"AMG\"/> which peaked at No. 7 in 1980, and the Top-20 duet with [[Johnny Rodriguez]], \"I Hate the Way I Love It.\" However, breakthrough success still eluded McClain.\n\n===Achieving success===\nMcClain hit No. 1 on the country chart in 1981 with \"[[Who's Cheatin' Who]]\".<ref name=AOL>{{Cite web |url=http://music.aol.com/artist/charly-mcclain/biography/1001431 |title=Charly McClain biography at AOL.com |access-date=2008-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413194048/http://music.aol.com/artist/charly-mcclain/biography/1001431 |archive-date=2010-04-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 1981, McClain scored three Top-10 hits off her ''Surround Me with Love'' album: the [[Surround Me with Love|title track]], \"[[Sleepin' with the Radio On]]\", and \"[[The Very Best Is You]]\".<ref name=\"AMG\"/> McClain's albums were beginning to become more successful as well. Her ''Who's Cheatin' Who'' album peaked at No. 28 on the ''Top Country Albums'' chart, and her 1981 album, ''Surround Me With Love'' went to number 9.\n\nIn 1983, McClain hit No. 1 again with her [[Mickey Gilley]] duet \"[[Paradise Tonight]].\"<ref name=\"AMG\"/><ref name=AOL/> McClain's and Gilley's duet partnership became so successful, they released a duet album the following year titled ''It Takes Believers.'' The record contained the Top-5 hit, \"[[Candy Man (Roy Orbison song)|Candy Man]]\" (No. 5 on the Billboard Country Chart), and the top 20 hit, \"The Right Stuff\".\n\nMcClain also acted; she appeared as a guest star on such shows as ''[[Hart to Hart]]''<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> (in 1981 episode titled \"Rhinestone Harts\") and ''[[CHiPs]]'' (in 1983 episode \"Country Action\"). McClain's lonely life on the road was also chronicled in a 1981 [[HBO]] special titled ''So You Want to Be a Star.''\n\nAfter having a series of hit singles in 1984, McClain released another best-selling album, ''Radio Heart'' in 1985. The album's [[Radio Heart (Charly McClain song)|title track]] became a No. 1 Country hit in 1985; McClain's last No. 1 to date. The album also spawned two other Top-10 hits that year. McClain married former soap star [[Wayne Massey]] in 1984, and their duet \"[[With Just One Look in Your Eyes]]\" reached number five.<ref name=AOL/> The third single off the album was also a duet with Massey. It was titled \"[[You Are My Music, You Are My Song]]\". The ''Radio Heart'' album peaked at No. 15 on the ''Top Country Albums'' chart in 1985. In 1986, Charly and Wayne released a duet album ''When Love Is Right'' and the first single \"[[When It's Down to Me and You]]\" peaked at No. 17.\n\n==Later years==\nAfter 1986, McClain's success began to subside. Her 1987 ''Still I Stay'' album brought only one Top 40 single; \"[[Don't Touch Me There]]\" peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Country Chart. The album became McClain's last album with [[Epic Records|Epic]]. Upon fulfilling her contract, she parted ways with the record label the following year. She continued to chart until her last recording came in 1989.<ref name=\"AMG\"/>   She recorded one studio album with [[Mercury Records]] before the end of the decade.<ref name=\"LarkinCountry\"/> Her last charted single was \"You Got the Job\", which peaked at No. 65. McClain has not recorded a studio album since 1988's self-titled album on Mercury Records.\n\n==Retirement and family==\nPreferring to spend more time with her husband and their families, McClain retired completely from touring, public appearances, and performances in the early 1990s. Later, she helped to care for her mother Virginia before she died in 2009.<ref name=\"Shackelford Funeral Directors\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.shackelfordfuneraldirectors.com/obituaries/Virginia-Jo-McClain-5820/|website=Shackelfordfuneraldirectors.com|title=Virginia Jo McClain Obituary|access-date=August 8, 2021}}</ref>\n\nCharly McClain and Wayne Massey have no children together. However, Massey does have a son from his first marriage.\n\nSeveral compilation albums of McClain's music have been released over the years. Probably the most noteworthy of these is 1999's ''Anthology.'' It included all of McClain's successful singles from her career with Epic. She continues to reside with her husband Wayne in the Memphis, Tennessee, area.\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Charly McClain discography}}\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Organization\n!Award\n!Nominee/Work\n!Result\n|-\n|1979\n|[[Academy of Country Music Awards]]\n|[[Academy of Country Music Award for New Female Artist of the Year|Top New Female Vocalist]]\n|rowspan=2| Charly McClain\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1980\n|Music City News Country Awards\n|Most Promising Female Artist\n|{{won}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3| 1984\n|Academy of Country Music Awards\n|Top Vocal Duo of the Year\n|rowspan=2| [[Mickey Gilley]] and Charly McClain\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| Music City News Country Awards\n|Vocal Duo of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|Female Artist of the Year\n|rowspan=3| Charly McClain\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|1985\n|[[American Music Awards]]\n|Favorite Country Female Video Artist\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 1986\n|rowspan=2| Music City News Country Awards\n|Female Artist of the Year\n|{{nom}}\n|-\n|Vocal Duo of the Year\n|Charly McClain and [[Wayne Massey]]\n|{{nom}}\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040112054559/http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/mcclain_charly/artist.jhtml CMT.com: Charly McClain]\n* {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000772541}}\n* {{discogs artist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{Charly McClain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McClain, Charly}}\n[[Category:1956 births]]\n[[Category:20th-century American singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:20th-century American women singers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American country singer-songwriters]]\n[[Category:American women country singers]]\n[[Category:Singers from Memphis, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Singer-songwriters from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Country musicians from Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Epic Records artists]]\n[[Category:Mercury Records artists]]\n[[Category:21st-century American women]]"}]}}}}{"batchcomplete":"","warnings":{"main":{"*":"Subscribe to the mediawiki-api-announce mailing list at <https://lists.wikimedia.org/postorius/lists/mediawiki-api-announce.lists.wikimedia.org/> for notice of API deprecations and breaking changes.

During his time on the tribe, he was quickly attracted to fellow contestant Brenda Lowe, who became aware of his attraction and used it to her advantage, recruiting him and several others into an alliance. After La Flor won three of the first four tribal immunity challenges, the tribes were blended and Rice ended up on the new version of the original \"older contestants\" tribe, Espada, while Lowe remained on the new version of the La Flor tribe. Rice and Lowe both ultimately made it to the merged group, Libertad, where their alliance successfully caused the eliminations of Alina Wilson and Marty Piombo, before turning on Lowe and eliminating her as a threat. Following Lowe's elimination, Rice continued with the alliance under new leader Matthew \"Sash\" Lenahan. After two contestants (NaOnka Mixon and \"Purple Kelly\" Shinn) quit, the alliance continued eliminating targets Ben \"Benry\" Henry, Jane Bright, Dan Lembo, and Holly Hoffman, although Bright and Hoffman were members of the alliance. The alliance tried to eliminate [[Jud Birza|Jud \"Fabio\" Birza]] as a threat against the jury, but Birza managed to evade them by winning the last three immunity challenges. Rice performed exceptionally well in the post-merge challenges, being on the winning team in two of the three team-oriented rewards, and winning the last two individual rewards. Eventually, Rice made it to the final three with Lenahan and Birza, where he had a chance to win the $1 million as \"Sole Survivor\". In pleading his case to the jury, Rice claimed that he was being open about how he played the game, but was criticized both for his rash decisions and occasional indecisiveness, as well as being perceived as a follower under both Lowe and Lenahan. Although both Rice and Lenahan tried to accuse Birza of not knowing what was going on in the competition, the jury still ultimately chose Birza who received five of the nine votes; Rice received the votes of Hoffman, Bright, Lowe, and Wilson.\n\nOn the nationally televised reunion show, Rice played his single \"Buzz Back\".<ref name=\"Country Song on Season Finale\">{{cite web|last=Wilkening|first=Matthew|title='Survivor' Finalist Chase Rice Debuts Country Song on Season Finale|date=December 20, 2010 |url=http://tasteofcountry.com/survivor-finalist-chase-rice-country-song-season-finale/|publisher=Taste of Country}}</ref> Although he received national media attention on the show, he says that reality show stardom did not help propel his country music career; instead, he cited it as an important life event that was more valuable than money and that put his life in perspective.\n\nIn the official issue of ''[[CBS Watch]]'' magazine, commemorating the 15th anniversary of ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'' in 2015, Rice was voted by viewers as the 10th \"steamiest\" male contestant in ''Survivor'' history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/DaltonRoss/status/565168330513080320 |title=Wait, where's @JohnMCochran? |publisher=Twitter |first=Dalton |last=Ross |date=February 10, 2015 |access-date=February 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Country music career==\n[[File:Chase Rice Mojo Club 2020.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Rice in 2020]]\nChase Rice began playing guitar in college.

Her mother was the country music star [[Dottie West]], whose career spanned three decades. The younger West reached her peak in popularity during the 1980s before mostly retiring in the wake of her mother's death.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===1981\u20131987===\nWest was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and rose to prominence at the same time as her mother Dottie was reinventing herself as a [[country pop]] star, and Shelly's style was not significantly different from that of her mother's. West is best known for her hit [[duet]]s with [[David Frizzell]], especially their number-one hit \"[[You're the Reason God Made Oklahoma]]\". She also was a successful solo artist, having her own number-one hit, \"[[Jos\u00e9 Cuervo (song)|Jos\u00e9 Cuervo]]\" in 1983. West was married to [[Gary Hood]] 1983-2000.\n\n===1987\u20131992: Retirement===\nWest did reunite with Frizzell for a few shows in the late 1980s. West married Garry Hood in 1983 and had twin sons.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p137248/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography at Allmusic.com]</ref> In 1990, Shelly toured with her mother, Dottie; together, they were popular on the road. On August 30, 1991, Dottie was involved in a major car accident, eventually dying five days later, on September 4, from injuries sustained in the accident. West was a technical adviser for a television biopic about her mother's life, ''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'', produced by and starring actress [[Michele Lee]]. At that point, amid major changes in the country music industry that impacted the careers of many established country stars, the younger West retired to focus on her family.\n\n===Post-retirement===\nIn June 2005, CMT honored Shelly and her duet partner, David Frizzell, when they were voted number six on its ''100 Greatest Duets Special''. Although they did not perform any songs, Shelly West and David Frizzell appeared on the special, for which West was interviewed. West appeared on numerous episodes of ''Country Family Reunion'' on [[RFD-TV]].\n\nWest has returned to performing occasionally since 2012. She reunited with David Frizzell for two shows on October 13, 2012, at the God and Country Theater in [[Branson, Missouri]]. The duo played another show on November 2, 2013 at the Americana Theater in Branson.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Studio albums===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:22em;\"| Title\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18em;\"| Album details\n!

This song peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard Country Chart. In 1975, she released ''Whatever I Say Means I Love You'' (ABC/MCA), her fifth and final album for the DOT label, that included \"What Will the New Year Bring?\"\n\nDot Records was acquired by [[ABC Records|ABC]] and there was a noticeable drop-off in chart placings for Fargo, and in 1976, she moved to [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/>\nFargo came out with the ''On the Move'' album, which spawned two Top 20 hits. The next year her next album, ''Fargo Country'' was released.

Fargo's 1978 album, ''Shame on Me'' also yielded two Top 10 hits, the title track and \"[[Do I Love You (Yes in Every Way)]]\", which peaked at No.&nbsp;2.\n\nRecognized as one of the leading country songwriters of the era, Fargo's songs have been recorded by [[Tammy Wynette]], [[Sonny James]], [[Kitty Wells]], [[Tanya Tucker]], [[Jody Miller]], [[Marty Robbins]], [[Dottie West]] and other artists.

For the next few years, the successes came at a lower level.<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/>\nAlthough this serious [[neurological disease|neurological illness]] caused a deep decline in her promotional work, Fargo vowed not to allow the disease ultimately to get to her. In 1979, she recorded a new album, ''Just for You,'' from which the biggest hit was the No. 14 hit \"Daddy\", a new version of a song that Fargo had recorded in 1969. The follow-up, \"Preacher Berry\", peaked outside the Country Top 40.\n\n===1980 \u2013 present: current music career===\nFargo released one more album with Warner Bros. in 1980 before switching to the smaller Songbird label in 1981. She recorded a well-received gospel album in 1981 for [[MCA Records|MCA]]/Songbird, and in 1982, she moved to [[RCA Records|RCA]].<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/> Fargo singles charted off RCA in 1983 and 1984, and she recorded one album for the label in 1983. She recorded a single for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in 1983, and for Cleveland records in 1984. By now, Fargo's career had begun to decline in terms of album sales and chart placements. After several other label changes, Fargo signed with [[Mercury Records|Mercury]], and began another upswing.<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/> She recorded an album with the label, ''Winners,'' which resulted in three singles spawned from the album, including a Top 30 hit, \"Me and You\". Fargo also dueted with [[Billy Joe Royal]] for her next single, \"Members Only\". The song became a Top 25 country hit in 1987, peaking at No.&nbsp;23. In 1991, she released the song \"Soldier Boy\", a reference to the [[Gulf War]] which was going on at the time. The song was Fargo's last charting single. After several years without a full-length recording, in 1992, Fargo began work on her autobiography.<ref name=\"Donna Fargo at\"/> In 2008, Fargo released a new single CD, \"We Can Do Better in America\". On February 4, 2022, PrimaDonna Records announced the release of Donna Fargo's new EP, [http://www.primadonnaentertainmentcorp.com \"ALL BECAUSE OF YOU\"].\n\n==Writing career==\nFargo has pursued other ventures outside of the music business, writing eight books and more than 2,000 greeting cards. She has since established a successful line of [[greeting cards]] in ''The Donna Fargo Collection'' through the ''[[Blue Mountain Arts]]'' Poets and Artists series. She released her fourth book in March 2010, entitled ''I Thanked God For You Today''.<ref>[Blue Mountain Press/P.O.

Her 1973  cover of \"[[Paper Roses]],\" released when she was 14, made her the youngest female act with a number-one country single. Between 1985 and 1986, she also had number-one country singles with \"[[Meet Me in Montana]],\" \"[[There's No Stopping Your Heart (song)|There's No Stopping Your Heart]],\", and \"[[You're Still New to Me]].\" As a television personality, she has been a host of [[Donny & Marie (1976 TV series)|''Donny & Marie'']] (alongside brother [[Donny Osmond]]) and on [[The Talk (talk show)|''The Talk'']].

Between 1998 and 2000, she reunited professionally with Donny for the network talk show ''[[Donny & Marie (1998 TV series)|Donny & Marie]]''. During this period, she publicly spoke about her struggles with [[postpartum depression]],  later the focus of her book ''Behind the Smile: My Journey Out of Postpartum Depression''. In 2004, she hosted her own radio series, entitled ''Marie & Friends'' and, in 2007, appeared in a season of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''.\n\nShe and Donny reunited their act between 2008 and 2019 for a residency at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]]. The show later produced an album of their duets in 2009. In 2010, she returned with the solo studio album ''[[I Can Do This]]''. In 2016, her country album ''[[Music Is Medicine]]'' followed and then, in 2021, came her [[Classical music|classical]] album, ''Unexpected''.
